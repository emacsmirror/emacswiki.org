== About üçâ ==

* Automatic dark / light themes
* Modern CSS, including color variables.
* Minimalistic and hopefully easy on the eyes.
* Printable.
* External <u>linksÀ∫</u> are marked with ##À∫##.
* Does not play around with font sizes.
* Does not play around with animations.
* WCAG AAA compliant!

== Wishful Thinking ==

in the future I may have

* Separate dark / light themes
* Older browser / CSS 2 support
* I have no idea what color to make the links.

== Screenshot üì∏ ==

This screenshot displays the light / dark themes (purple border not included)
