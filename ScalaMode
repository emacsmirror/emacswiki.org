There are two major modes for editing Scala programs.
For more about Scala, see [WikiPedia:Scala_%28programming_language%29 Scala on Wikipedia] and the [http://scala-lang.org Scala website].

The old scala-mode works on emacs 23 and newer. It is available from [[Marmalade]] and from https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/master/tool-support/src/emacs

The new scala-mode2 requires emacs 24 (or newer). It is available from [[MELPA]] and from https://github.com/hvesalai/scala-mode2

SBT support for scala-mode2 is available as a separate mode from https://github.com/hvesalai/sbt-mode

There is also a minor-mode for editing scala programs that use the Scalatra web application framework (see WikiPedia:Scalatra). The mode is available at https://github.com/hvesalai/scalatra-mode

== Without Using the Emacs Package System == 

Here is an example configuration using the old scala-mode with ensime. However ensime now suggests using scala-mode2.

{{{
(setq exec-path (append exec-path (list "/home/seth/.opt/scala/bin" ))) ;;change to location of scala bin!!! necessary for comint.
(require 'scala-mode-auto)
(require 'ensime)
(add-hook 'scala-mode-hook 'ensime-scala-mode-hook)
(eval-after-load "scala-mode" 
 '(progn
    (define-key scala-mode-map (kbd "<f9>") 'ensime-builder-build)
    (define-key scala-mode-map (kbd "<f10>") 'ensime-inf-switch)))

  (eval-after-load "scala-mode" 
    '(progn
       (add-hook 'scala-mode-hook 'ensime-scala-mode-hook)
       (define-key scala-mode-map (kbd "<f9>") 'scala-run)
       (define-key scala-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
       ))

 (defun scala-run () 
    (interactive)   
   (ensime-sbt-action "run")
   (ensime-sbt-action "~compile")
(let ((c (current-buffer)))
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window
   (get-buffer-create (ensime-sbt-build-buffer-name)))
 (switch-to-buffer-other-window c))) 
 (setq exec-path
        (append exec-path (list "~/.opt/scala/bin"))) ;;REPLACE THIS with the directory of your scalac executable!
}}}

I then use [https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs] and [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup sbt]. 

Ok, so create a random file in the source directory created by sbt that contains some random code.
Run ensime-config-project, follow instructions, etc. It should suggest that the project is of type sbt.
Now, run the command 'ensime' -- it should connect with ensime. Now, type C-c C-v s, this will start the scala sbt process. I suggest opening it in another frame by using 'C-x 5 2'. 
 
And you can now hit f9 to run your code - ok, so you have to hit it twice for some reason!
