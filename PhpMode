== Overview ==

Major mode for editing PHP files.

There is a long standing wish to develop a new and better php mode that can be included in Emacs.
Unfortunately the current php-mode.el can not be used as a basis for this since not all contributors have been willing to sign papers for Emacs. Refer to Emacs devel mailing list for more details.

Contributions to a new php-mode are very welcome!

** By default, in GNU Emacs 23.2.1, <tt><nowiki>//</nowiki></tt> comments are not formatted correctly by M-q. The problem is a bug in c-mode, which php-mode 1.5.0 depends on. A [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2010-12/msg01114.html patch] is available and works, but it has to be applied manually: Line numbers don't match.
** [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] contains a variation of the latest php-mode (1.5.0), with some bug fixes and extensions.
** There is also Lisp:php-mode-improved.el, a version by DavidHouse branched from the version in nxhtml-mode that fixes a couple of annoying bugs (see the comments at the top of that file).
** In order to get this mode to work with Emacs 23 I had to add the following lines to my .emacs rather than the ones in php-mode.el.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/898063/making-php-mode-compatible-with-emacs-23 for more information.
{{{
(autoload 'php-mode "php-mode" "Major mode for editing php code." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.php$" . php-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.inc$" . php-mode))

** Based on the Deboutv Xemacs and Sourceforge php-mode.This is mixed mode.  [http://mewde.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-update-for-emacs-php-mode.html Details here.] Some big differences from Deboutv inheritance mode; code comments inserting Sourceforge php-mode style; php-templates doesn't automatic insert; Class-function templates has shortcuts; otherwise; M-x php-template-TAB list all options, then you can select and insert.  We don't have old "Sources" menu, etc.But we have natural Imenu and outline support with additional templates menu.
Auto-completes PHP functions and handles indentation both Sourceforge php-mode and Deboutv php-mode style. It has templating support for class, functions, and loops. Plus; all Sourceforge php-mode features supporting. I tested with emacs23 environment; both vista and Ubuntu hardy; even works with yasnippet mode together; just disable abbrev-minor-mode, or if you are insert php template, function etc; after typing and tabbing completion; type M-Space then going on; it works fine...

== php-mode comparison ==

* Which is better?

(2010-May-26) After comparing the php-mode that comes with nxhtml vs php-mode-improved vs php-mode-new (included in Mewde Project), I found the following:

** *nXHTML variant*: Most up-to-date.  Plenty of bug fixes.
** *Mewde variant*: Includes a template menu that might be useful for new PHP programmers or could even serve as a quick reference.  Also includes helper menu for PHPDocumentor, etc.
** *php-mode-improved.el*: Mostly incorporated into the nXHTML variant but includes a couple of toggles for font-lock that might be helpful.

I may take the template functions from the Mewde variant and maintain them in a separate "add-on" for the nXHTML mode, but I would suggest that most people use the nXHTML variant.



== Related modes ==

Beside those php-mode there are the following possibilities to mix them with better HTML support. See also MultipleModes.

* MuMaMo
* MmmMode
* Lisp:two-mode-mode.el

For example; I don't use any multiple major mode for php; I put all yasnipet html snippets to inside php snippets; and I use with new php-mode for complex php-html code pages.

== Multiple modes with MuMaMo ==

It has built-in support for toggling between html-mode/nxhtml-mode and php-mode. See MultipleModes.

I am including a very slightly modified version of Aaron's php-mode version in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].


== Multiple modes using mmm-mode.el ==

https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode

The PHP mode by FredYankowski explains how to do this in the commentary. For those of you using other PHP modes, add the following to your ~/.emacs:

{{{
(require 'mmm-mode)
(setq mmm-global-mode 'maybe)
(mmm-add-mode-ext-class nil "\\.php3?\\'" 'html-php)
(mmm-add-classes
 '((html-php
    :submode php-mode
    :front "<\\?\\(php\\)?"
    :back "\\?>")))
(autoload 'php-mode "php-mode" "PHP editing mode" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.php3?\\'" . sgml-html-mode))
}}}

If you'd like to know how you can use mmm-mode to combine psgml-mode, php-mode, and css-mode to get a really fancy web authoring environment, take a look at HtmlModeDeluxe.

Another approach is to narrow the buffer of an HTML file to show just the PHP block and switch to PHP-mode.  This is the approach taken by HtmlHelperMode.

== Using two-mode-mode ==

* http://www.braindump.dk/en/wiki/?wikipage=XEmacsPHP (broken)

I found the following in the wayback machine from the site listed above. This mode seems to work quite well is a very light-weight. I had to edit two-mode-mode.el to use 'php-mode' for PHP files rather then C++ mode but other then that, it cooks just fine.

{{{
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(
		("\\.html$" . two-mode-mode)
		("\\.php$" . two-mode-mode)
		("\\.php3$" . two-mode-mode) )
	      auto-mode-alist) )
}}}

== Easy Toggling between PHP & HTML modes ==

I use the following lisp in my JonathanArnoldDotEmacs files:

{{{
;; Toggle between PHP & HTML Helper mode.  Useful when working on
;; php files, that can been intertwined with HTML code
(defun toggle-php-html-mode ()
  (interactive)
  "Toggle mode between PHP & HTML Helper modes"
  (cond ((string= mode-name "HTML helper")
         (php-mode))
        ((string= mode-name "PHP")
         (html-helper-mode))))

(global-set-key [f5] 'toggle-php-html-mode)
}}}

Now I can quickly toggle between PHP & HTML mode, depending on what I'm mostly going to be editing.

== Debugging ==

[https://code.google.com/p/geben-on-emacs/ GEBEN] is a basic debug package that I just discovered and am in the process of trying out. It is a DBGp client (i.e. emacs debug mode using XDebug). -M
[new]
I think this project is dead (and also doesn't work properly) - my posts to the mailing list have met with a deafening silence (a month now, with no activity on the list except my
posts). I recommend removing mention of it from emascwiki.

[new]
Perhaps it is, but I have got a bug report for [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] from someone using it.
And the latest release (version 0.26) was done 2010-03-30.

[new:EngelkeEschner:2011-04-18 13:00 UTC]
I'm using it occasionally and lack a better alternative for emacs, so I recommend keeping it. -- EngelkeEschner

I agree with EngelkeEschner.  I've just started using it, but so far it works smoothly. I've also updated the link. -- MattFlaschen

== Improved Imenu by Class ==

[http://www.oak.homeunix.org/~marcel/blog/articles/2008/07/18/nested-imenu-for-php php-imenu.el] organizes the imenu for php-mode a little differently.  Instead of listing all classes separate from all functions, it lists functions within a class, like most other IDEs do.

[new]
This wasn't included in the recent release of php-mode (2008-11-04), since it was more of a bug-fix release.  However, it is indeed worth investigating in a later release. -- AaronHawley

== Simplest grammar for the Semantic Bovinator ==

[[semantic-php-simplest-grammar.by]]


== Quick documentation lookup ==

I didn't see such a feature in the php-mode I use so I whipped up a quick solution. If you press F1 when standing on a symbol you can quickly look up its online documentation. Here it is:

<pre>
(add-hook 'php-mode-hook 'my-php-mode-stuff)

(defun my-php-mode-stuff ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'my-php-symbol-lookup))


(defun my-php-symbol-lookup ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((symbol (symbol-at-point)))
    (if (not symbol)
        (message "No symbol at point.")

      (browse-url (concat "http://php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern="
                          (symbol-name symbol))))))
</pre>



== Quick documentation lookup with popup help ==

Here's a variation of my quick documentation lookup above. It shows short help for the function under the cursor in the echo area if you press F1. It fetches the info from the official php site and it works for standard functions which documentation is properly tagged. You can press C-F1 for the same behavior as above if quick lookup failed or you want to read more about the function.

<pre>
(add-hook 'php-mode-hook 'my-php-mode-stuff)

(defun my-php-mode-stuff ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'my-php-function-lookup)
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-<f1>") 'my-php-symbol-lookup))


(defun my-php-symbol-lookup ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((symbol (symbol-at-point)))
    (if (not symbol)
        (message "No symbol at point.")

      (browse-url (concat "http://php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern="
                          (symbol-name symbol))))))


(defun my-php-function-lookup ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((function (symbol-name (or (symbol-at-point)
                                    (error "No function at point."))))
         (buf (url-retrieve-synchronously (concat "http://php.net/manual-lookup.php?pattern=" function))))
    (with-current-buffer buf
      (goto-char (point-min))
        (let (desc)
          (when (re-search-forward "<div class=\"methodsynopsis dc-description\">\\(\\(.\\|\n\\)*?\\)</div>" nil t)
            (setq desc
              (replace-regexp-in-string
                " +" " "
                (replace-regexp-in-string
                  "\n" ""
                  (replace-regexp-in-string "<.*?>" "" (match-string-no-properties 1)))))

            (when (re-search-forward "<p class=\"para rdfs-comment\">\\(\\(.\\|\n\\)*?\\)</p>" nil t)
              (setq desc
                    (concat desc "\n\n"
                            (replace-regexp-in-string
                             " +" " "
                             (replace-regexp-in-string
                              "\n" ""
                              (replace-regexp-in-string "<.*?>" "" (match-string-no-properties 1))))))))

          (if desc
              (message desc)
            (message "Could not extract function info. Press C-F1 to go the description."))))
    (kill-buffer buf)))

</pre>


== Collecting all functions for completion ==

This code fetches all php function names from the net and stores it in a list. It can be used for completion with a completion frontend.

<pre>

(defun my-fetch-php-completions ()
  (if (and (boundp 'my-php-symbol-list)
           my-php-symbol-list)
      my-php-symbol-list

    (message "Fetching completion list...")

    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously "http://www.php.net/manual/en/indexes.functions.php")

      (goto-char (point-min))

      (message "Collecting function names...")

      (setq my-php-symbol-list nil)
      (while (re-search-forward "<a[^>]*class=\"index\"[^>]*>\\([^<]+\\)</a>" nil t)
        (push (match-string-no-properties 1) my-php-symbol-list))

      my-php-symbol-list)))


</pre>


== Completion with Company ==

See [[CompanyModeBackends#PhpCompletion]]

== Automatic help with Eldoc ==

See [[ElDoc#Phpdoc]]

== Indentation of arrays ==
The php-mode indentation for array is not good, It will indent like this:
{{{
$post=Post::model()->find(array(
                              'select'=>'title',
                              'condition'=>'postID=:postID',
                              'params'=>array(':postID'=>10),
                              ));
}}}

The better indentation is like:
{{{
$post=Post::model()->find(array(
    'select'=>'title',
    'condition'=>'postID=:postID',
    'params'=>array(':postID'=>10),
));
}}}

Add this to php-mode-hook:
{{{
(add-hook 'php-mode-hook (lambda ()
    (defun ywb-php-lineup-arglist-intro (langelem)
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (cdr langelem))
        (vector (+ (current-column) c-basic-offset))))
    (defun ywb-php-lineup-arglist-close (langelem)
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (cdr langelem))
        (vector (current-column))))
    (c-set-offset 'arglist-intro 'ywb-php-lineup-arglist-intro)
    (c-set-offset 'arglist-close 'ywb-php-lineup-arglist-close)))
}}}

== Closures ==
Php 5.4 introduce anonymous function and indent for those is wrong, here is a patch (kind of hack):
{{{
(defun unindent-closure ()
  "Fix php-mode indent for closures"
  (let ((syntax (mapcar 'car c-syntactic-context)))
    (if (and (member 'arglist-cont-nonempty syntax)
             (or
              (member 'statement-block-intro syntax)
              (member 'brace-list-intro syntax)
              (member 'brace-list-close syntax)
              (member 'block-close syntax)))
       (save-excursion
          (beginning-of-line)
          (delete-char (* (count 'arglist-cont-nonempty syntax)
                          c-basic-offset))) )))

(add-hook 'php-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (add-hook 'c-special-indent-hook 'unindent-closure)))
}}}

== Multimode Indentation ==

As I wasn't able to find anything that would handle indentation of multilingual code properly, I wrote the Web Mixed Indentation.

It indents PHP/JavaScript/CSS/XHTML, and you can download it from

https://github.com/sabof/web-mixed-indentation-mode

It's a minor mode, and does just that - you can use it in conjunction with any major mode.

- sabof




Try also this new indenting/coloring/syntax detection multi-mode (otherwise using std php-mode, js-mode, css-mode, etc.)

== Discussion ==

[new]
I would like comments on both the single and multiple mode choices above. What strengths and weaknesses does the different versions have?
Can they be merged?
-- LennartBorgman

[new]
For myself, I find that most PHP programming I do does not mix HTML and PHP code.  Multiple modes are almost always a mistake ... imho.
-- MarkAHershberger

[new]
Thanks for the comments, Mark.
Multiple major modes are often not the best, but there are a lot of files that uses them.

[new]
How could I use c++ style comment as '//' instead of the old c style '/* */' to comment my codes?

[new]
How do I make a file for etags? I tried a file with all of the functions on separate lines, but it only made a TAGS file with one function.

[new]
Install exuberant-ctags, then use something like:

   etags --language-force=php `find . -name "*.php" -or -name "*.inc" -or -name "*.module" -or -name "*.theme" -or -name \
   "*.engine" -or -name "*.ini"` --language-force=JavaScript `find . -name "*.js" -and -not -name "*.min.js" -and -not -name \
   "*.pack.js" -and -not -name "*_pack.js" -and -not -name "*_stripped.js" -and -not -name "*_mini.js" -and -not -name \
   "swfobject.js" -and -not -name "cal.js" -and -not -path "*/tinymce/jscripts/*" -and -not -name "ext-*.js" -and -not -path \
   "*/files/*" -and -not -path "*/editors/jce/*" -and -not -path "*/libraries/*" -and -not -path \
   "*/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor/*" -and -not -path "*/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/*" -and -not \
  -path "*/com_virtuemart/js/*"  -and -not -path "*/media/system/js/*" -and -not -path "misc/jquery.js"`

[new]
There is a patch of php-mode to handle name spaces and # char comment : http://www.piprime.fr/1401/patch-of-php-mode-for-emacs-in-order-to-handle-namespaces/

[new]
Can we get instructions for '''semantic-php-simplest-grammar.by'''? I've found [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/ lots of related info] but can't identify what is/isn't relevant! [http://cedet.sourceforge.net/addlang.shtml This] shows promise but only explains how to start a new language not how to use/activate them in ECB. Naturally there is a page already [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowToSetUpSemanticBovinatorForANewLanguage#toc3 here on the wiki] but this page is pretty much identical to CEDET's pages referring to reading "further" in the manual.

[new]
apparently, heredoc/newdoc syntax is not recognized and auto-indentation fails badly (tab/spaces before doc-string ending, which is not allowed)
