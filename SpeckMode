Speck is a minor Emacs mode for on-the-fly spell checking. It differs from the existing modes (ispell, flyspell) in the
following aspects:

* Speck checks the spelling of a word if and only if the word is
      actually displayed in an Emacs window.  There are no separate
      commands to check the spelling of a single word, region, or the
      entire buffer.

* Speck's operations are triggered by an idle timer.  In practice
      this means that spelling is checked only when you pause typing.

* You can set up Speck to use different dictionaries for disjoint
      stretches of text in one and the same buffer.

* Speck preserves dictionary and other settings on a per-buffer
      basis.  Hence you can check the spelling of several buffers
      simultaneously, without losing your settings or introducing
      mutual side-effects.

* Dictionary and other settings can be saved to the file you're
      visiting and you can resume editing with restored settings.
