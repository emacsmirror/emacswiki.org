Unfilling a paragraph joins all the lines in a paragraph into a single
line. It is the contrary of FillParagraph.

It works where a line ends with a newline character ("\n") and paragraphs are separated by blank lines.  To make a paragraph end in a single newline then use the function below:

    ;;; Stefan Monnier <foo at acm.org>. It is the opposite of fill-paragraph    
    (defun unfill-paragraph (&optional region)
      "Takes a multi-line paragraph and makes it into a single line of text."
      (interactive (progn (barf-if-buffer-read-only) '(t)))
      (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
        (fill-paragraph nil region)))

    ;; Handy key definition
    (define-key global-map "\M-Q" 'unfill-paragraph)

There is a whole bunch of unfilling functions in ourcomments-util.el in [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]. There is for example already a function unfill-region.
