Has there not been a new version of EmacsW32 since February, 2011?

Those are the official GNU releases, which are not the subject of this page.

%%EmacsW32%%  is referring to the patched and bundled software released at ourcomments.org

''Clarification:'' Those are ''not'' official GNU releases.  The former are official GNU ''development'' snapshots.  The latter are ''unofficial'' GNU Emacs development snapshots.  

But you are correct that neither is the same as what page [[EmacsW32]] is about, which is LennartBorgman's version of Emacs for Windows, which is distributed at http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html.

[now]
Eli Zaretskii seems to be maintaining a 28.2 port here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ (2022)

There's also: https://cygwin.com/packages/summary/emacs-w32.html (29.2-.4, 2024).

Do either of those work here?
