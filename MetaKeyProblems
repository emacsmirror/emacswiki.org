== Intro ==

If your Emacs does not recognize your Alt key as the Meta key anymore,
then you probably have some other key bound to Meta.  In some
distributions, this is the Windows key, or a Penguin key on some
keyboards.  On Macintoshes meta is often the <code>Option</code> key,
which often is caught for other purposes.

The <code>ESC</code> key can be used as a prefix, and often works
without initial hassle.  Well, if running EmacsOnTerminal, better see
below.

On some ports, Emacs finds an existing Meta key and no longer
treats Alt as the Meta key.  You have the following options, then:

* Start using the new Meta key
* Make the new Meta key something else
* Change all Emacs keybindings from Meta to Alt (don't!)
* If using X11, another XModMap config... (Just in case the first didn't work... for me at least!)

== X-window things ==

=== Using the XKB Extension ===

* SettingMetaWithXKB -- Using XKB to set the meta key

=== XFree86 option ===

If you're using XFree86 4, you can get a similar effect by putting
something like this in XF86Config-4:

    Section "InputDevice"
    ...
        # See /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/alt
        Option "XkbOptions" "alt:leftaltismeta"
    EndSection

=== Other keyboard type ===

Select a pc101 keyboard type instead of a pc104.  X doesn't even know
about the Windows/Menu keys anymore, and Emacs works you would expect
it to.  Obviously this trick only works if you don't use the
Windows/Menu/Penguin/whatever keys.

=== Use Super for mod4 ===

Put the following into your ~/.Xmodmap file (create if necessary).

 keycode 115 = Super_L
 keycode 116 = Super_R
 ! Super_L is already mod4 on my system, but Super_R is not
 add mod4 = Super_R

This will make your Windows/Penguin key the Super key.  Thus, Emacs
notices that no key will be Meta and accepts Alt instead of Meta.

This is because Meta and Alt are different and you can bind things to
M-a and to A-a and they should not be confused.  But in the case where
there is no Meta binding, it's preferable to treat Alt as Meta since
Alt bindings are much more rare than Meta bindings in Emacs.

=== Just clear mod4 ===

An alternative to adding the Super [[modifier key]] is to just clear mod4.

Check your xmodmap by running xmodmap or 'xmodmap -pm'.  Assume the
following result:

 shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
 lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
 control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
 mod1        Alt_L (0x40)
 mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
 mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
 mod4        Meta_L (0x73)
 mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

Meta_L is in mod4... that's not good. Just clear it by adding 'clear
mod4' to .Xmodmap or running the command 'xmodmap -e "clear mod4"'.
And now everything is fine.

=== xmodmap background ===

There are several terms and concepts which can be confusing.

 * A keycap is the label on a physical key.
 * A keycode is the numeric value produced by a physical key
   (these may not be the same on two different systems even
   if they use the same software and keyboard layout).
 * A keysym is the meaning assigned to the key.  It is the logical
   value sent to applications when you press that key, is determined
   by the keyboard mapping, and can be changed with xmodmap.
 * A modifier is special state produced by pressing a modifier key.
   Modifiers don't do anything unless another key is pressed.  An
   example is the shift modifier produced while you hold down a
   shift key.  Which keys produce which modifiers is controlled by
   the modifier mapping, and this can be modified with xmodmap.
   There are eight modifiers available, three of which have static
   meanings (shift, control, and lock), and the five others have
   generic names (mod1 through mod5).
 * A modifier key is a physical key which has its keycode listed
   in the modifier map.  It will produce one of the eight modifiers
   while pressed.

Note there are two types of mappings xmodmap can handle: keycode
to keysym and keycode to modifier.  The latter are somewhat
unique to X, and are the most common source of confusion.  In
fact xmodmap makes it somewhat confusing because it's configuration
directives for modifiers are based on keysyms, which it internally
resolves into keycodes. 

Also note that modifiers like Alt, Meta, Super, Hyper, NumLock,
and ScrollLock don't have fixed modifier names -- they are
reported to the application as one of the five generic modifiers.
It is up to the application to determine the meaning of the
modifier.

The way applications are supposed to do this is to inspect the
list of keysyms for the keycodes assigned to that modifier.  For
example upon receiving a key press event with mod1, if mod1's
keycode list includes a keycode with a mapping to Alt_L, this
would mean mod1 is the Alt modifier.  Some applications instead
follow static mapping conventions.  For example mod1 might be
treated as Meta regardless of the assigned keysym.  This used to
be true of Emacs, so you will see lots of advice about putting
Alt, Meta, or Super on specific modifiers.  This shouldn't matter
to current versions of Emacs.

However, to complicate things further, Emacs does implement two
special cases.  First, if there is no modifier with a keycode
with a mapping to Meta_L or Meta_R, Emacs will use the Alt
modifier as the Meta modifier.  And if Alt and Meta correspond
to the same modifier, it will only use the Meta modifier.

Here's the output of xmodmap:

 ~$ xmodmap
 xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

 shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
 lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
 control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
 mod1        Alt_L (0x40)
 mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
 mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
 mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
 mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

As you can see, the Shift keys act as a shift modifier, the Control
keys act as a control modifier, and the left Alt key acts as mod1
modifier.  And in addition to that, you can see that the
"Use Super for mod4" solution has been used in this setup.  There is
no mention of Meta for any modifier, so Emacs will use the Alt
modifier (mod1) as a Meta modifier.

On some keyboards there is a real Meta key.  In that case and in
some other cases you may want Meta to be distinct from Alt.  In that
case you would need to take one of the modifiers (for example mod4),
and assign Meta_L and/or Meta_R and remove any other keycodes.

=== Emacs only changes ===

If this problem exists only on X Windows, I seem to have some luck with
setting x-alt-keysym to meta.  

    (setq x-alt-keysym 'meta)

Or, if you want to use the windows key (or penguin key) as meta, you can do it 
by setting x-super-keysim to meta.

    (setq x-super-keysym 'meta)


== OS Specific things ==

=== MS Windows ===
On MS Windows you can use the Windows keys as Meta keys. 
This allows normal menu handling through the keyboard using the Alt key.
However to do that fully you currently need a slightly patched version of CVS Emacs.
You can get this is from [[EmacsW32]] web site.

==== Via SSH - use PUTTY ====

If you are using windows and access a remote unix or GNU box using a
term, one good term program, IMHO, is PuTTY.  Very small and compact,
yet does all the right things.. and customizable.  Alt is
automatically Meta.  Page up/Down get passed right through to emacs,
etc.  The only problem I have had to date with putty is that the
'pcprint' hasn't worked for me in putty (tried when using
ssh).. anyone?  -- DeepakGoel



=== GNU/Linux ===
==== Use Alt for the Windows Manager ====

On some systems (eg. Debian) the Alt key generates "Alt" and the
Windows key generates "Meta".  Instead of changing things around,
adapt to it and use "Alt" key combinations for the window manager
(eg. Sawfish).  If you use a lot of hotkeys in your window manager,
this is recommended.

=== MacOSX ===

The Apple X11 server application has the meta at the *Option* button,
which is caught by the application itself for various purposes, and
never passes on to the X11 client.  Disabling <code>Enable key
equivalents under X11</code> under the input preferences is one easy
way to fix this, but this will effectively kill a few useful
keybindings of the X11 servers too.

If one is running the native EmacsForMacOS, the variable
<code>mac-command-key-is-meta</code> might be of interest, but it
ought to be true by default.

For some reason under leopard (Mac OS-X 10.0 and higher), internationalization may be turned on. This will result in insertion of a non-ASCII character in the native EmacsForMacOS when you use the Meta key. For example, you may see a "phi" when you type M-X, instead of the behavior you want (this is discussed in  [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Terminal-Coding.html 26.13 Coding Systems for Terminal I/O] in version 23). To disable this emacs-unfriendly behavior, enter the line 
{{{
    (set-keyboard-coding-system nil)
}}} in the initialization (~/.emacs) file. (Does this also fix the related problem in Aquamacs Emacs,  discussed below?)

You can then run emacs from X11 windows (Applications/Utilities/X11.app) with the option/alt key as the meta key. Furthermore, you may use the xmodmap command to remap the command key to Control <i>only</i> under X11. This has the advantage of allowing the command key to behave expectedly with other Mac applications. xmodmap can also ensure that the Alt/Option key is set to be the Meta key in emacs. You can do this with the following ~/.xmodmap file (the lines starting with exclamation points are comments and can be omitted):
{{{
 ! undo any meta keys already set
 clear Mod1
 ! keycodes 63 and 71 are the left and right COMMAND buttons adjacent to the spacebar; set them to be control keys
 keycode 63=Control_L
 keycode 71=Control_R
 ! keycodes 66 and 69 are the option/alt keys; assign them as Meta keys
 keycode 66=Meta_L
 keycode 69=Meta_R
 ! now tell X11 that the Meta keys act as the Mod1 (meta) modier key; that is, when they are pressed with KEY, it is the same as hitting M-KEY
 add Mod1 = Meta_L Meta_R
 ! tell X11 that the Control keys are Control modifiers, so when pressed with u (for example) it is the same as hitting C-u
 add Control = Control_L Control_R
}}}
Use the above file with the command
{{{
    xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
}}}
before starting emacs (for instance, from /etc/bashrc if you use the login shell option to xterm, i.e. <code>xterm -ls</code> in X11/Application/Customize for terminal). 

You can fix c-h so it brings up help (instead of acting as another delete key) by adding these lines to ~/.xmodmap
{{{
  ! Tell X11 that the delete key (above the spacebar) should send a C-? (control questionmark) instead of c-h.
   keycode 59=127
}}}
However, you must then also execute the command <code>stty erase ^?</code>.This tells the terminal session that C-? should be used as a backspace/erase key, instead of C-h. Note that "^?" is NOT the caret followed by a questionmark; it is C-?. Generate ^? by either shift-control-questionmark, or if keycode 59 is already set to 127, by hitting the delete key. In emacs, you may generate it by typing C-q prior to either of those sequences. The two steps of reassigning the delete key (keycode 59) and using stty to make it the backspace should be performed together, i.e. from the /etc/bashrc file. Performing these two steps "frees" C-h to be available for emacs to use as the help key.  [NOTE: If you use both emacs <i>and</i> vim, this may break vim's backspace! One "fix" is to put
{{{
 :imap ^? <left><del> 
}}} into your .vimrc file.]

Alternatively, you can run emacs from Terminal, by changing Terminal's preferences/settings/keyboard and check "Use option as meta key", and the option/alt key should properly behave as the Meta key. You can also remap the Command key to be a control key under System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard/Modifier Keys to use emacs in Terminal. The downside to this approach is that it does not retain the Command key's functionality for use in other Mac applications, 

In AquamacsEmacs, Option (Alt) is mapped to Meta - however, because Option is used to input a lot of non-ASCII characters such as ü or £ on a variety of keyboards, the special character input methods take precedence by default. You can deselect "Option key produces only special characters" in the Options menu to use Option as Meta, or you set the variable mac-command-modifier to 'meta - you will lose functionality, of course. 
If you use a non-English keybboard layout, the emulation modes might be just what you want. While they leave the Option key mapped to Meta, they will allow you to input many common characters ([,],{,},\, etc.) directly with the Option key, just as you would otherwise. You can find them in the Options -> Option Key menu - or use, e.g., M-x emulate-mac-german-keyboard-mode.


In CarbonEmacsPackage, you can set the variable mac-option-modifier to 'meta when your option key is used to input special characters. See also mac-control-modifier and mac-command-modifier if you want to map the meta-key to another modifier key (Ctrl, for example).

Make sure you aren't mapping meta to send another modifier key.  Under System Panel -> Keyboard & Mouse -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys - make sure Option Key is set to Option.

If you want to use your option key as meta in your terminal on the mac, under Terminal -> Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard check off the check box "Option as meta key" 

Best option in Emacs 23 is to revert to Emacs 22 settings (alt is alt, cmd is meta) with this snippet:

    (setq mac-option-key-is-meta nil)
    (setq mac-command-key-is-meta t)
    (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
    (setq mac-option-modifier nil)

If you're running "emacs -nw" in Terminal.app you can swap the cmd and alt keys; see the following blog post:
http://andrewmcdermott.blogspot.com/2009/11/cmd-key-happy-swap-cmdalt-keys-in.html.
Alternatively, you can use [http://swissarmyhammer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/osx-terminal-meta-key-national-characters/ this patch] for iTerm, to get both Meta and normal Option modifier working at the same time.

CocoaEmacs has a group of customizable options named Ns, for adjustment of GNUstep/Mac OS X specific features. 
Some variables in this group can be set to either assign behavior to modifier keys, or remove it to make them behave as usual in Mac OS X.
The variables are named ns-{control,command,altenate,function}-modifier.
(Each has an alias of the form mac-{control,...}-modifier.)
To make a Option (Alt) work as described for AquamacsEmacs above,  set ns-alternate-modifier to none (No modifier) in the customize buffer and save the changes.

== Console and Terminal ==

=== FreeBSD console ===

*Option 1* - Use the <code>ESC</code> key

That is, press then release <code>ESC</code> then hit <code>x</code> to get <code>M-x</code>.

*Option 2* - Use the us.emacs keymap

There is a keymap for Emacs that others report works for them, but it didn't work for me.  To try it, you can run

    kbdcontrol -l /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/us.emacs.kbd

Put 

    keymap="us.emacs"

in /etc/rc.conf to use it permanently.

*Option 3* - Use a customized keymap

Ideally a keymap could send <code>meta</code> with the <code>alt</code> key, but I couldn't figure this out.  Instead I use a customized keymap based off of us.iso.kdb.  First I changed the line with <code>lalt</code> and replaced all instances of <code>lalt</code> with <code>meta</code>.  I did the same for <code>ralt</code>.  Next, I used the <code>windows</code> key on my keyboard to send <code>alt</code>.  To find the scancodes sent for a key, you can use the misc/kbdscan port.  In my case the <code>windows</code> key sends the scancode 105, so I added

     105   lalt   lalt   lalt   lalt   lalt   lalt   lalt   lalt    O

to my customized keymap:

Finally, I add 
     keymap="us.customized.iso"
to /etc/rc.conf to permanently use the customized keymap.

=== NetBSD console ===

For whatever reason, the Alt key does nothing for me.
In /etc/wscons.conf i add these lines near the bottom:

    encoding us.metaesc #this makes meta send esc

I guess this may be more correctly solved by changing the wscons
terminal types to something better than vt100, but I've not been able
to figure out the correct naming.

=== OpenBSD console ===

Add the following line to /etc/wsconsctl.conf:

    keyboard.encoding=us.metaesc

You can also set it interactively using the wsconsctl command (but the setting will be lost unless you add it to /etc/wsconsctl.conf):

    wsconsctl keyboard.encoding=us.metaesc

=== Linux console ===

If your Meta key works in the console, but Meta + Control + something
doesn't work, it may have to do with your .inputrc assuming the
console sends 8-bit characters.  Take a look at the dumpkeys man page
and friends.  You will find that for most Linux kernels, some
combinations of keys and modifiers are defined, but not for all --
because the kernel will only take around 256 different events.

=== XTerm ===

Before trying this make sure that Meta in other terms like aterm is
working.  The XTerm converts per default Metacommands. To use the
Meta-key in XTerm edit follwing:

<pre>
    ~/.inputrc
    set meta-flag on
    set convert-meta off
    set output-meta on

    ~/.Xdefaults
    XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
    XTerm*eightBitInput: false
</pre>

The metaSendsEscape flag can also be tried or toggled by holding
CTRL and pressing mouse button one and then selecting the
'meta sends escape' option in the resulting xterm menu.

=== terminals ===

It might not be obvious that when using EmacsOnTerminal, at least
certain popular DEC terminals in the absense of an Escape-key send the
escape prefix sequence on <code>C-3</code> or <code>C-[</code>.  Often
the Emacs term/ libraries configure the <code>f11</code> to be an
<code>ESC</code> too.


== source hacking for xemacs ==

Locate src/event-Xt.c, find the lines

  /* If there was no Meta key, then try using the Alt key instead.
     If there is both a Meta key and an Alt key, then the Alt key
     is not disturbed and remains an Alt key. */
  if (! meta_bit && alt_bit)
    meta_bit = alt_bit, alt_bit = 0;

.. and disable the conditional.
