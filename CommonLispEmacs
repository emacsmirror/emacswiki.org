There is not yet an implementation of Emacs in CommonLisp.
A lot of people would like to see one, however.
It is often talked about on news:comp.lang.lisp. The [http://www.mikemac.com/mikemac/McCLIM/ McCLIM] source includes the beginning of an Emacs in CL, but it's not yet usable.

There's also a page over on the Common Lisp Wiki on the subject.
CLiki:CL-Emacs

Hmm, what about HemLock, the editor distributed with CMUCL? It is
written in CommonLisp, and in the tradition of the [[WikiPedia:Lisp machine]] editor
[[ZWEI]] and the ITS implementation, TecoEmacs. Includes a news and email
client, can display to tty or X11. See
http://www.cons.org/cmucl/hemlock/. -- EricMarsden

Gilbert Baumann "ported" Hemlock to standard Common Lisp.  The
resulting project is called [http://common-lisp.net/project/phemlock Phemlock], for Portable Hemlock.

There is a lengthy discussion on news:comp.lang.lisp in a thread entitled [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.lisp/Dq52-8B3Vk4 Re: ZWEI (Re: emacs rules and vi sucks)].

Later, [[Climacs]] was created. Climacs is built on DREI, which is a combination meant to
subsume both (Portable) Hemlock and Goatee.

There is also FRED (Fred Resembles Emacs Deliberately), which is an emacs implemented in CommonLisp.  It comes with [ftp://clozure.com/pub/MCL/ Macintosh Common Lisp], which means it is limited to running on Mac OS 9 or X on PPC machines.

== Discussion ==

Having used MCL and FRED I have to say FRED really stands for FRED Requires Extensive Debugging. The keybindings are also garbage and its attempt to be compatible with mac bindings just makes things worse. --sabetts
