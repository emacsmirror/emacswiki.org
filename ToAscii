This is how you can turn a string like "Schröder" into "Schroder".
But not to "Schroeder", as German would like you to.
Nor "sœur" to "soeur". Too bad.

  "Convert STR to just ASCII characters.
All non-ASCII characters are dropped. If the character is a character
that can be split into an ASCII character and a combining diacritic
via normal form D (NFD decomposition), then that ASCII character is
used, turning é into e, for example."
  (let ((normalized (ucs-normalize-NFD-string string))
        (bytes))
    (dotimes (i (length normalized))
      (let ((c (aref normalized i)))
        (when (< c 128)
          (setq bytes (cons c bytes)))))
    (apply 'string (reverse bytes))))
