<code>iman.el</code> by YujiMinejima opens either an info format manual with InfoMode or a man page with ManMode.  Get it from the author at

: http://homepage1.nifty.com/bmonkey/emacs/elisp/iman.el

Completion is offered based on info documents in the usual info top-level "<code>dir</code>", and man pages from "<code>man -k</code>" (the "<code>apropos</code>" index of names).

If you use CompletingHelp (by the same author) possible completions presented with the "<code>?</code>" key include one-line descriptions of the documents (again from the info directory and the "apropos" lines).
