;;  Note: Occasionally I have renamed or removed an Icicles option.
;;  If you have customized such an option, then your customization
;;  will no longer have any effect.  With the exception of options
;;  `icicle-mode' and `icicle-mode-hook', library `icicles-opt.el'
;;  always contains the complete set of Icicles options.  If your
;;  custom file or init file contains an Icicles option that is not
;;  listed above, then you can remove it because it is obsolete.

(defcustom icicle-buffer-prefix-arg-filtering 'use-default
  "*Conditions that filter buffers for buffer-name candidates.
This filtering is in addition to removing the names of minibuffers.

If the value is `use-default' then use the default Icicles behavior
\(see the doc).

Otherwise, it is a list of conditions that are applied, in order,
until one matches, to filter out buffers.  If none match then no
filtering is done.

Each condition is a list of two items: (PREF-ARG-TEST BUF-TEST).

PREF-ARG-TEST is a predicate that accepts a raw prefix argument value,
such as is returned by `current-prefix-arg', as its argument.

If PREF-ARG-TEST returns non-nil then BUF-TEST is used to filter
buffers (see next).  If PREF-ARG-TEST returns nil then the next
condition is checked, and so on.  If none of the conditions match then
no filtering is done.

BUF-TEST is a predicate that accepts a buffer as argument.  If it
returns non-nil then the name of that buffer is removed as a
completion candidate.  Alternatively, BUF-TEST can be the constant
`nil', which has the same effect as applying (lambda (buf) nil) as the
filter predicate: the buffer is not removed.

As an example, this value of `icicle-buffer-prefix-arg-filtering'
provides the same behavior as value `use-default' (but it is slower):

compresses columns together.  The higher the value, the more
candidates will form well-defined columns, but the likelier that
horizontal space will be wasted between them.  The lower the value,
the more candidates will not line up in columns, but the less
horizontal space will be wasted between them.

When most candidates are almost as wide as the widest candidate, a
high value works well.  When most candidates are much shorter than the
widest candidate, a low value works well.

You can use this option to provide Icicles completion for various
modes that inherit from Comint mode or otherwise use
`comint-dynamic-complete'.

Each option list element is itself a list of two elements, (OLD NEW).
OLD specifies a function in `comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.  NEW
is a sexp that evaluates to an Icicles completion function to use
instead of OLD.

If OLD is a symbol then the value of NEW, in effect, replaces OLD in
`comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.

If OLD is a list then the value of NEW is inserted in
`comint-dynamic-complete-functions' before whichever element of OLD
occurs first in `comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.  That ensures
that NEW is invoked before OLD when attempting completion.  OLD is
invoked only if NEW cannot find a completion.

For example, this list element says to replace completion function
`foo' by completion function `my-foo': (foo 'my-foo).  And this one
says to try completing with function `mine' before `foo' or `bar':
\((foo bar) 'mine)."

The value is a list of key sequences assumed to be prefix keys.

If `icicle-complete-keys' is bound to a key on one of these prefix
keys then it does not complete that prefix key.  Instead, it acts as
though invoked at the top level.  This lets you bind key completion to
a key sequence that starts with a prefix key, so you can invoke it
from there just as if you had invoked it at top level.

Here is an example of adding two such prefix keys using Customize:

 Click [INS] to insert a new, empty entry.
 Type `M-s' in the edit field.

 Click [INS] to insert another new, empty entry.
 Type `<menu-bar> <edit>' in the edit field.

 Use the `State' menu to update the option value to reflect the edit.

This adds these two prefix keys to the option value:

 * [134217843], which is represented externally by `M-s'
 * [menu-bar edit], which represents the `Edit' menu-bar menu.

This example means that if you bind `icicle-complete-keys' to a key on
either of these prefix keys then invoking that key sequence will
complete keys at the top level - it will not complete that prefix key."

  (defcustom icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-ranges ()
    "*Non-nil means `icicle-complete-keys' includes self-inserting keys.
That means keys bound to `self-insert-command'.

For Emacs 22, this is effectively Boolean: any non-nil value allows
all self-inserting keys as candidates.

In Emacs 23+, there are thousands of self-inserting keys, so it is not
practical to allow all as candidates.  Instead, a non-nil value is a
list of character ranges of the form (MIN . MAX).  Characters in the
inclusive range MIN through MAX are possible key-completion
candidates.

For Emacs 23+, if you use a non-nil value then use only small ranges
for better performance, e.g., `((0 . 687))' covers Latin characters.

In general, leave the value as nil.  Use `C-x 8 RET' in Emacs 23+ to
insert characters by completing against their Unicode names.  With
Icicles, you can see the characters themselves in `*Completions*'
whether you use key completion or `C-x 8 RET', but in both cases you
complete against the character name.

`C-x 8 RET' is bound by default in Emacs to command `insert-char'
\(called `ucs-insert' prior to Emacs 24).  If you use my library
`ucs-cmds.el' then you might want to remap that command to command
`ucsc-insert', which is an enhancement.

For reference, below are the ranges supported by `C-x 8 RET' (Emacs
23+).  But unless you have a very powerful computer, choose only only
one or two small ranges of characters you actually might use.

BMP ranges:
 (0 . 13311)       = (#x0000 . #x33FF)
 (19904 . 19967)   = (#x4DC0 . #x4DFF)
 (40960 . 55295)   = (#xA000 . #x0D7FF)
 (64256 . 65533)   = (#xFB00 . #xFFFD)

Upper ranges:

item.  A null element (`nil') is ignored.

Several alternative entry formats are available.  When customizing,
choose an alternative in the Customize `Value Menu'.

In this description:
 SYMBOL      is a symbol identifying the menu entry.
 `menu-item' is just that text, literally.
 NAME        is a string naming the menu item or submenu.
 COMMAND     is the command to be invoked by an item.
 MENU-KEYMAP is a menu keymap or a var whose value is a menu keymap.
 KEYWORDS    is a property list of menu keywords (`:enable',
             `:visible', `:filter', `:keys', etc.).

1. Single menu item.  For a selectable item, use
   (SYMBOL menu-item NAME COMMAND . KEYWORDS).  For a non-selectable
   item such as a separator, use (SYMBOL NAME) or
   (SYMBOL menu-item NAME nil . KEYWORDS).

2. Items taken from a menu-keymap variable, such as
   `menu-bar-edit-menu'.  Just use the name of the variable (a
   symbol).  The items appear at the top level of the popup menu, not

When you hit a completion key (`TAB' or `S-TAB'), it sets the current
completion mode (prefix or apropos, respectively).  That determines
the kind of completion to be used by the per-mode cycling keys.

This option controls which completion mode to use if you cycle using a
per-mode key (e.g. `down') *before* hitting a completion key.

 - `prefix'  means cycle prefix completions
 - `apropos' means cycle apropos completions
 - Any other non-nil value means cycle inputs from the input history
 - nil means do not cycle - you must first hit a completion key

The per-mode cycling keys are the values of
`icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys' (backward) and
`icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys' (forward).  By default, these are keys
`up' and `down' as well as the mouse wheel.

For example, if the value is `prefix' (the default) then you can
immediately cycle prefix completions using `up', `down', or the mouse
wheel, without first hitting `TAB'.

Once you have used `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse the
history is using `M-p' and `M-n' (they always traverse the history).

This option affects only cycling with the per-mode keys.  You can
always use the mode-specific cycling keys instead to cycle according
to a particular mode.  The mode-specific keys are (by default):

 - `end'  and `home'  for prefix completion
 - `next' and `prior' for apropos completion

\(By default there is no conflict between the cycling keys that are
mode-specific and those that are per-mode.  But if you customize them
in such a way that you set a key to both, the mode-specific use takes
priority.)

After you change the value of this option, toggle Icicle mode off,
then on again, for the change to take effect in the same session."

These are the possible option values:

  nil               - Do not insert default value or add it to prompt.
  t                 - Add default value to `completing-read' prompt.
                      Do not insert it.
  `insert-start'    - Insert default value and leave cursor at start.
  `insert-end'      - Insert default value and leave cursor at end.
  `preselect-start' - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at beginning.
  `preselect-end'   - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at end.

This option controls how a non-nil default-value argument to functions
such as `completing-read', `read-file-name', `read-from-minibuffer',
and `read-string' is handled.

When it is non-nil and non-t, and the initial-input argument is nil or
\"\", the default value can be inserted into the minibuffer as the
initial input.

For `completing-read' and `read-file-name', if the option value is `t'
then the default value is normally added to the prompt as a hint.
However, for `read-file-name', if `insert-default-directory' is
non-nil, then to avoid duplication:

* If the default value is the same as `default-directory' it is not
  added to the prompt.

* If the default value is added to the prompt it is first made
  relative to `default-directory'.

Adding the default value to the prompt corresponds to the more or less
conventional behavior of vanilla Emacs.  But vanilla Emacs does not do
this systematically for `completing-read' (or for any of the
input-reading functions).  Instead, it hard-codes default values into
prompts in the commands that call these functions.

By design, Icicles commands never add the default value to the prompt
themselves.  This includes Icicles versions of standard commands that
might do so.  Icicles instead tries to give users the choice, using
option `icicle-default-value'.

Functions `completing-read', `read-file-name', and `read-string' are
the only input-reading functions for which Icicles adds the default
value to the prompt (for option value `t').  Other such functions,
such as `read-from-minibuffer', treat empty input (just `RET')
specially - see their doc for details.

Inserting the default value in the minibuffer as the initial input has
the advantage of not requiring you to use `M-n' to retrieve it.  It
has the disadvantage of making you use `M-k' (or do something else) to
get rid of the default value in the minibuffer if you do not want to
use or edit it.

If you often want to use or edit the default value, then set
`icicle-default-value' to non-nil and non-t.  If you rarely do so,
then set it to nil or t.

If the default value is inserted in the minibuffer, the value of this
option also determines whether or not the inserted text is
preselected, and where the cursor is left: at the beginning or end of
the text.

Preselection can be useful in Delete Selection mode or PC Selection
mode.  It makes it easy to replace the value by typing characters, or
delete it by hitting `C-d' or `DEL' (backspace).  However, all of the
initial input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL'.  That is
inconvenient if you want to keep most of it and edit it only slightly.

My own preference for the option value is `insert-end', but the
default value is `t', which is closest to what vanilla Emacs does."

You can use `\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[icicle-goto/kill-failed-input]' \
to go to the start of the highlighted part.
Repeat to kill it.

This highlighting can have a negative impact on performance, because
it can mean recomputing completion candidates multiple times, in order
to determine the longest part that completes.  For this reason, you
can fine tune when you want this highlighting to occur.  The values of
this option and options
`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay' and
`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold' determine when
the highlighting can take place.

In particular, highlighting the non-matching part of remote file names
can be slow.  Two values of this option allow remote file name
highlighting: `always' and `explicit-remote'.  The other values do not
highlight remote file names.  You probably do not want to use a value
of `always'.

If the value is nil, then highlighting never occurs.  If the value is
`explicit-strict', `explicit', or `explicit-remote', then highlighting
occurs only upon demand: when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to request
completion.  If the value is `implicit-strict', `implicit', or
`always', then highlighting occurs also when you update your input
during incremental completion.

If the value is `implicit-strict' or `implicit', then highlighting
occurs not only upon demand but also during incremental completion if
`icicle-incremental-completion' is non-nil.  Remember that you can
cycle incremental completion, using `C-#' in the minibuffer.

I use a value of `implicit' myself, but the default value is
`implicit-strict' because, depending on your setup and use cases,
`implicit' can impact performance for file-name completion (which is
lax, not strict).  I suggest you try `implicit' to see - this feature
is especially useful for file names.

Summary of choices for when to highlight:

nil               Never
`explicit-strict' When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB' for strict completion
`explicit'        When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB'
`explicit-remote' When you hit `TAB'/`S-TAB', including remote files
`implicit-strict' During strict completion
`implicit'        During lax or strict completion
`always'          Always, even for names of remote files

After highlighting, you can use `C-M-l' to move the cursor to the
start of the mismatch, for editing there.  You can use a second
`C-M-l' to kill (delete) the mismatch up to the next input line (if
any).  You can repeat `C-M-l' to kill additional input lines.

  "*String joining items in a completion that is a list of strings.
When a completion candidate is a list of strings, this string is used
to join the strings in the list, for display and matching purposes.
When completing input, you type regexps that match the strings,
separating them pairwise by the value of `icicle-list-join-string'.
Actually, what you enter is interpreted as a single regexp to be
matched against the joined strings.  Typically, the candidate list
contains two strings: a name and its doc string.

A good value for this option is a string that:
 1) does not normally occur in doc strings,
 2) visually separates the two strings it joins, and
 3) is not too difficult or too long to type.

The default value is \"^G\^J\", that is, control-g followed by
control-j (newline):
 1) ^G does not normally occur in doc strings
 2) a newline visually separates the multiple component strings, which
    helps readability in buffer `*Completions*'
 3) you can type the value using `C-q C-g C-q C-j'.

For readability (in Emacs 22 and later), the default value has a
`display' property that makes it appear as simply a newline in
`*Completions*' - the `^G' is hidden.  you can also make the default
value appear this way in your minibuffer input also, by using \
`\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[icicle-insert-list-join-string].'

If you like the default value of `^G^J', but you prefer that the `^G'
not be hidden, then just customize this option.  In Customize, use
`Show initial Lisp expression' after clicking the `State' button, to
be able to edit the default value.  Remove the `set-text-properties'

Also, some commands, such as `icicle-locate-file', use a prefix arg to

ignore this option.

A typical example of showing multi-completions is adding buffer names
to candidates to show which buffer they are associated with.  Some
commands, such as `icicle-search', append the name of the associated
buffer, highlighted, to the normal completion candidate.  This lets
you easily see which buffer the candidate applies to.  Also, the
buffer name is part of the candidate, so you can match against it.

Note: Even when the option value is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2' and
so on to see information about a candidate.  This information
typically includes whatever a non-nil value of the option would have

  "*Predicate or predicates for sorting (comparing) two items.
Used in particular to sort completion candidates.  In that case, this
determines the order of candidates when cycling and their order in
buffer `*Completions*'.

You can cycle completion sort orders at any time using `C-,' in the
minibuffer.

Although this is a user option, it may be changed by program
locally, for use in particular contexts.  In particular, you can bind
this to nil in an Emacs-Lisp function, to inhibit sorting in that
context.

Various sorting commands change the value of this option dynamically
\(but they do not save the changed value).

The value must be one of the following:

* nil, meaning do not sort

* a predicate that takes two items as args

* a list of the form ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED), where each PRED and
  FINAL-PRED are binary predicates

If the value is a non-empty list, then each PRED is tried in turn
until one returns a non-nil value.  In that case, the result is the
car of that value.  If no non-nil value is returned by any PRED, then
FINAL-PRED is used and its value is the result.

Each PRED should return `(t)' for true, `(nil)' for false, or nil for
undecided.  A nil value means that the next PRED decides (or
FINAL-PRED, if there is no next PRED).

Thus, a PRED is a special kind of predicate that indicates either a
boolean value (as a singleton list) or \"I cannot decide - let the
next guy else decide\".  (Essentially, each PRED is a hook function
that is run using `run-hook-with-args-until-success'.)

Examples:

 nil           - No sorting.

 string-lessp  - Single predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

 ((p1 p2))     - Two predicates `p1' and `p2', which each return
                 (t) for true, (nil) for false, or nil for undecided.

 ((p1 p2) string-lessp)
               - Same as previous, except if both `p1' and `p2' return
                 nil, then the return value of `string-lessp' is used.

Note that these two values are generally equivalent, in terms of their
effect (*):

 ((p1 p2))
 ((p1) p2-plain) where p2-plain is (icicle-make-plain-predicate p2)

Likewise, these three values generally act equivalently:

 ((p1))
 (() p1-plain)
 p1-plain        where p1-plain is (icicle-make-plain-predicate p1)

The PRED form lets you easily combine predicates: use `p1' unless it
cannot decide, in which case try `p2', and so on.  The value ((p2 p1))
tries the predicates in the opposite order: first `p2', then `p1' if
`p2' returns nil.

Using a single predicate or FINAL-PRED makes it easy to reuse an
existing predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

You can also convert a PRED-type predicate (which returns (t), (nil),
or nil) into an ordinary predicate, by using function
`icicle-make-plain-predicate'.  That lets you reuse elsewhere, as
ordinary predicates, any PRED-type predicates you define.

Note: As a convention, predefined Icicles PRED-type predicate names
have the suffix `-cp' (for \"component predicate\") instead of `-p'."

2. `basic'
3. `fuzzy'   (provided you have library `fuzzy-match.el')
4. `swank'   (provided you have library `el-swank-fuzzy.el')

1. Vanilla completion respects option `completion-styles' (new in
Emacs 23), so that `TAB' behaves similarly in Icicles to what it does
in vanilla Emacs.  The vanilla method also completes environment
variables during file-name completion and in shell commands.  The
non-vanilla methods do not complete environment variables, but the
variables are expanded to their values when you hit `RET'.

2. Basic completion means ordinary prefix completion. It is the
`basic' completion style of Emacs 23 or later, and it is essentially
the completion style prior to Emacs 23 (Emacs 22 completion was
slightly different - see Emacs 23 option `custom-styles' for more
info).

3. Fuzzy-match completion is a form of prefix completion in which
matching finds the candidates that have the most characters in common
with your input, in the same order, and with a minimum of non-matching
characters.  It can skip over non-matching characters, as long as the
number of characters skipped in the candidate is less that those
following them that match.  After the matching candidates are found,
they are sorted by skip length and then candidate length.

Fuzzy-match completion is described in detail in the commentary of
library `fuzzy-match.el'.  There is no fuzzy-match completion of file
names - fuzzy-match completion is the same as basic for file names.
Fuzzy-match completion is always case-sensitive.

4. Swank completion in Icicles is the same as fuzzy-match completion,
except regarding symbols.  That is, swank completion per se applies
only to symbols.  Symbols are completed using the algorithm of library
`el-swank-fuzzy.el'.

Icicles options `icicle-swank-timeout' and
`icicle-swank-prefix-length' give you some control over the behavior.
When the `TAB' completion method is `swank', you can use `C-x 1'
\(`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-timeout+') and `C-x 2'
\(`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+') in the minibuffer to
increment these options on the fly using the arrow keys `up' and
`down'.

Swank symbol completion uses heuristics that relate to supposedly
typical patterns found in symbol names.  It also uses a timeout that
can limit the number of matches.  It is generally quite a bit slower
than fuzzy-match completion, and it sometimes does not provide all
candidates that you might think should match, even when all of your
input is a prefix (or even when it is already complete!).  If swank
completion produces no match when you think it should, remember that
you can use `\\[icicle-next-TAB-completion-method]' on the fly to \
change the completion method.

If you do not customize `icicle-TAB-completion-methods', then the
default value (that is, the available `TAB' completion methods) will
reflect your current Emacs version and whether you have loaded
libraries `fuzzy-match.el' and `el-swank-fuzzy.el'.

By default, `TAB' is the key for this completion. The actual keys
used are the value of option `icicle-prefix-complete-keys'.

NOTE: This option has no effect on some Icicles commands, in
particular commands that allow for multi-completion input, such as
`icicle-buffer' and `icicle-file'.

See also options `icicle-TAB-completion-methods-per-command'
`icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist'."

Each command is advised so that when invoked only the specified TAB
completion methods are available for it when you use `C-('.  (This

This option gives you greater control over which completion methods

NOTE: If you remove an entry from this list, that does NOT remove the

A value of nil turns off all handling of remote file names by Tramp,

The testing due to a non-nil value takes a little time, but the test
result saves time with Tramp handling, and it is used to avoid some
other costly operations when a file is determined to be remote.  These
operations are (a) incremental completion and (b) highlighting of the
part of your current input that does not complete.

Use a nil value only when you are sure that the file names you are
completing are local.  The effect will be a slight speed increase for
operations (a) and (b) for local files.

In addition, a nil value has the effect of ignoring the restriction of
input mismatch highlighting to strict completion.  That is, it treats
an `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure' value of
`explicit-strict' or `implicit-strict' as if it were `implicit'.  The
assumption here is that you use these highlighting values only to
avoid the cost of remote file name completion.

  "*List of top-level key bindings in Icicle mode.
Each list element is of custom type `icicle-key-definition' and has
the form (KEY COMMAND CONDITION).

KEY is either a key sequence (string or vector) to bind COMMAND to or
a command to remap to COMMAND.
COMMAND is bound according to the value of KEY, unless the result of
evaluating CONDITION is nil.

In Customize, to specify a key sequence, choose `Key' in the `Value
Menu', then enter a key description such as that returned by `C-h k'.
For convenience, you can insert each key in the key description by
hitting `C-q' then the key.  For example, to enter the key description
`C-c M-k' you can use `C-q C-c C-q M-k'.

If you customize this option then you must exit and re-enter Icicle
mode to ensure that the change takes effect.  This is really necessary
only if your changes would undefine a key.

For this option to have an effect upon startup, it must be set before
you enter Icicle mode.  This means that you must ensure that the code
that sets it is invoked before you enter Icicle mode.  If you use
Customize to change this option, then ensure that the code inserted by
Customize into your `user-init-file' or your `custom-file' is invoked
before you enter Icicle mode.

However, just because a function is defined at runtime does not mean

accepts no arguments, so applying it to a buffer name raises an error.

send them in, using `\\[icicle-send-bug-report]'.  The initial list

completion in contexts where it makes little sense for users to act on
the same candidate more than once.  That way, users cannot choose it
again, and they are not distracted seeing it as a candidate.

See also non-option variable `icicle-use-candidates-only-once-alt-p'.

Remember that you can use multi-command `icicle-toggle-option' anytime
\(`M-i M-i' during completion) to toggle an option value."

Because file names, in particular, can contain spaces, some people
prefer such a key sequence to be non-printable, such as `M-SPC'.  This
is the default value in Icicles.

But because the spacebar is such a convenient key to hit, other people
prefer to use `SPC' for word completion, and to insert a space some
other way.  The usual way to do that is via `C-q SPC', but command
`icicle-insert-a-space' is provided for convenience.  You can bind
this to `M-SPC', for instance, in `minibuffer-local-completion-map',
`minibuffer-local-completion-map', and

Some commands might override a string value with different text.  This

swatch text is always the color's RGB code.
