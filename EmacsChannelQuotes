<e1f`> that's b/c it's an interpreted language
<yrk> TerryP: it's very hardware dependant
<TerryP> yrk: so true
<TerryP> and it's absolutely not pointer-safe, unless you use a wrapper
<TerryP> :)
<yrk> it has some of the most beutiful GUIs I've ever seen
<TerryP> it's very strict about OOP, once you create something in it, it will inherit from you
<franl> It's also got support for spawning child processes.
<TerryP> it's hard/impossible to maintain though
<TerryP> franl: controlling the child-processes is hard though
<yrk> the deeper the indentation the better
