: In the GNU/Linux world there are two major text editing programs: the
minimalist vi (known in some implementations as elvis) and the
maximalist emacs. I use emacs, which might be thought of as a
thermonuclear word processor. It was created by RichardStallman;
enough said. It is written in Lisp, which is the only computer
language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits
straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no
underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of
Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the
ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate
memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity
on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are
a professional writer -- i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry
about how your words are formatted and printed -- emacs outshines all
other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday
sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply
makes everything else vanish. -- Neal Stephenson, ''In the Beginning was the Command Line'' (1998) [http://adam.shand.net/iki/library/in_the_beginning_was_the_command_line/]
