== Progressive Completion ==

Perhaps the best way to explain this feature is to use a familiar analogy.
Unix or GNU/Linux command `grep' takes a regular-expression ([[regexp]])
argument, and matches it against lines in files.  A common idiom
that people use is to chain, or cascade, multiple calls to `grep',
using ''the output of one as the input to the next''.  For example:

  grep plant *.txt | grep food | grep mineral

The output of the search for "##plant##" is used as the input for the
search for "##food##", and the output of that search serves as the
input for the search for "##mineral##".  The order of the three
component searches can make a difference in terms of performance,
but not in terms of the result, which is always the set of lines
in files ##*.txt## that match "##plant##" '''''and''''' "##food##" '''''and''''' "##mineral##", in any
order. Each of the `grep' operations defines a set of matches,
and the chain of `grep' operations effects the ''intersection'' of
those sets.

Of course, you could try to accomplish the same thing with a
single call to `grep' using a complex regexp.  ''But why would you?''  

Moreover, it is in fact impossible to express such an unordered
set intersection using a single regexp.  On their own, regular
expressions cannot express set intersection (conjunction) or
complementing (negation).  (However, most `grep' programs provide
a way to obtain the lines that do ''not'' match a regexp.)

The same idea of combining multiple regexp matches is behind the '''Icicles''' feature of '''[::progressive completion]''': instead of trying to come up with a single complex regexp
that does what you want, try getting there a step at a time:

# Match an input regexp against the set of all possible
    completions.

# Narrow the set of matched candidates by matching them against
    another input regexp (or by filtering them with a predicate).

# Narrow those results down by matching them against a third
    input regexp (or by filtering them with another predicate).

# ... And so on.













[:Regexps]
=== `M-*' and `S-SPC': Matching Additional Regexps ===

During [[completion]], '''`M-*'''' is bound in the [[minibuffer]] to [[command]]
'''`icicle-narrow-candidates'''', which prompts for a new regexp and
matches it against the current set of completion candidates.

As is often the case in '''Icicles''', you can think of the '''`*'''' in `M-*'
as mnemonic for Boolean multiplication, that is, AND, or set
intersection.  (It is more common and handier to use `S-SPC' than
`M-*' -- see [[#SuccessiveApproximation|Successive Approximation]].)

For example, suppose that you want to know about an Emacs function that deletes the character to the left of [[point]] (that is,
backward).  You do not recall if it is `delete-character-back',
`delete-backward-char', `character-delete-backward', or whatever.
You take a guess that the name contains `delete', `char', and `back'.

# `C-h f char S-TAB' displays function names that contain "'''##char##'''".

# `##M-* delete##' narrows that set of function names to those that ''also''
contain "'''##delete##'''".

# `##M-* back##' narrows the set of matching names further, to
those that ''also'' contain "'''##back##'''".

This displays a list of functions like this in `*Completions*' (your
list might be somewhat different):

[new]

     backward-delete-char             backward-delete-char-untabify
     delete-backward-char             icicle-backward-delete-char-untabify
     icicle-delete-backward-char      quail-conversion-backward-delete-char

[new]

Then, of course, you can pick one (or you can use `C-M-next'
repeatedly to view the [[doc string]] of each of these functions in turn -- see [[Icicles - Help on Candidates]]).

You get the idea.  This feature is both very simple to use and
very useful.  It's easy to appreciate using multiple simple
matching steps (regexp or not) instead of a single regexp.  ''Try it
once, and you'll be hooked.''









[:SuccessiveApproximation]
=== Successive Approximation... ===

You can use as many invocations of `M-*' (and of `##M-&##', described
in the next section) as you like, in
any order.  It works with both [[prefix completion]] and [[apropos completion]].

You can, for instance, first use `TAB' to require the target to start with some
string, and then use `M-*' to specify other patterns that parts of
it must also match.  However, it of course makes no sense to
use `TAB' instead of `S-TAB' ''after'' you use `M-*': once you've said
that the target must start with "##fo##" there is no sense saying that
it also starts with "##ti##"! 

As a shortcut, instead of using `S-TAB'
followed by `M-*', you can use '''`S-SPC'''' (command
'''`icicle-apropos-complete-and-narrow'''') to do the same thing.    You can thus use only `S-SPC', any number of
times, to choose a candidate by narrowing down the matches.

I call this process of completion by
successive approximation, or progressively narrowing the candidate
set, "'''progressive completion'''".  If the name "incremental completion" (= icompletion)
were not already taken to mean incremental completion ''help''
(which actually performs ''no'' completion), then that might be a good name for
this.  This might also be called "stepped", "cascaded", or
"piecewise" completion.

Another possible name for it would be "multiple completion", but I
use that to stand for simultaneous (parallel) completion of
multiple parts of a compound target, which is something different
(see [[Icicles - Multi-Completions]]).  Progressive completion is a set of mini-completions that
are wired in series, not in parallel.

Note that when you use `M-*' or `S-SPC' in the minibuffer, it calls
`completing-read', which creates a ''recursive minibuffer''.  That is,
the minibuffer depth is increased.    (This is not the case
for `##M-&##', however.)  In vanilla Emacs, there is no indicator
of the current minibuffer depth, and this can sometimes be
disorienting.  Each time you use `M-*' or `S-SPC' you push down one level of
minibuffer recursion (that is, minibuffer depth is incremented).
Each time you use, say, `C-g', you pop up one level of minibuffer
recursion (that is, minibuffer depth is decremented).

If you use library ##mb-depth.el##, which is included with Emacs 23
and which also works with Emacs 22, ''Icicle'' mode takes advantage of
this library by indicating the current depth in the minibuffer.  I
recommend you also use my library <tt>[[mb-depth+.el]]</tt>, which lets you
customize the form and face of the depth indicator.  See MinibufferDepthIndicator.

If you use my library '''<tt>[[oneonone.el]]</tt>''', then you get visual
feedback on the current minibuffer depth.  '''OneOnOneEmacs''' gives you a
standalone minibuffer frame, and it changes the background hue
(color) of that frame slightly with each change in minibuffer
depth.  This is especially helpful with '''Icicles''', where use of
`M-*' or `S-SPC' is common.  See [[Dedicated Minibuffer Frame]].

There is a slight difference in behavior between
'''Icicles''' commands and some other Emacs commands when you accept
input after `M-*' or `S-SPC'.  When possible, '''Icicles''' accepts your input and
passes it immediately to the top level, bypassing any intermediate
recursive minibuffer levels that are waiting for input.  However,
Emacs commands that are defined with `interactive' specs, such as
##(interactive "fFile:")##, do not use `completing-read' or
`read-file-name', so there is no way for '''Icicles''' to take this
shortcut with them.  In that case, you will simply need to hit
`RET' again to accept your input at each recursive minibuffer
level, until you get back to the top level.  Sorry for this
inconvenience!  If you are an EmacsLisp programmer, note that
this is one reason to use `completing-read' and `read-file-name'
when you write commands that use completion.

Note: If you use progressive completion with file names in Emacs
20 or 21, `M-*' or `S-SPC' calls `completing-read', not `read-file-name'.
This is because `read-file-name' does not accept a ##PREDICATE##
argument before Emacs 22.  The effect is that instead of there
being a default directory for completion, the current directory at
the time you hit `M-*' or `S-SPC' is tacked onto each file name, to become
part of the completion candidates themselves.  Yes, this is a hack.
It works, but be aware of the behavior.

Progressive completion lets you match multiple regexps, some of
which could of course be literal substrings, with their regexp
special characters, if any, escaped.  If you need to match such
substrings at particular locations in the target completion
candidate, then progressive completion will not do the job -- it
matches its component regexps independently.  You can regexp-quote
(escape) parts or all of your input using '''`##M-%##''''
(`icicle-regexp-quote-input').
See [[Icicles - Special Characters in Input Patterns#Escaping|Escaping Special Characters]].













[:Predicates]
=== `M-&': Satisfying Additional Predicates ===

If you use '''Icicles''', then you will use `M-*' or `S-SPC' very often.  This
section describes a seldom-used feature that can be useful in
certain contexts.  If you are new to '''Icicles''' or you are unfamiliar
with EmacsLisp, then you might want to just ''skim this section'' or
skip it and come back to it later.

Just as you can use `M-*' or `S-SPC' to narrow the set of candidates by
matching an additional regexp, so you can use '''`##M-&##'''' (bound to
'''`icicle-narrow-candidates-with-predicate'''') to narrow by satisfying
an additional predicate.  The idea is the same; the only
difference is that, instead of typing a regexp to match, you type
a predicate to satisfy.

The predicate is a Boolean function of a single completion
candidate.  At the prompt, you enter its name or its [[LambdaExpression | lambda-expression]]
definition (anonymous function).  The predicate is used the same
way as the ##PREDICATE## argument to `completing-read' and
`read-file-name'.  This means that the candidate argument to the
predicate is whatever is used in the original call to
`completing-read' or `read-file-name'; it is not just a string
such as you see in buffer `*Completions*'.  To provide an appropriate
predicate, you must be familiar with the kind of candidate
expected by the [[command]] you invoked before just before `##M-&##'.

For example:

* Command `describe-function' (`C-h f') uses candidates that are
[[symbol]]s.  An appropriate predicate would accept a symbol as
argument.

* Command `icicle-search' (`##C-c `##') uses candidates that have this
form: ##(CONTEXT . MARKER)##, where ##CONTEXT## is a string, the search
hit (search context), and ##MARKER## is a [[buffer]] [[marker]] that locates
the ##CONTEXT##.  An appropriate predicate would accept such a
candidate as argument.

Although entering a lambda expression at a prompt might not seem
too convenient, you can at least retrieve previously entered
predicates (using `M-p' and so on).  

You can also use '''`##C-M-&##'''' (bound to
'''`icicle-save-predicate-to-variable'''') at any time during completion to save the
current predicate as a string-valued variable.  By default, the
variable is `icicle-input-string'.  You can then retrieve the
saved string later, using `##C-=##' at the prompt for `##M-&##'.  The
current predicate is what is saved.  You can build up a complex
predicate, and then save it for later use.

The inconvenience of typing an 
EmacsLisp [[sexp]] must be balanced against the power of applying
predicates on the fly.  Whereas regexp matching is purely
syntactic, with a predicate you can perform ''semantic'' tests.
During search, for instance, you can look not only for a syntax
match; you can look for matching search candidates that also
belong to a particular class of objects (e.g. function, [[variable]],
type) or that satisfy some other semantic property.
