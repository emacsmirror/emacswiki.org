I am the author of  Orgmode's OpenDocumentText Exporter.   I no longer contribute to Emacs or participate actively in the mailing lists.  However, I continue to improve the exporter in my own personal repository.  See [[http://cauvery.nfshost.com/wiki.pl/ODT_Exporter ODT Expoter]] for more information.  If you want to report a bug in the exporter or request a specific feature, don't hesitate to leave a note here.  I will try my best to help you.  That said, it is very likely that you will find an answer to your question in [[http://cauvery.nfshost.com/wiki.pl/ODT_Exporter_FAQ List of FAQs]]

As a [[Friend of Emacs]], I run a gifting program.  See [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/170713 Personal gift - INR 10,000  (Ten Thousand) - to new contributors]] for more information.

* [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24434854/emacs-org-odt-export-as-odf-and-open-odt-outside-emacs How do I open an exported ODT file using LibreOffice]]?
** Assuming that your are on a Linux system, use this ##(setcdr (assq 'system org-file-apps-defaults-gnu ) "xdg-open %s")##.  

* Is it possible to modify exporter to use superscripts as references like[sup]1[/sup] that rather than like this[1]?
** See [[http://cauvery.nfshost.com/wiki.pl/ODT_Exporter_FAQ List of FAQs]].  Is that what you are looking for? Please acknowledge.
*** I think that is what I'm looking for, but that page says, ##"Citation references use a style named OrgCite. Modify this style to use Subscript. Then follow the procedure outline under"##, but I do not see ##"OrgCite"## under the ##"Styles and Formatting"## menu. 

**** Check your ##*Messages*## buffer and see where from the Styles file is picked from.  It should come from the ELPA directory for ##org-odt##.  If the style file is coming from wrong directory, then you need to fix up ##org-odt-data-dir## (as outlined in my personal wiki page).  
***** Got it. I was using a stale styles.xml, not your version, hence the missing ##OrgCite##. THANK YOU!
