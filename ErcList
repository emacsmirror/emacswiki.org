erc-list.el implements a channel list view mode buffer.

Use the /LIST command or invoke it interactively with M-x erc-chanlist RET to get a nicely sorted
channel list in a separate buffer.

=== Some keybindings ===

If point is at a channel name (at the # sign), you can join that channel by pressing `j' or `C-c C-j'. 
Use `s' to sort alphabetically or according to the number of users in a channel.
Type `t' to toggle display of details about each channel.
Type `q' to hide the window and restore previous window configuration again.
