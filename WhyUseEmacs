: ''Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.'' -- the EmacsManual

What does this mean? [[Extensible]] refers to Emacs being built upon a core set of routines hard-coded in C, which are then extended using a language called EmacsLisp. For this reason, Emacs remains the most powerful editor ever made - you can customize it to suit your needs perfectly. If there isn't a feature, just add it! Emacs can do anything that can be coded in EmacsLisp, and that is a heck of a lot of things. 

Here is a short list of Emacs features.
