EmacsVersor (https://github.com/hillwithsmallfields/emacs-versor or older versions at http://emacs-versor.sourceforge.net/) provides:

* A block (or region) cursor, with motion and text selection by semantically significant units e.g. statements, statement parts, sentences, phrases, table rows and cells

* Editing in terms of these (e.g. "Make the selected code conditional" or "Delete the selected text")

* Easy access to these through flexible, dynamic, rebinding of the arrow keys and others, with easy ways to navigate the space of possible navigation spaces

* High-level editing operations such as:

** Converting an expression to a local variable initialized to that value

** Converting a block of code to a procedure/function, working out automatically what parameters are required 

* Means to access these (and other) navigation and editing commands through a narrow-channel interface such as FootSwitches or GamePad (suitable for disability access, including RepeatedStrainInjury)

* VoiceRecognition for use with emacs-vr-mode
