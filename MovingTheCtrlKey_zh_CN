[[en:MovingTheCtrlKey]]
This page explains how to move the Control key. Some users find that this can help to avoid "Emacs pinky" (RepeatedStrainInjury).

First several sections are devoted for Linux solutions. Note that the keyboard mappings are separate for X (graphical) and for virtual consoles. (Sidenote: This problem may be alleviated soon as Debian's <code>/etc/default/keyboard</code> file appears designed to work for both virtual consoles and X.)

== Introduction ==
For some, swapping Control and CapsLock is very important; the virtually useless CapsLock is far easier to press Control, crucial to Emacs yet really awkwardly located.

== Gnome Desktop Environment ==

Recent versions of the Gnome desktop have a Keyboard Preferences dialog that allows you to configure the Ctrl key position.  On Ubuntu this is found under System -> Preferences -> Keyboard.  Under the "Layout Options" tab choose "Ctrl key position" and it gives you a number of choices.

Under Gnome Shell, the same settings can be found under System Settings -> Keyboard Layout.  Choose the Layouts tab, then click on "Options...".  Expand the "Ctrl key position" section and you'll see a similar list of of options.

Keyboard Preferences

=== GNome Shell 3.8 ===
In GNome Shell 3.8 this option is moved to Tweek Tool

[[image:Gnome_Tweek_Tool_Icon.png|Gnome Tweek Tool Icon]]

Then go to the "Typing" area an search for "Ctrl key position" and select "Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock"

[[image:Gnome_Tweek_Typing_Area.png|Gnome Tweek Typing Area]]

[[image:Gnome_Tweek_Tool_Ctrl_Position.png|Gnome Tweek Tool Ctrl Position]]

== KDE Desktop Environment ==

In KDE 4.x there's a "Keyboard Layout" dialog in the Systems settings that allow you to modify the Caps Lock behavior. First be sure to allow KDE to control keyboard layouts. Do this by selecting "Enable keyboard layouts" here:

[[image:KDEKeyboardPreferences.png|KDE Keyboard Layout]]

Then turn on the desired options and press the apply button:

[[image:KDEKeyboardAdvancedOptions.png|KDE Keyboard Layout Advanced Options]]


== X (using xmodmap) ==
In the X Windowing System you can use <code>xmodmap(1)</code> to change the keymaping.  Some desktop environments, like Gnome and KDE, which use X, have specialized preference menus to make this easier.  The advantage of using <code>xmodmap</code> is that it will work with any desktop or Window Manager.

See the man page command [http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/xmodmap.1.html xmodmap(1x)] for more information.  I swap their functions throughout my environment, not just for Emacs.

On Unix-like systems, I have a ~/.xmodmap file:
<pre>
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
</pre>

which is sourced from my ~/.xsession with the line:
<pre>
xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
</pre>


== X (using xkb) ==
In the X Window System, you can also swap Control and Caps Lock with the xkb option <code>ctrl:swapcaps</code>.  If you don't ever need Caps Lock you can instead of swapping the two set Caps Lock to be another Control. This is done with <code>ctrl:nocaps</code>. Use one of these from command line:
<pre>
  setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps     # Swap Left Control and Caps Lock
  setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps       # Make Caps Lock a Control key
</pre>

Note that the above will change your keyboard layout to a us keyboard layout. If it is not a US keyboard layout, you need to add a switch with your layout, like:

<pre>
  setxkbmap -layout gb -option ctrl:nocaps # Caps Lock is Control on a GB keyboard
</pre>

If you don't know your keyboard layout name, I think it is always the second value inside the xkb_symbols include line if you setxkbmap -print, so this command should preserve it for you:
<pre>
  setxkbmap -layout "$(setxkbmap -print | awk -F + '/xkb_symbols/ {print $2}')" -option ctrl:nocaps
</pre>

You can put this command in your <code>~/.xsession</code>, <code>~/.gnomerc</code> or whatever.  If you can edit the X configuration file, you might do it system-wide:
<pre>
  Section "InputDevice"
    Driver "keyboard"
    Option "XkbRules" [...]
    Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:nocaps"
</pre>

If above setting does not work, try this one(nowadays Xorg prefers):
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier            "Keyboard Setting"
    MatchIsKeyboard       "yes"
    Option                "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"
EndSection

</pre>

In Fedora 15 you can also add a file <code>~/.Xkbmap</code> that contains command line arguments to <code>setxkbmap</code>. These will be used when you next log in.

<pre>
-option ctrl:swapcaps
</pre>

The CapsKey page has an example of moving Ctrl to Caps.

== Virtual consoles ==

A virtual console is NOT an <code>[agkux]term</code> inside of X.  It is the white-on-black text-only mode that scares some people who have been traumatized by Microsoft's COMMAND.COM shell.  If you do not use virtual consoles, there is no reason for you to read this section.

=== Generic GNU/Linux Virtual Console (any distribution) ===

''Note: while these instructions should work under any distribution of GNU/Linux, you may wish to use a distribution-specific method which may be simpler.''

Press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to enter the first virtual console.

Now run:

 $ sudo dumpkeys | head -1 > /usr/share/keymaps/Caps2Ctrl.map

Then add the following lines to that file:

 keycode 58 = Control #This makes Caps act as Ctrl
 # keycode 29 = Caps_Lock #This makes Ctrl act as Caps
 # alt_is_meta #This fixes the Alt key

Then run loadkeys on that file:

 $ sudo loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/Caps2Ctrl.map

To revert run:

 $ sudo loadkeys -d #load default keymap file

For more extensive editing try:

 $ dumpkeys > my_keymap
 $ cp my_keymap trial_keymap
 $ edit trial_keymap
 $ sudo loadkeys trial_keymap

 $ man keymaps

  It should be noted that using numeric notation for the
  keysyms is highly unportable as the key action numbers
  To find out what keysyms there are available  for  use
  in keymaps files, use the command

        dumpkeys --long-info

  Unfortunately,  there  is  currently no description of
  what each symbol does. It has to be guessed  from  the
  name or figured out from the kernel sources.

=== On Debian GNU/Linux (console-setup method, newer) ===

To make CAPS LOCK another control key, edit the file '''/etc/default/keyboard''' and change the line which reads

 XKBOPTIONS=""

to

 XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"		# Some people prefer "ctrl:swapcaps"

To make the change effective:

 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh console-setup

=== On Debian GNU/Linux (console-tools method, older) ===

To make Caps Lock another control, add/uncomment the following line in <code>/etc/console-tools/remap</code>

 s/keycode  58 = Caps_Lock/keycode  58 = Control/;

To make the change effective:

 $ sudo invoke-rc.d console-screen.sh restart

=== On Ubuntu GNU/Linux virtual console ===

Ubuntu Maverick

Click on System > Preferences > Keyboard

This will open the Keyboard preferences. In "Layout" tab find "options..." then locate "Ctrl key position"

select "Swap Ctrl and CapsLock"

or also you can select "Make CapsLock an additional Ctrl"

this also work for virtual consoles

1. Edit /etc/default/console-setup and add an X11 style caps lock modification:

 $ diff -U0 /etc/default/{console-setup.orig,console-setup}
 --- /etc/default/console-setup.orig     2009-02-09 03:05:27.000000000 -0500
 +++ /etc/default/console-setup  2009-02-09 04:11:20.000000000 -0500
 @@ -40 +40 @@
 -XKBOPTIONS=""
 +XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:swapcaps"

you can do "ctrl:nocaps" instead if you want to two control keys.

2. Trick dpkg into integrating your changes:

 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

and choose all the defaults.

(The above is a brief version of a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/console-tools/+bug/140786/comments/7 bug comment])

On Ubuntu Raring Ringtail (13.04) (and possibly on other versions), it is posible to simply edit the file /etc/default/keyboard, modify the XKBOPTIONS setting (for example XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps") and do:

 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

Which will apply the change to both virtual consoles and X.org.

=== On Gentoo Linux ===

For i386 systems, to make Caps Lock another control: In /etc/conf.d/keymaps set

  KEYMAP="emacs"

Then run <code># /etc/init.d/keymaps restart</code> (or reboot).  See /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs.map.gz for more information.

=== On Slackware GNU/Linux ===

Similar to Gentoo, you can add Caps Lock as another control key:

As super-user:

  $ loadkeys emacs
  $ echo "loadkeys emacs" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

You can just issue the second command and re-run rc.local, however
that will initiate any commands in rc.local.  This differs from my X
setup where the menu key is used as Caps Lock.  Currently for the
virtual console there is no Caps Lock (any suggestions on this?)

[new]
I no longer have Caps Lock key too but I have never used it before so
I do not see the need now it has been remapped to something else ;) -- XavierMaillard

[new]
The main thing I use the CapsLock for is environment variables; I have started getting out of using it by using AbbrevMode, however I still find some instances where it's useful.

After seeing how a friend of mine types (with her wrists flat on the table, and not moving her hands but straining to reach keys, also while holding modifier keys and depressing letters with the same hand), I'm seriously investigating whether the quirks of heavy keyboard use (dislike of CapsLock, accidentally hitting keys, RSI) are due to poor hand position instead of heavy typing use.  I've been typing heavily for years, and other than moving the CtrlKey, I've not developed any problems or developed the strong preferences indicated on some webpages.  I'd like to get a HappyHacking or Sun-style keyboard, but I'm concerned that nobody thinks it's a problem to only have one control key: the rationalization I've seen some people make is that I should use one hand to accomplish certain keystrokes (e.g., "\C-x\C-f", which I do rather more swiftly with two hands).

[new]
If you don't have a CapsLock key, it's still easy to type environment variables.  Just use <code>M-b M-u</code> to uppercase the last word.  -- HackerB9

=== NetBSD console ===

To /etc/wscons.conf add:
: mapfile /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c

then create the file /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c with the single line:
: keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L

This can also be tested immediately (doesn't require reboot) and temporarily (won't survive a reboot) with:
wsconsctl -w map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"

== OS X ==

Open System Preferences → Keyboard and choose Modifier Keys:

[[image:MacKeyboardPreferences.png|Mac Keyboard Preferences]]

Then select which of the four modifier keys should send Control:

[[image:MacKeyboardKeys.png|Mac Keyboard Modifier Keys]]

For Mac OS older than 10.4, [http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ uControl] allows switching keys.

The variable `mac-command-modifier' can be used to interpret the Command key as an additional Control.  This can be useful for Linux-like behavior when Caps Lock has already been remapped to Command.

In Emacs 22 (Carbon Port, CVS version) you can use the variable `mac-control-modifier' to remap the Control key.


== Microsoft Windows ==

=== AutoHotkey ===
On Windows you can use the [http://www.autohotkey.com/ AutoHotkey] program which uses "scripts" to remap the keyboard.

This section describes ho to swap Control and CapsLock, but with !AutoHotKey it is also possible to use Space both as Space and Control. See [[#Using space bar as both space and control]] below.

This method has a couple benefits.  One is scripts can be compiled to a stand alone <tt>.exe</tt> file which can be executed on a machine that doesn't have !AutoHotkey.  Another is, the key re-mapping can be set to only apply in emacs; the caps lock key will behave normaly in every other program. (If that's what you want.)

To remap the Caps Lock key to Ctrl save the following to a file named <tt><i>script</i>.ahk</tt>.  Then execute the script with AutoHotKey by double clicking it.  See the [http://autohotkey.free.fr/docs/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe  AHK2EXE] documentation to learn how to make scripts into stand alone executables.

    #IfWinActive emacs  ; if in emacs
    +Capslock::Capslock ; make shift+Caps-Lock the Caps Lock toggle
    Capslock::Control   ; make Caps Lock the control button
    #IfWinActive        ; end if in emacs

The original Caps Lock behavior is here mapped to Shift + Caps Lock.

If you want the caps lock to be the control key everywhere remove the lines that begin with "#IfWinActive".

If you want this AHK script to remain in effect across windows restarts place the script in your startup folder.
See the [http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup startup section of the AHK FAQ] for more specific directions.

=== Registry ===
* Applies across all user accounts.
* Requires Administrator access to write to the registry.

====NoCaps====
<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00
</pre>

====SwapCaps====
<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,3a,00,1d,00,00,00,00,00
</pre>


This can also be done by manually editing the registry to accomplish the same thing, see [http://geekquanta.blogspot.com/2007/07/remapping-ctrl-and-caps-lock-in-windows.html] for an explanation. 

To undo the changes, you can just delete the Scancode Map value, or run a .reg script with the following:
<pre>
REGEDIT4
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=-
</pre>

Note: the Synaptics touchpad driver for Windows reads the unmodified scancodes while 'PalmTouch' is active, so if you switch Ctrl and Capslock you will also have to turn off PalmTouch if you want to send 'Ctrl-Taps' using the touchpad.

[new]
You can instead make similar changes to
<pre>
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout]
</pre>
which makes the change for just the current user only. 


===Keymap===
There is a small piece of software called '''keymap''' which modifies the registry.

===KeyMapper===
It seems that keymap.exe does not work on Windows 7. KeyMapper (http://code.google.com/p/keymapper/) works fine.

===SharpKeys===
[http://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/ SharpKeys] works like Keymap and KeyMapper as it will modify the registry for you, and it is know to work with Windows 8.

=== In Lisp? ===
I know this is fairly simple to do for emacs only, but I've never looked into how exactly, and Lisp is not my forte.  Anyone?

: That is doubtful.

:: I am able to get the xorg under Cygwin on windows to switch the keys via a command line argument to xwin.  Surely then it should be possible to patch emacs to do this at least at the source level.  Anyone?
:: Also, what do you mean by "last method?" I don't see a method on here that doesn't require Administrator access.  I'd love to know one.

::: I think that when you run emacs through cygwin, it uses its own x server. When you give a command lin e switch to remap keys, you are effectively doing it across all of your X server. It just happens that your X server is only running emacs.
::: As far as I know, X does not allow per-application custom keybindings.

:: %%EmacsW32%% , with w32-enable-caps-lock set to nil , reads that key as <capslock>.  It should be possible to tell Emacs to treat it as a control.  (define-key function-key-map [(capslock)] 'event-apply-control-modifier) gets close.

=== Drivers ===
There are also these drivers: [http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/ctrl2cap.shtml ctrl2cap.sys] or [http://www.sysinternals.com/win9x/utilities/ctrl2cap95.shtml ctrl2cap.vxd].

http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Swap-CapsLock-and-Control.html#Swap-CapsLock-and-Control has more info about this.

Microsoft also provides an utility [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/Ctrl2Cap.mspx Ctrl2Cap] to replace the caps lock with the ctrl key.  (Note that you will lose the caps lock.)
It allows you to reverse it as well.

If you use the AutoHotKey (www.autohotkey.com) Win32 macro program, the following line in autohotkey.ini will effectively remap Caps to Ctrl:

<pre>
Capslock::Ctrl
</pre>

Here is a exe of the AutoHotKey script, so you don't have to download autohotkey itself.

The script: http://www.cs.umb.edu/~wimiller/stuff/caps2ctrl.exe

The source: http://www.cs.umb.edu/~wimiller/stuff/caps2ctrl.ahk

Notice that it also maps right control to caps lock, maybe someone cap upload one that does not do that.

[:Using space bar as both space and control]
== Using space bar as both space and control ==

An alternative to moving the control key, to avoid Emacs pinky, is to use the space bar as /both/ space and control.

If you press the space bar alone, it inserts a space. If you press it together with another key, it acts as a control key.

You can achieve this by using [https://gitorious.org/at-home-modifier/pages/Home at-home-modifier] in X (Linux only). And for MS Windows, !AutoHotKey with [https://github.com/benhansenslc/BigCtrl BigCtrl] script. And for Mac, [http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html keyremap4macbook].

This is not limited to ctrl -- shift, alt, or any other keys can be pressed with thumbs. See also the following [[#Japanese keyboard]] section.

History: This trick was invented by K. Kimura in 2001, and has been known as "!SandS", standing for "Space and Shift" (the original idea was to use the space as shift) to some users in Japan. See the [http://gitorious.org/at-home-modifier/at-home-modifier/blobs/raw/master/README README] of at-home-modifier for the full history.

[:Japanese keyboard]
== Japanese keyboard ==

Yet another alternative to moving the control key, to avoid Emacs pinky, is to use Japanese keyboard.

Japanese keyboard ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Japanese Wikipedia article]) has many keys that you can press with thumbs, to which you can bind modifiers. For example, the bottom row of Japanese keyboard can work as <nowiki>[alt][shift][ctrl][shift][alt]</nowiki> *and* <nowiki>[Esc][Bs][Space][Enter][Tab]</nowiki>, /all/ pressed by thumbs, by using "at-home-modifier" or !AutoHotKey mentioned in the previous section.

For experiences with Emacs and particular keyboards, see GoodKeyboards and Wiki:ErgonomicKeyboard (keyboards, pedals, etc.)

== Foot switch ==
[new] Another option is to use FootSwitches for Control key and other frequently used keys. For example I use two Usb pedals: one for Ctrl key, the other for Shift key, Shift+Space is bound to RET, and CapsLock for Backspace. -- SewerynKokot

== Keyboard and no admin privileges in MS Windows ==

[new]I was unable to find an answer to the question below.
All the remap solutions above assume that the user has Admin privileges under Windows, which is not the case for company-issued laptops. I am looking for an additional USB keyboard I could use at work...

Question: Where can I find a keyboard where CAPS LOCK can be programmed to be a CONTROL key "directly on the keyboard"?

My configuration:
company-issued Laptop with Windows 7
no administration privileges (cannot change Windows Registry)
normal QWERTY laptop with annoying CAPS LOCK key instead of the useful CONTROL key

All the keyboards I have googled have programmable function keys (gamers' keyboards...), but usual keys such as CAPS LOCK cannot be changed.

-- IanSinkrad

[new:tuffy:2012-03-11 14:54 UTC]
One such keyboard is Topre's Realforce 87U, which is sold at elitekeyboards.com.  It features a DIP switch setting for swapping the control and caps lock keys, and includes a keypuller and replacement keys so that the labeling will also be correct.  Though made by the same company that produces the Happy Hacking keyboards recommended on the [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GoodKeyboards GoodKeyboards] page, the Realforce is a much more traditional PC keyboard and the one I most prefer to use with Emacs.

-- Tuffy

Another keyboard is the WASD keyboards. They have a switch that allows you to control whether the Caps Lock key is a control or standard caps lock.

-- Elias

[new:aiguofer:2012-06-11 15:38 UTC]
You could also install AutoHotKey to a folder in your user account and do it that way.  I just did that and it's working perfectly.

-- Aiguofer

[new:nesiax:2013-03-04 00:00 UTC]
You could also make your own keyboard and hardware mappings, there is a libre keyboard design at http://www.key64.org/ which have been designed for emacs users in mind, it's design is ergonomic so is very comfortable to type with.
