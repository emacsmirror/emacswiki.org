[quote]Remembrance Agents are a set of applications that watch over a user's
shoulder and suggest information relevant to the current
situation. While query-based memory aids help with direct recall,
remembrance agents are an augmented associative memory. For example,
the word-processor version of the RA continuously updates a list of
documents relevant to what's being typed or read in an emacs
buffer. These suggested documents can be any text files that might be
relevant to what you are currently writing or reading. They might be
old emails related to the mail you are currently reading, or abstracts
from papers and newspaper articles that discuss the topic of your
writing.[/quote]

We are experimenting with remembrance agents in word processors, web
browsers, and on wearable computers. The word-processor version works
in Emacs and XEmacs.

== What it does ==

The RA consists of two parts: One part is an indexing program which
you should probably run in the background once a day.  It is written
in C and understands lots of document formats such as HTML, mail
folders, etc.  This index is used in the second part: An Emacs add-on
which looks at the text around point and searches for similar
documents in the index.  A little window at the bottom of the frame
lists the best matches and allows you to move there with a click.

I find remem fascinating and use it often when I write. The novel
Angel Deep

* http://paystream.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/thr33?page=demos/easy_episodes/angel [Broken link again]

is an example of remem's use.  Here is the load defun I use
<pre>
;;;  remem mode
(defun rharris-load-remem ()
  "Load remembrance agent mode"
  (interactive)
  (setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/share/emacs/remem" load-path))
  (load "remem.el")
  (setq remem-prog-dir "/usr/local/bin")
  (setq remem-database-dir "/usr/local/share/remem/db")
; scopes take form: (DIRN NUM-LINES UPDATE-TIME QUERY-RANGE) where:
;   DIRN is the subdirectory of remem-database-dir with the desired database
;   NUM-LINES is the number of lines that you want the scope to show (initially)
;   UPDATE-TIME is the time between scope updates (in seconds)
;   QUERY-RANGE number of words around your cursor that you want the scope to query on
  (setq remem-scopes-list '(("kjv" 2 10 500)
                            ("hdt" 2 10 500)))
)
</pre>

Then I use a data defining fn for each of the novel's voices.

<pre>
(defun rharris-remem-uncas ()
"Angel Deep: Uncas's voice"
(interactive)
(setq remem-scopes-list '(("bard_mov" 2 10 500)
                          ("hdt" 2 10 500)
                          ("lotm" 2 10 500)))
			  )
														  
</pre>

It has been a while since I used it.  I ended up not finding it
useful, perhaps there wasn't really that much personal data around,
thus not many related documents.  Perhaps this is for people like
RichardStallman who gets 400 mails a day or so... -- AlexSchroeder

I like RemembranceAgents. I index my blog and my mail during my shutdown sequence. I wish I had a faster computer, though... -- SachaChua
