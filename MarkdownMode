`markdown-mode' is a major mode for GNU Emacs which provides syntax highlighting and supporting commands for editing Markdown files. It provides key bindings and commands for inserting Markdown elements and to assist in calling a Markdown processor program to parse the source code or preview the document in a browser. It also, optionally, provides syntax highlighting for wiki links and embedded LaTeX mathematical expressions.

This page covers markdown-mode and packages to work with it.
==Manual==
There is a manual by the author at the package home page, http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/, which covers both installation and usage thoroughly.  The Emacs package documentation available through <kbd>C-h P</kbd> includes the same material.

For greater depth, the author also has an e-book, the "Guide to Markdown Mode for Emacs", available at https://leanpub.com/markdown-mode.

===Alternative manual===
There is an alterative manual, also extracted from the source code at [https://github.com/daniel-birket/markdown-mode-texinfo daniel-birket/markdown-mode-texinfo] 
on GitHub. This version is *not* authorized by the author of `markdown-mode'.  It is available in various formats, including Info, PDF and HTML.

==Generating tables of contents==
[https://melpa.org/#/markdown-toc markdown-toc] -- "a simple TOC generator for markdown"
== Linting==
[[https://melpa.org/#/flymake-markdownlint flymake-markdownlint]] -- is a FlyMake extension for Markdown

[[Flycheck]] supports Markdown, as noted in its documentation.

== Debugging parentheses ==
Markdown code can include a lot of parentheses, brackets, etc. that must be balanced.  See [[DebuggingParentheses]] for how to check this.

== Previewing==
This is supported via the built-in `markdown-live-preview-mode'.  This uses a local Markdown processor program to convert Markdown to HTML.

There are other options below, notably `impatient-showdown', which does not require a locally-installed Markdown processor.
===impatient-showdown===
[https://melpa.org/#/impatient-showdown impatient-showdown] provides live previewing without a local program by using a !JavaScript library that is downloaded by the generated HTML.
