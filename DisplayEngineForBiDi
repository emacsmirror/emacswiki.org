Eli Zaretskii wrote the code for the redisplay which takes into account
having Emacs SupportBiDi.  Buffers are kept in logical order.
The display engine thus has to implement a BiDiAlgorithm.

It is based on UAX#9 but uses a character-by-character-approach just
like current Emacs redisplay: Based on the current position in the
buffer, the "next" character is fetched.  Instead of just incrementing
the position, Eli does some scanning, caching, jumping and direction
reversing such that the "next" character for redisplay is indeed the
next character in visual order (in the window), but not necessarily
the next character in logical order (in the buffer).

UAX#9 is the Unicode Standard Annex #9 Technical Report and is
available at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/.
