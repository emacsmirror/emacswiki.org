This pages explains when to use defcustom, when to use defvar, when to
use defconst, and when to start the DocString with an asterisk `*'.
Variables with DocStrings that start with an asterisk are possible
candidates for `M-x set-variable'.  Since the user is supposed to type
the new value into the MiniBuffer, the possible values must be simple
to type!

Look at BufferLocalVariable for variables that have a different value
in every buffer (such as `buffer-file-name').

* Variable changed by users interactively

: Use `defvar' or `defcustom'. The DocString should start with `*'.
If the value is a long list, or a function, or if the variable would
be set only in init files, then don't start the documentation string
with `*'.

* Variable changed by users using custom

: Use `defcustom'. Maybe start DocString with `*'. See above for details.

* Variable set in ~/.emacs

: Use `defcustom' or `defvar'. Maybe start DocString with `*'. See above for details.

* Variable not changed by user

: If the variable is only used by code, use `defvar'. Do not start DocString with `*'.

* Variable not changed at all

: Use `defconst'. Do not start DocString with `*'.

* Development
: From the EmacsManual :

:: C-M-x (eval-defun)  treats `defvar' expressions specially.  Normally, evaluating
a `defvar' expression does nothing if the variable it defines already
has a value.  But C-M-x unconditionally resets the variable to the
initial value specified in the `defvar' expression.  `defcustom'
expressions are treated similarly.  This special feature is convenient
for debugging Lisp programs.
