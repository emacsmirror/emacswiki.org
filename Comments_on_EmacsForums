i want to use emacs as a compiler for python.  i dont want emacs for anything else but this.  whenever i open emacs, i want it to just be a compiler for python.  i have been instructed to add it to my filepath.

my questions are :

1.  how do i add python-mode.el (which is a file folder containing a bunch of stuff that i dont know anything about) to the filepath?

2.  is it possible to open emacs immediately to something that can compile python code?

You cannot "compile" Python code using Emacs. You can edit Python code. Any file ending in ".py" is automatically edited in Python Mode.

I have a more than 800 line Fortran 77 code which just became corrupt. The emacs editor displays some junk instead of the code I wrote but compilation in command prompt still runs and produces the correct results. What can I do?

To Marata: copy the current file to a backup copy, and then check the backup copy for stray characters:

     cat -vet backup_file | less

Look for something like CR+LF conversion, maybe a UTF or Unicode conversion from previously using an untested editor on the file, etc. When done, convert the file back to its standard format.
