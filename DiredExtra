The GnuEmacs library '''[::Dired X]''' (<tt>[::dired-x].el</tt>) provides extra functionality for DiredMode. It comes with Emacs.

A manual comes with Emacs documenting these _extra_ features for Dired Mode.  Originally written by SebastianKremer.

To use this mode run `M-x load-library RET dired-x RET' or add the following to your InitFile.

  (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
            (function (lambda () (load "dired-x"))))

Features include:

* Omitting "uninteresting" files from Dired listings
* Dired local variables file (##.dired##)
* Shell command guessing
* "Virtual Dired" allows you to view directories based on command output
* Cleaning commands
* Dired current file and file at point commands

There is no way to get only parts of dired-x and not the whole
thing.  Though, you can try with `autoload', it will eventually
take over.

  (autoload 'dired-jump "dired-x"
    "Jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buffer."
    'interactive)
  (autoload 'dired-jump-other-window "dired-x"
    "Like \\[dired-jump] (`dired-jump') but in other window."
    'interactive)
  (setq dired-bind-jump t)
  (global-set-key "\C-x\C-j" 'dired-jump)
  (global-set-key "\C-x4\C-j" 'dired-jump-other-window)
  
  (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys t)
  (setq dired-bind-man nil)
  (setq dired-bind-info nil)
  (eval-after-load "dired"
    '(setq dired-mode-map-orig dired-mode-map))
  (eval-after-load "dired-x"
    '(setq dired-mode-map dired-mode-map-orig))
