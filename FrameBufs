Frame-bufs is intended as a convenience for those who like to organize their workflow in Emacs by using specific frames for different projects. It extends Emacs’s buffer menu so that it understands a distinction between those buffers that are associated with a given frame and those that are not. The buffer menu can be toggled between a list of all buffers and a list of only those buffers associated with the selected frame. The criteria governing which buffers are associated with a frame can be customized through various options.  In addition, buffers can be manually added to and removed from the list of buffers associated with a frame. The package interacts properly with ##other-buffer## and respects changes in buffer ordering made by ##bury-buffer##. 

== Installation ==

Put the package file [[frame-bufs.el]] in your load path and put:

  (require 'frame-bufs)

in your ##.emacs##.  To enable frame-bufs, use the command ##frame-bufs-mode##, or put ##(frame-bufs-mode t)## in your ##.emacs##.

== Features Overview ==

When frame-bufs-mode is enabled, it keeps a record of which buffers are associated with each frame.  In the typical case, a buffer becomes associated with a frame if it is selected in one of that frame's windows.  Note, then, that a buffer can be associated with more than one frame.  We sometimes speak of a buffer that's associated with a frame as "frame-associated," and refer to the list of buffers that are associated with a given frame as that frame's "associated-buffer list."   (Frame-bufs does not alter the `buffer-list' or `buried-buffer-list' frame parameters of any frame; it keeps its own record of the buffers
associated with each frame.)
  
The buffer menu now has two modes:  it can either list all buffers (we call this "full-list mode") or only buffers associated with the selected frame ("frame-list mode").  By typing ##F## one can toggle between the two modes.   In full-list mode there is an additional column after the initial ##CRM## bit columns: the ##F## column.   Buffers associated with the selected frame are indicated with an `o' in this column.  In frame-list mode, the fourth column is suppressed.  Here are screenshots of the buffer menu in the two different modes:

|| [[image:FrameBufsLocalMode]] || [[image:FrameBufsFullMode]] ||
|| Buffer menu in frame-list mode, sorted by buffer size.  Only buffers associated with this frame are shown. || Buffer menu in full-list mode, sorted by buffer size.  All buffers are shown; the buffers associated with this frame are distinguished by an `o' bit in the fourth ##F## column. ||

When first called up, the buffer menu appears in full-list mode.  In subsequent calls it opens in whatever mode it was last in.

In addition to toggling between the two modes, there are two other new commands available in the buffer menu:

* A buffer can marked as to be added to the selected frame's associated-buffer list by typing ##A##.
* A buffer can be marked as to be removed from the associated-buffer list by typing ##N##.

As with save and delete commands in the buffer menu, these requested changes are effected by calling ##Buffer-menu-execute##.

== Further Control of the Local Buffer List ==

As mentioned above, a buffer automatically becomes associated with a frame if it is selected in one of that frame's windows.  Finer-grained control over which buffers are automatically associated with a frame is provided by the following variables:

* If ##frame-bufs-include-displayed-buffers## is non-nil, then buffers that are merely displayed on a frame become associated with it, even if they have not been selected.  (The default value is nil.)
* If a buffer's name is a member of ##frame-bufs-always-include-names##, then that buffer is associated with every frame.  (The default value is ##("*scratch*")##.)
* If the command that creates a new frame also creates new buffers, then one might want those buffers to be automatically associated with the new frame.  (For example, when one calls ##gnus## and thereby creates a new frame, it might be desirable to have the auxiliary buffers created by ##gnus## associated with the Gnus frame, even if those buffers haven't been selected.)  If ##frame-bufs-include-new-buffers## is non-nil, then such buffers are added to the new frame's associated-buffer list, even if they have not been selected or displayed.  (The default value is nil.)
*  If ##frame-bufs-include-init-buffer## is non-nil, then the buffer that is current when the command creating a new frame is called (the "init-buffer") will be associated with the new frame.  If nil, it will not.   (The default value is nil.)
* If ##frame-bufs-new-frames-inherit## is non-nil, then the associated buffers of  a new frame's "parent"--the frame that was selected when the command creating the new frame is called-- will be associated with the new frame.  (The default value is nil.)

== Other Commands and Features ==

* If ##frame-bufs-use-buffer-predicate## is non-nil, each frame's buffer predicate is set so that ##other-buffer## will prefer frame-associated buffers.  Thus, when a buffer is removed from a window and automatically replaced with another (as happens, say, when one kills a buffer), the newly displayed buffer will, if possible, be one associated with that frame.  (The default value is t.)

Frame-bufs also provides three other commands that are available everywhere, not just in the buffer menu:

* ##frame-bufs-dismiss-buffer## is somewhat analogous to ##bury-buffer##.  It removes a buffer from a frame's associated-buffer list, and if that buffer is displayed in any windows on the frame, it is replaced by another buffer.  When called with no arguments, it acts on the current buffer and selected frame.

* ##frame-bufs-reset-frame## resets a frame's associated-buffer list.  Specifically, it sets the associated-buffer list to the list of buffers that have been selected on the frame.  When called with no argument, it acts on the current frame.

* ## frame-bufs-reset-all-frames## resets the associated-buffer list of all frames.

== Compatibility and Other Considerations ==

Frame-bufs is compatible with BufferMenuPlus.  It does not affect the operation of ##electric-buffer-list##, ##bs-show##, or other buffer listing commands.
