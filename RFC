Internet RFCs are standards and discussion documents on various communications and computer topics.

: http://www.rfc-editor.org

Here are some Emacs things for working with or reading such documents,

* FindFileAtPoint -- Download an RFC number document at point
* [[Irfc]] -- View and download RFC document, provide advanced navigation function.
* RfcView -- Improve formatting for on-screen reading
* [https://github.com/zeph1e/rfcview.el rfcview] -- Browse, download, and read RFC documents in Emacs
* Lisp:rfc.el -- Browse RFC documents and the RFC index  -- see below
* [[rfc-el]] -- Browse RFC documents and the RFC index
* GetRFC -- Retrieve RFC document (remote or local) and display it using RfcView mode (by default)
* <code>rfcr.el</code>[http://members.fortunecity.com/salkosuo/emacs/index.html] by SamiSalkosuo -- Download and cache from IETF, by number or by browsing index
* FastFileFinder -- Includes retrieval of RFCs by number, locally or remote [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/#ui]
* [https://github.com/galdor/rfc-mode rfc-mode] -- The rfc-mode Emacs major mode is a browser and reader for RFC documents.

: It seems that Lisp:rfc.el requires w3 package for url-insert-file-contents that is already in vanila emacs 22.0.91.1.  To use it properly, just comment out the "(require 'w3)" line in rfc-insert-contents-url in Lisp:rfc.el. Someone please contact to its author to correct this. ;-) -- CinSK

In the wiki here, links to RFC documents can be made just by writing say RFC 1945.
