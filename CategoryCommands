=About Emacs commands=

* [[Command]] -- What a command is.  What turns an ordinary Emacs function into a command. `M-x' and `<code>M-:</code>'.
* DisabledCommands -- Hiding certain commands from the user.
* CancelingInEmacs -- Stopping something you started, not to be confused with undoing.
* InteractiveFunction - How to make a function an interactive command.
* MinibufferHistory -- Retrieve and re-execute previously executed commands.
* RepeatingCommands -- Repeating an individual command or a sequence of commands (e.g. keyboard macros).
* KeyboardMacros -- Record your commands then play them back.

= Packages for command manipulation= 

* ShowKey -- Show a log of keys you use and their commands.
* CommandLogMode -- Similar to ShowKey.
* KeyCast -- Similar ShowKey but show the key and command on the mode line, not in a window.
* InteractionLogMode -- Show an exhaustive log of your interactions with Emacs.
* DoReMi -- Define commands that change things incrementally.
* ExecAbbrevCmd -- Execute Emacs commands by typing their abbreviations
* [[Icicles]] -- Define commands that read and match input (simple or [[regexp]]), providing input-[[completion]] and [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] of matching candidates. Define multiple-choice commands and menus easily.
* CommandSubset -- Like `M-x' but with only a subset of the available commands. 

= Packages for command suggestion=
* [[Recs]] -- Suggest a more efficient command when a command
sequence matches a pattern of commands defined as a regular expression.
