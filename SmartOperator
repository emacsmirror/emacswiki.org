----

[[smart-operator.el]] is a tool to automatically add spaces around operators on input.

For example:

  x=5

will become:

  x = 5 


----

I personally found the approach of modifying the local map uncomfortable.  I'd rather have a minor mode instead, so I wrote this additional code:

  (defun smart-operator-self-insert-command (arg)
    "Insert the entered operator plus surrounding spaces."
    (interactive "p")
    (smart-operator-insert (string last-command-char)))

  (defvar smart-operator-mode-map
    (let ((keymap (make-sparse-keymap)))
      (define-key keymap "=" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "+" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "-" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "/" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "%" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "&" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "*" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "!" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "|" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "<" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap ">" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "," 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap "." 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      (define-key keymap ":" 'smart-operator-self-insert-command)
      keymap)
    "Keymap used my `smart-operator-mode'.")

  (define-minor-mode smart-operator-mode
    "Insert operators packed with whitespaces smartly."
    nil " _=_" smart-operator-mode-map)

What does it mean "I wrote this additional code".  I looked in the linked source, and it defines a minor mode. The code looks exactly like what you provided here.  Has smart-operator.el been updated to reflect your solution?

Oh, I see now.... The header comments in that code give a mention to [[nschum]] for the suggestion to make it into a minor mode.  So, anyone who is reading this -- if you get the smart-operator.el module referenced above, it includes the code from [[nschum]].

fixed function name for 'smart-operator-insert'; BTW remember this all needs a preceeding:

  (require 'smart-operator)

Nice extension but it is buggy with C/CC comments:
* "/*" -> "/ *"
* "*/" -> "*/ "
* "//" works fine
It also fails with --:
* "i++" -> "i ++"
* "i--" works fine
