Near links are green instead of blue, and a popup-help will list the name of the wiki they will redirect to. This wiki is near-linked to Community Wiki.

I recently got a question from a user by email regarding these green links and the creating of local copies of these remote pages.
I finally decided that these near pages provided a minuscule benefit and a somewhat rare drawback – in short, they weren't worth keeping.
