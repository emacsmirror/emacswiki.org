* If you use X then you can use `M-x make-frame-on-display' (see [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Multiple-Displays.html EmacsManual:Multiple Displays]) for collaborative editing or supporting newbie Emacs users remotely.  See also [Groups:&selm=m37l24d069.fsf@tarski.2y.net Re: two people editing one document]. The problem here is that connection issues can cause both frames to hang.
* If you have emacs 23, multi-tty works like make-frame-on-display, except that each person needs to connect to your emacs.  (This is somewhat similar to using screen, but each user can resize their terminal without affecting the others.)  You can give each user their own colored "point" with JonathanRockway's [http://github.com/jrockway/elisp/blob/master/_local/colorful-points.el colorful-points] mode.  The connection can also be accelerated (reducing lag time over a slow connection) using mosh [http://mosh.mit.edu].
** Anyone have a more detailed description of how to set this up?
* [[Rudel]] is a collaborative editing extension for GNU Emacs written purely in Emacs Lisp. It is designed to support multiple protocol backends to enable interoperability with other collaborative editors. The most complete backend implements the [http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/ Obby] protocol mentioned above. Using this backend, Emacs can act as an Obby client and as an Obby server (possibly at the same time). Due to a limitation of gnutls-bin, the server does not support encryption.
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU Screen] is a terminal multiplexer. Run Emacs in console mode (##emacs -nw##) within ##screen## for multi-user real-time collaborative editing (and much more). Works across *n*x, Mac OS X, even W32 (with Cygwin installed). Check out Bill Clementson's [http://bc.tech.coop/blog/071001.html awesome emacs/screen setup].
** One minor problem is that screen has to run setuid root for users to share a screen session. An alternative is to use [[tmux for collaborative editing]], which doesn't have this requirement.
* SubEthaEmacs is a (dead?) attempt to get Emacs to grok [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/SubEthaEditProtocol SubEthaEdit's closed collaborative editing protocol]. The authors of SubEthaEdit are actively hostile to interop attempts.
* [http://docsynch.sourceforge.net/ Docsynch] is an open cross-editor collaborative editing protocol that runs over IRC. Plugins exist for JEdit, vim and a few other editors, but only the JEdit version seems to be complete. Development seems stalled. (Last news item was dated 2004.)
* [http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/ Obby] is another open protocol. The reference implementation is called [http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/ Gobby] and is a cross-platform GTK editor. [[Rudel]] (mentioned above) uses Obby. [http://dev.technomancy.us/ebby ebby] was an attempt to work with an older version of the Obby protocol; it's now deprecated.
* [[Egret]] -- An extension to XEmacs.
* [http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Shemacs/ Shemacs] is a tool implementing synchronous multi-user support for the Emacs editor using Egret, a client-server-agent framework for implementation of domain-specific, collaborative, hypertext systems.
* [http://github.com/technomancy/conspire/tree/master Conspire mode] achieves realtime, collaborative editing using git as a backend. Works only over a LAN.
* [[Google_Wave_for_Emacs]] -- An ongoing discussion concerning future [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave Google Wave] support in Emacs.
* [https://floobits.com/help/plugins/emacs Floobits] provides real-time collaboration tools for a variety of editors including an Emacs plugin.
* [https://github.com/tjim/lockstep Lockstep] synchronizes two frames (cursors and visible buffers) so that the "passenger" sees the edits of the "driver" in real time.

LukeGorrie wrote shbuf http://www.bluetail.com/~luke/shbuf/ which formerly required erlang for the server (since emacs didn't have server sockets) but I think it only requires gnumacs now (xemacs doesn't have server sockets) --ShaeErisson

I just found this:

http://verse.blender.org/cms/Overview.573.0.html

Even though it seems aimed at 3D-development, the descriptions seems to suggest that the protocol is general.
