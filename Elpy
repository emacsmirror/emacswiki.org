* 1. Solving company, yasnippet conflicts *

When you type an abbrevation & hit tab, it won't expand as company takes over. You can add this snippet in Your .emacs to solve that problem

{{{
(defun company-yasnippet-or-completion ()
  "Solve company yasnippet conflicts."
  (interactive)
  (let ((yas-fallback-behavior
         (apply 'company-complete-common nil)))
    (yas-expand)))

(add-hook 'company-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (substitute-key-definition
             'company-complete-common
             'company-yasnippet-or-completion
             company-active-map)))

}}}
