==Overview==

Visual navigation through mark rings.

https://raw.github.com/rolandwalker/back-button/master/back_button_example.png

==Quickstart==

    (require 'back-button)
    (back-button-mode 1)
    press the plus sign in the toolbar to create a mark
    press the arrows in the toolbar to navigate marks
    or use C-x C-Space as usual

==Explanation==

Back-button provides an alternative method for navigation by
analogy with the "back" button in a web browser.

Every Emacs command which pushes the mark leaves behind an
invisible record of the location of the point at that moment.
Back-button moves the point back and forth over all the positions
where some command pushed the mark.

This is essentially a replacement for `pop-global-mark', and the
default keybindings (when the minor mode is activated) override
that command.  The differences with `pop-global-mark' are:

* Visual index showing how far you have traveled in the mark ring.

* Easy way to move both forward and backward in the ring.

* Pushes a mark on the first of a series of invocations, so you can always return to where you issued the command.

* Skips duplicate positions, so that the interactive command always moves the point if possible.

Commands and keybindings are also included to give identical
semantics for navigating the local (per-buffer) `mark-ring'.  This
consistency in navigation comes at the cost of pushing the mark
twice, so experienced Emacs users may prefer to unbind these
commands and/or set `back-button-never-push-mark' in customize.

When the visible-marks package is installed, marks will be
made visible in the current buffer during navigation.

==Default key bindings==
	C-x C-<SPC>    go back in `global-mark-ring', respects prefix arg  
	C-x C-<left>   go back in `global-mark-ring'  
	C-x C-<right>  go forward in `global-mark-ring'  

	C-x <SPC>      go back in (buffer-local) `mark-ring', respects prefix arg  
	C-x <left>     go back in (buffer-local) `mark-ring'  
	C-x <right>    go forward in (buffer-local) `mark-ring'  

When the smartrep package is installed, the `C-x' prefix need not
be used for consecutive `back-button' commands.

== Notes == 
This library depends upon other commands pushing the mark to
provide useful waypoints for navigation.  This is a common
convention, but not universal.

The function `back-button-push-mark-local-and-global' may be
useful to call from Lisp.  It is essentially a replacement for
`push-mark' which unconditionally pushes onto the global mark
ring, functionality which is not possible using vanilla
`push-mark'.

Theoretically, `back-button-push-mark-local-and-global' could
cause issues with Lisp code which depends on the convention that
`global-mark-ring' not contain consecutive marks in the same
buffer.  However, no such issues have been observed.
