This file allows a user to connect to and download files from the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispList EmacsLispList], an early package listing site which dates to [https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/ellcover.html at least 1999].  Its goal was to "...provide one compact list with links to all of the current emacs lisp files out there on the internet". 

The Emacs Lisp List is still accessible as of this writing in early February 2026, and last updated in 2014.
