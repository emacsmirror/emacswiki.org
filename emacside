Another small yet powefull implementation of an IDE in Emacs.

Emacside features the ability to run commands native, run emacs lisp commands or run commands within custom a shell.

Every command can have it's own environment. Meaning you do not need to modify environment variables on your system to get a working compiler.


It is a wrapper for compilers and shells.
It allows compiling applications just with emacs, without make.

Emacside is simple and does not need any additional packages.
