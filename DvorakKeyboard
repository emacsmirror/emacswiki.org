== Useful Emacs key bindings in combination with a Dvorak layout ==

One of the first problems an experienced Emacs user finds when converting
from a QWERTY to a Dvorak layout is the fact that many commonly used
key-combos involving <code>C-x</code> such as <code>C-x C-f</code>,
<code>C-x C-s</code> or <code>C-x C-w</code> are no longer easy to type.
This is because in the Dvorak layout <code>x</code> and these other keys
belong to different hands.

One possible solution to this problem is to give yourself /another/
<code>C-x</code> in the right-hand side, where the keys <code>f</code>,
<code>s</code>, <code>w</code> and <code>r</code> are.  A good
candidate for this is <code>C-z</code>, which doesn't get used that
much these days and is available at <code>C-x C-z</code> anyway:

   (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") ctl-x-map)

Another, more subtle, problem is that <code>C-p</code> and <code>C-n</code>
are now on different sides of the keyboard, making fast cursor positioning
difficult.  If you are willing to have the `help' keymap on <code>C-x
C-h</code> (or to use the additional binding on <code>F1</code>)
you can bind <code>C-h</code> to <code>previous-line</code>:

   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-h") help-map)
   (global-set-key (kbd "C-h") 'previous-line)

This also has the charm that all four basic cursor movement bindings
are on the right hand now, with <code>previous-line</code> and
<code>next-line</code> on the home row.

Also the following bindings are convenient in combination with a Dvorak
layout:

    (global-set-key [?\C-.] 'execute-extended-command)
    (global-set-key [?\C-,] (lookup-key global-map [?\C-x]))
    (global-set-key [?\C-'] 'hippie-expand)


[new]
I personally like these:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-h") 'backward-kill-word)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-t") 'previous-line)

but that might be just because I never got in the habit of using transpose.  -- NoahTye

== The classic Dvorak layout and Emacs ==

The classic Dvorak layout has the numeric keys arranged as follows:

    7  5  3  1  9  0  2  4  6  8

Using this layout gives the Emacs user numeric arguments (accessible
through <code>C-</code>''number'') of similar values and range on
''both'' hands.  Contrast this with the simplified Dvorak layout where
all lower numeric arguments are on the left hand and the higher ones on
the right hand.

== Comments from Dvorak users ==

I started using Emacs the same week I switched to Dvorak, several
years ago now. They really do seem to fit perfectly together and I
always kinda secretly wondered if the emacs keybindings were made with
Dvorak in mind. The only thing I've remapped was <code>C-h</code> to
"delete", so I can have it right between <code>C-d</code> and <code>C-t</code>.

Well, in a way they were made with "alternate layouts" in mind, because
it uses mnemonics rather than positions (e.g. <code>hjkl</code>-cursors)
for its bindings, but it seems to work *better* with Dvorak than with
qwerty. <code>C-a</code> and <code>C-e</code> gets to be on the same
line, <code>C-x</code> right in the middle of the keyboard where it's
supposed to be, and so on.

I highly recommend that anyone using the Dvorak keyboard go to this
page: MovingTheCtrlKey.

Once that's done and you've gotten used to it, the <code>C-x</code>
thing is no problem anymore and Dvorak feels like the most natural
layout for Emacs.  I swear it just seems like the keys were meant for
this layout.

That's exactly my thoughts!
So it seems like a lot of emacs bindings are actually meant for dvorak
layout, but how did that happen? I don't believe in such coincidences! 
Maybe it happened automagically because most bindings are set to the
first letters of real words and dvorak just has these located in a better way?

== Making C-x easier to hit ==
C-x is the by far the most common key I use so it has to be comfortable.

Firstly, I suggest you remap Ctrl to Caps Lock via xmodmap or your desktop environment. This puts it right up alongside the home row. Perfect! C-x is still a stretch though. The logical choice is to put C-x under your index finger on the home row. Ctrl-u currently occupies that position. Since it's used less commonly, lets swap them.

There are plenty of bad examples around on how to swap keys in Emacs. The best way is as described in the Emacs FAQ 10.11.

    (keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-u)
    (keyboard-translate ?\C-u ?\C-x)

This does a low-level translation of the keys before mapping them to commands. That way it won't mess things up like re-mapping the keys can.

[new]
Beware that as soon as you evaluate the first expression, C-x does not work anymore, and you can't issue C-x C-e to evaluate the second expression; therefore you'd better evaluate them with eval-region. 

[new]
I would recommend to use:

 (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-x] [?\C-u])
 (define-key key-translation-map [?\C-u] [?\C-x])

keyboard-translate doesn't work in daemon mode. See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2009-10/msg00505.html for details.
