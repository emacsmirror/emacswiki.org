With our move to https, things can get a bit tricky.

Except that it is 403 even if you visit that url directly.

OK, I obviously need a new place on the net to store it. I was storing it in Dropbox, and it was working for me, but apparently only when my browser had my credentials cached. Thanks for the heads-up, AlexDaniel.

You can always upload it to this wiki. See AlexSchroederPortrait. Then use the URL for that image -- ##https://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/AlexSchroederPortrait##. It's what I do.
