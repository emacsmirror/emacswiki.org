A major mode for editing Makefiles. Part of [https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/progmodes/make-mode.el GNU Emacs] and XEmacs.

Here are things extending <code>makefile-mode</code>,

=== Extending makefile-mode for nmake ===

I was always wondering why there are quite a lot of modes derived from
<code>makefile-mode</code>: Obviously ''gmake'', but also ''automake''
and ''imake'' mode, but no ''nmake'' mode.
Maybe because it takes 5 minutes to look at the other derived modes and
come up with your own derived mode for ''nmake''. At least if you are only
looking for syntax highlighting and not for the other advanced features of
the <code>makefile-mode</code>. So here is what I have
in my .emacs file. (Note the ''require'' line: although the prefix for all
variable and functions is ''makefile'', the filename itself is called
<code>make-mode.el</code>)

  (require 'make-mode)
  
  (defconst makefile-nmake-statements
    `("!IF" "!ELSEIF" "!ELSE" "!ENDIF" "!MESSAGE" "!ERROR" "!INCLUDE" ,@makefile-statements)
    "List of keywords understood by nmake.")
  
  (defconst makefile-nmake-font-lock-keywords
    (makefile-make-font-lock-keywords
     makefile-var-use-regex
     makefile-nmake-statements
     t))
  
  (define-derived-mode makefile-nmake-mode makefile-mode "nMakefile"
    "An adapted `makefile-mode' that knows about nmake."
    (setq font-lock-defaults
          `(makefile-nmake-font-lock-keywords ,@(cdr font-lock-defaults))))

And finally for convenience I add the ''.mak'' suffix to the ''auto-mode-alist'':

  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '("\\.mak\\'" . makefile-nmake-mode) auto-mode-alist))
