The idea is to create a user style sheet to override the defaults
your browser is presenting you.  See also [[CSS]].


== User Stylesheets ==

/Note:/

In the past, it was possible to override a site's CSS via a custom user stylesheet, but as of this writing in 2025, Google Chrome no longer supports user stylesheets.

While they're still technically possible with Firefox, Mozilla [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-advanced-customization-and-configuration does not recommend them] as of 2024.

Emacs' [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html eww] does not support CSS at all.


== Settings ==

=== Margin ===

If you browse with a very wide window, you can still force text to
wrap at acceptable line widths as follows:

    p, blockquote, li { max-width: 35em; }

This will not override max-width if a site ''does'' specify it.

=== Background ===

If you don't like websites specifying background colors, such as the
Emacs Wiki, you can counter that by using the !important keyword.
This overrides the settings for ''all'' sites, however, and you might
not want to do this.

    body { background-color: #DDD !important; color: #000 !important; }
    * { background: inherit !important; color: inherit !important; }
    a { color:#00F !important; }
    a:visited { color:#A0A !important; }

=== A Stylesheet For EmacsWiki Only ===

In order to support settings per-site, you can specify a class for the
body attribute, because Oddmuse wikis carry the URL of the wiki in
their body class.

For all of the above settings to apply to the Emacs Wiki only, and
only when using the URL ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs##, put
the following in your user style sheet:

    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] { background-color: #DDD !important; color: #000 !important; }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] * { background: inherit !important; color: inherit !important; }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] a { color:#00F !important; }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] a:visited { color:#A0A !important; }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] img.logo { border-style:solid !important; }

=== Logo ===

Notice in the above code how I sneaked in a border for the logo,
because the logo has a white background instead of a transparent
background.

The problem with a logo with a transparent background is that people
can just force all sites to use specific background colors.  If they
choose grey, for example, the logo will look very different, because
you cannot see the stylized E anymore.  You can hide the logo by
inserting in the CSS something like:

   body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] img.logo { visibility:hidden;}

CSS2 allows you to insert content thus putting your own logo. For instance if you want to put a new logo
after the header you can use something like:

    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] div.header:after {
        content: url(file:///my/path/my_emacs_wiki_logo.png);
        display: block;
    }

If you use display:none for the logo, then the entire element will be
gone, and therefore img.logo:after or img.logo:before will have no
effect.  Use visibility:hidden instead.

Positioning does not seems to work for the inserted content. So
you'll probably have to find a workaround for your stylesheet.

=== Small Problems ===

Take care not to redefine two elements in one line ie:

    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] code, pre {color: #EDC !important; font: 90% monospace;}

This leads to some global redefinitions of some elements (At least for me
under linux with Mozilla 1.3 and Firebird 0.6).

: That's the correct behaviour because the comma has a higher precedence than the other parts of the selector. Therefore, that example will select code elements inside a body with that class or a pre element. --[[db48x]]

== Some user stylesheets ==

RomainFrancoise: I like light gray backgrounds, and narrow columns for
text.  I also decided to shrink the logo a bit, and to justify text so
that it's nice to look at.  My "stylesheet" is:

    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] { 
    background-color: #d1d1d1 !important; 
    color: #000 !important;
    padding-left: 15% !important;
    padding-right: 15% !important;
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] * { 	
    font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif !important; 
    background: inherit !important; color: inherit !important;
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] a { 
    color: #606060 !important; 
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] a:visited { 
    color: #303030 !important; 
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] img.logo { 
    border: 1px solid #000 !important;
    width: 98px !important;
    height: 56px !important;
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] p, blockquote, li { 
    max-width: 35em !important;
    text-align: justify !important;
    }
    body[class="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs"] input {
    border: 1px dashed #000 !important;
    }
