From the Commentary:

 ;; gds.el provides a couple of commands to interface Google Desktop
 ;; Search (GDS) from Emacs.
 ;;
 ;; gds.el should work on all operating systems where GDS exist.
 ;; Currently it seems only to exist officially in Microsoft Windows
 ;; and Mac OSX but there is supposedly some sort of beta for GNU/Linux
 ;; as well.
 ;;
 ;; Basically all it does is to build a URL with the search, send it to
 ;; GDS and do different fun things with the result.  The commands
 ;; currently implemented are `gds', `gds-iswitchb-open-file' and
 ;; `gds-dired'.
 ;;
 ;; It is easy to use, just customize `gds-search-url' and get going! I
 ;; recommend starting with the `gds' command.

Screenshot of the `gds' command. The other two looks more or less as what they integrate with, i.e. iswitchb and Dired...
