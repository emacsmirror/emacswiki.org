This is the only tutorial I actually fully understand in ew. To the person who wrote this, thank you so much in explaining the concept using languages to a non-computer expert.

This is a great tutorial! Although, I'm surprise by the lack of information on getting Ispell/Aspell to work with Emacs on Windows, and that it requires the use of a free software binary more than a decade old. It's a pretty standard requirement for some.

Sorry, but the last comment is non-sense...

Can you be more explicit? It seems very much relevant.

Sorry I'm not sure how to set this (setq ispell-personal-dictionary "C:/path/to/your/.ispell")

What is personal dictionary? Is this the second installed dictionary from website? Or it is my own dictionary (I do not have an dictionary, so make a blank file?)
