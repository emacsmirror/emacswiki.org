Emacs keeps track of files that you are currently editing by creating a symbolic link that looks like ##.#-emacsa08196##. Prior to Emacs 28, these files cannot be moved to a different directory (unlike [AutoSave] files and [BackupFiles]). 

You can disable creation of lock files in Emacs versions >= 24.3 with the following setting:

   (setq create-lockfiles nil)

For Emacs 28 and later, similarly to `auto-save-file-name-transforms`, the files are generated using `lock-file-name-transforms`. To make Emacs write all lock files to ##/var/tmp##, you can use the following, but it might not be wise to do this.

   (setq lock-file-name-transforms
      '(("\\`/.*/\\([^/]+\\)\\'" "/var/tmp/\\1" t)))
