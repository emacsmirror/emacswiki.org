Lisp:blip.el

[[image:BlipElScreenShot]]

blip.el is an emacs package for interfacing with Blip (http://blip.pl),
a Polish microblogging service. The blip.el package allows you to post
and receive status updates.

blip.el is heavily based on twit.el (version 0.3.5) which can be found on TwIt.
Some parts had to be rewritten because of the differences between blip.pl and twitter.com,
others where copied almost without any changes and finally some features were dropped (at least for now).

There are some differences between twitter and blip.
First of all blip allows the user to associate extra content with a blip: 
pictures, videos and recordings.
Twitter uses @, .@ to note replies and users. Blip uses ^username to mark users,>username to direct msgs a user and >>username to private msg.
Blip API uses JSON for data transmission.


Currently blip.el allows posting with M-x blip-post and seeing blips from the dashboard (M-x blip-show-recent-blips).

I am aware that this package is quite messy. There is probably a lot code that could be removed and other things that could be cleaned up. Maybe I will get around to do it someday, but for now I decided that it's better to post a half working solution then to hold it for indefinite time.
I also hope that authors of TwIt won't mind that I copied a lot of their work.
