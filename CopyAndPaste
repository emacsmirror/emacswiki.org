== Terminology ==

Emacs has its own terminology for these concepts:

|| *Common Name* || *Common Key* || *Emacs Name*   || *Emacs Key* ||
|| Cut           || ##C-x##      || Kill           || ##C-w##     ||
|| Copy          || ##C-c##      || Kill-ring-save || ##M-w##     ||
|| Paste         || ##C-v##      || Yank           || ##C-y##     ||
|| —             || —            || Yank next      || ##M-y##     ||

If you do not care for the DefaultKillingAndYanking [[key binding]]s, then consider these alternatives:

* PcSelectionMode -- the Windows and Motif flavour with ##C-<ins>##, ##C-<del>##, and ##S-<ins>##.
* CuaMode -- use ##C-x##, ##C-c## and ##C-v## to copy and paste
* CuaLightMode -- something between PcSelectionMode and CuaMode
* DeleteSelectionMode -- ##DEL## deletes the region; just typing replaces it.
* WholeLineOrRegion -- ##C-w## and ##M-w## act on the current line when TransientMarkMode is not active

== X11 Copy & Paste to/from Emacs: ==

X copy and paste support has historically [http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt been a mess]. This is relevant, as Emacs supports the various aspects of this mess.

Important for this discussion is the understanding that X generally distinguishes between two types of /selection/, the /PRIMARY/ and the /CLIPBOARD/. Every time you select a piece of text with the mouse, the selected text is set as the /PRIMARY/ selection. Using the /copy/ function will place the selected text into the /CLIPBOARD/. Pasting using the middle mouse button will insert the /PRIMARY/ selection, pasting using the paste function will insert the /CLIPBOARD/.

With this out of the way, starting with Emacs 24.1, GNU Emacs should already do the right thing here. If you dislike this behavior, there are two options you can customize:

* ##x-select-enable-primary## - default ##nil##; set this to ##t## if you want the Emacs commands ##C-w## and ##C-y## to use the primary selection.
* ##x-select-enable-clipboard## - default ##t##; set this to ##nil## if you want the Emacs commands ##C-w## and ##C-y## to use the clipboard selection.

Yes, you can have Emacs use both at the same time.

This does not affect pasting using the middle mouse button. By default, this uses ##mouse-yank-primary##, which will only look at the /primary/ selection. If you want the middle mouse button to insert the /clipboard/ instead, use the following:

  (global-set-key (kbd "<mouse-2>") 'x-clipboard-yank)

Finally, in other applications, pasting usually replaces the selected text with the contents of the clipboard. To enable this behavior in Emacs, use DeleteSelectionMode with the following:

  (delete-selection-mode)


=== XEmacs ===

 (setq interprogram-cut-function 'own-clipboard)
 (setq interprogram-paste-function 'get-clipboard)
