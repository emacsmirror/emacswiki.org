Wow, spammers being mega achievers these days! Thanks, Drew Adams for sending me an email and letting me know.
Some days I feel like we'll end up banning all commercial hosting providers… Thank you all for fighting the good fight! EmacsWikiAdministrators can add entries to BannedHosts and BannedContent. When rolling back a page the wiki offers you to ban contributors and it lists all the URLs that where removed, both of which helps you add the necessary entries. – [[Alex Schroeder]]
