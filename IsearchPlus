This page is about '''[::Isearch+]''', that is,  library '''<tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt>''' and its companion library '''<tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>'''.  These libraries extend standard Emacs library ##isearch.el##, which provides IncrementalSearch.  (Neither of these extension libraries requires the other. They are complementary, but they enhance each other.)

----

[:isearch-prop.elFeatures]
== isearch-prop.el Features ==

These are the main '''<tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>''' features:


[:isearchp-property-forward]
[:isearchp-property-forward-regexp]
[:isearchp-property-backward]
[:isearchp-property-backward-regexp]
* You can search ''within character-property zones''.  Example: search within zones having a `face' text property with a value of `font-lock-comment-face' or `font-lock-string-face'.  Search [[overlay]]s or [[text property|text properties]]. From within Isearch: '''`C-t'''' (or '''`C-M-t'''' for [[regexp]] search).  First time, or with a [[prefix argument]], you are prompted for the property and its values.  See the doc string of command '''`isearchp-property-forward''''.

[:isearchp-put-prop-on-region]
* Besides relying on other code to set `face' and other text
properties for use with `C-t', you can use command
'''`isearchp-put-prop-on-region'''' (outside of Isearch) to add a text
property to a zone of text.  By default, it applies the last
property and value whose zones you searched using `C-t', but a
[[prefix argument]] lets you specify the property and value to apply.
This gives you an interactive way to set up zones for
text-property search (`C-t').  For property `face', empty input
removes all faces from the region.

[:hlt-highlight--isearch-matches]
[:hlt-unhighlight--isearch-matches]
* If you also use library [[HighlightLibrary|Highlight]] (<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>) then you can highlight and
unhighlight Isearch matches in different faces, including for
multiple-buffer searches.   The simplest way to do this is to
use `M-s h f' (to highlight) and `M-s u f' (to unhighlight)
while searching. 



[:isearchp-zones-forward]
[:isearchp-zones-forward-regexp]
[:isearchp-zones-backward]
[:isearchp-zones-backward-regexp]
* If you also use library [[Zones]] ('''<tt>[[zones.el]]</tt>''') then  you can 
search a set of [[buffer]] zones that are defined by their
limits ([[marker]]s or numbers) -- like multiple [[region]]s, using
commands '''`isearchp-zones-forward'''' and
'''`isearchp-zones-forward-regexp''''.  You can use different such
zone sets.  Library ##zones.el## gives you an easy, interactive
way to define them.  A [[prefix argument]] to the commands that search a
set of zones prompts you for a [[variable]] whose value is such a
set.  By default the variable is `zz-izones'.


[:isearchp-make-zones-invisible]
[:isearchp-make-anti-zones-invisible]
[:isearchp-make-zones-visible]
[:isearchp-make-anti-zones-visible]
[:isearchp-toggle-zones-invisible]
[:isearchp-toggle-anti-zones-invisible]
[:isearchp-toggle-zone-anti-zone-visibility]
* If you use library ##zones.el## then you can also make a set of zones or its complement (the set of anti-zones) invisible, so that you do not see it at all, including while searching.  The commands for this are '''`isearchp-make-zones-invisible'''', '''`isearchp-make-anti-zones-invisible'''', '''`isearchp-toggle-zones-invisible'''', '''`isearchp-toggle-anti-zones-invisible'''', and '''`isearchp-toggle-zone/anti-zone-visibility''''. 




[:isearchp-add-zones-from-lazy-highlighting]
[:isearchp-set-zones-from-lazy-highlighting]
[:isearchp-noncontiguous-region-from-lazy-highlighting]
* If you use library ##zones.el## then you can also, during Isearch, replace (`M-s z s') or update (`M-s z a') the current list of zones from the
boundaries of lazy-highlighted text, or you can create a
noncontiguous region from that text (`M-s z r').


[:isearchp-toggle-complementing-domain]
* You can search zones of text/overlays that have a given property, as described above, or you can search the ''complement'': the zones that do ''NOT'' have a given property - the '''anti-zones'''.  You can toggle this search-domain complementing at any time during Isearch,
using '''`##C-M-~##'''' (command `isearchp-toggle-complementing-domain').

[:isearchp-dim-non-prop-zones-flag]
[:isearchp-dimming-color]
*  When you search propertied zones, the non-searchable zones are
''dimmed'', to make the searchable areas stand out.  [[option|Option]]
'''`isearchp-dim-non-prop-zones-flag'''' controls whether such dimming
occurs.  You can toggle it anytime during Isearch, using '''`C-M-D''''
(aka `C-M-S-d').  Option '''`isearchp-dimming-color'''' defines the
dimming behavior.  It specifies a given background color to use
always, or it specifies that the current background color is to
be dimmed a given amount.

[:isearchp-thing]
[:isearchp-thing-define-contexts]
* You can search the text of THINGS of various kind (sexps, lists,
defuns, lines, pages, sentences, filenames, strings, comments,
xml/html elements, symbols,...), using command '''`isearchp-thing''''.
This is equivalent to using command
'''`isearchp-thing-define-contexts'''', which marks such zones with a
text property, and then using `isearchp-property-forward'.

[:isearchp-next-visible-thing]
[:isearchp-previous-visible-thing]
* Not related to searching, but you can also move forward and
backward among things of a given kind, using the repeatable
commands '''`isearchp-next-visible-thing'''' and
'''`isearchp-previous-visible-thing''''.  For best results I 
recommend that you also use library <tt>[[thingatpt+.el]]</tt>.  It
enhances the vanilla treatment of THINGS and fixes various
vanilla thing-at-point bugs.


[:isearchp-imenu]
[:isearchp-imenu-command]
[:isearchp-imenu-macro]
[:isearchp-imenu-non-interactive-function]
* You can search the text of EmacsLisp definitions of different
kinds, using commands '''`isearchp-imenu'''',
'''`isearchp-imenu-command'''', '''`isearchp-imenu-macro'''', and
'''`isearchp-imenu-non-interactive-function''''.  Since ImenuMode is based
on regexps that recognize definitions, these commands are based
on the behavior of `isearchp-regexp-context-search'.

[:isearchp-remove-property]
[:isearchp-remove-all-properties]
* You can ''remove properties'' from text or overlays using commands
'''`isearchp-remove-property'''' and '''`isearchp-remove-all-properties''''.
By default, the latter removes only properties whose names begin
with `isearchp-'.  These are the properties inserted
automatically by the commands of library <tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>, when you do not
specify a property.

[:isearchp-toggle-hiding-comments]
[:isearchp-toggle-ignoring-comments]
* You can hide or show code comments during Isearch, using '''`##M-;##''''
(command '''`isearchp-toggle-hiding-comments'''').  You can toggle
ignoring comments during Isearch, using '''`##C-M-;##'''' (command
'''`isearchp-toggle-ignoring-comments'''').






















----

== isearch+.el Features ==

These are the main '''<tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt>''' features:

* You can dynamically add and remove any number of filter predicates while searching.  You can search for things that are near other things, for instance.  See '''DynamicIsearchFiltering'''.

* Case-sensitivity is indicated in the [[mode line]] minor-mode lighter: '''`ISEARCH'''' for case-insensitive; '''`Isearch'''' for case-sensitive.

* Optional highlighting of the first eight [[regexp]]-group levels in the current search hit,
controlled by option
'''`isearchp-highlight-regexp-group-levels-flag''''.  For
lazy-highlighting of other search hits, the odd groups are
highlighted differently from the even groups.  The same highlighting is available for `query-replace-regexp' ('''`##C-M-%##'''), if you also use library '''<tt>[[replace+.el]]</tt>''' -- see '''ReplacePlus'''.

: This is the effect for a search hit for regexp 
##(##'''##\(##'''##[-a-z*]+##'''##\)##'''## *##'''##\(##'''##(##'''##\(##'''##([-a-z]+ *##'''##\(##'''##[^)]*##'''##\)##'''##)##'''##\)##'''##)##'''##\)##'''##.*##
:


:: [[image:IciclesSearchContextLevelsScreenshot]]

* Highlighting of the mode-line [[minor mode]] lighter (indicator) when search has wrapped around (Emacs 24+ only).

* Highlighting of parts of the prompt, to indicate the type of
search: regexp, word, multiple-buffer, and whether searching has
wrapped around the buffer (Emacs 22+ only).


[:isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag]
[:isearchp-deactivate-region-flag]
* Optional restriction of search to the [[active region]], controlled by option '''`isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag''''.  Deactivation of the active region is controlled by option
'''`isearchp-deactivate-region-flag''''.  Both of these are available
for Emacs 24.3 and later.

** You can use '''`C-x n'''' (command '''`isearchp-toggle-region-restriction'''') and '''`C-SPC C-SPC'''' (command
'''`isearchp-toggle-region-deactivation'''') during search to toggle `isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag' and
`isearchp-deactivate-region-flag', respectively, but in each case the new value takes effect only when the current search is exited.

** Restriction of Isearch to the region works also for a
''rectangular'' region (which you create using `M-x rectangle-mark-mode').

** NOTE: For search to be limited to the active region in Info, you
must also use library [[Info+]].

[:modeline-position]
[:query-replace]
* If you use library ModeLinePosition (<tt>[[modeline-posn.el]]</tt> then not only can you restrict Isearch to the active region but you can keep that restriction when you invoke a query-replacement command from Isearch (e.g. `##M-%##' from Isearch, to use `query-replace'). The main job of that library is to show information about the active region in the [[mode line]].  And whenever you invoke a replacement command or Isearch for the active region, that region information is highlighted specially. See ModeLinePosition for screenshots and more info.




[:isearchp-set-region-flag]
[:isearchp-toggle-set-region]
[:set-region-around-search-target]
* [[option|Option]] and commands to let you select the last target occurrence (set the [[region]] around it):
** Option '''`isearchp-set-region-flag'''' -- Non-`nil' means automatically set the region around the last search target.
** Command `isearchp-toggle-set-region', bound to
'''`M-s M-SPC'''' during isearch -- toggle `isearchp-set-region-flag'.
** Command '''`set-region-around-search-target'''' -- manually set the region around the last search target.




[:isearchp-act-on-demand]
[:isearchp-on-demand-action-function]
* When you visit a search hit, you can perform an ''action'' on it.
Use '''`C-M-RET'''' (command `isearchp-act-on-demand' -- Emacs 22+
only) to invoke the action function that is the value of option
'''`isearchp-on-demand-action-function''''.  That function is passed
the current search-hit string and its start and end positions in
the buffer.  Search moves to the next hit in the same search
direction, so just repeating `C-M-RET' carries out the action on
subsequent hits.



[:isearchp-replace-on-demand]
* The default value of `isearchp-on-demand-action-function' is
function `isearchp-replace-on-demand', which ''replaces the search
hit''.  This means that you can replace (or delete) chosen search
hits on demand.
By default, the replacement string is empty, so with no prefix
argument the action is to ''delete'' the search hit (replace it with
nothing).


* With a [[prefix argument]], `isearchp-replace-on-demand' ('''`C-M-RET'''') prompts for the
replacement, which is used thereafter until you again use a
prefix arg.  Since you can use a prefix arg at any time, you can
provide ''different replacements'' for different search hits.  When
prompted, if you clear the minibuffer and hit `RET', hit
replacement just becomes search-hit ''deletion''.
['''NOTE:''' To use a prefix arg within Isearch, you must set
'''`isearch-allow-prefix'''' (if available) or '''`isearch-allow-scroll''''
to non-`nil'.]

** With a ''plain'' prefix arg ('''`C-u'''') or a numeric prefix arg of
value '''1''' (e.g. `C-1'), `isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces
only the current search hit.

** With a ''negative'' prefix arg (e.g. '''`M--'''' or '''`C--''''),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' toggles automatic replacement by just searching.  Automatic replacement means that each time
you use a search key (e.g. `C-s') to visit a search hit, the
hit is automatically replaced, without your needing to hit
`C-M-RET'.  Using a prefix arg again with `C-M-RET' cancels
this (as does quitting and restarting Isearch).

** With a ''positive'' prefix arg ''N'' (e.g. `C-8' or `C-u 200'),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces ''N'' search hits (but it
stops at the search limit, if reached).

** With a ''zero'' prefix arg (e.g. `C-0'),
`isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces ''all'' remaining search
hits (up to the search limit).


* When you use on-demand replacement (with `C-M-RET') the replacement text can be either inserted literally, as is, or interpreted as in `query-replace-regexp'.  In the latter case, you can use `##\&##', `##\=\N##', `##\###', `##\,##' and `##\?##'.

** For example, suppose you use a regexp-search pattern of ##`\(e\)\|a'## and a replacement pattern of ##`\,(if \1 "a" "e")'##.  Each `C-M-RET' will then swap `e' for `a' and vice versa.

** See the doc for `query-replace-regexp' and node `Regexp Replace' of the Emacs manual for more information.

** (Note that `##\?##' is supported, but it is not very useful in this context, because it prompts you to edit the result each time you hit `C-M-RET'.  Instead, use `C-u C-M-RET' whenever you want to change (edit) the replacement pattern.)


[:isearchp-toggle-literal-replacement]
* You can use `##C-M-`##' (`isearchp-toggle-literal-replacement') anytime during Isearch to toggle whether replacement text is used literally or interpreted per the special regexp-replacement constructs.

** Note that the use of the special regexp replacement patterns is unrelated to the kind of incremental search: literal string search or regexp search.  Just remember that the way to switch on/off the special behavior of `##\&##' and so on is to use `##C-M-`##'.


[:isearchp-noprompt-action-function]
* The value of variable `isearchp-noprompt-action-function' is a function that is invoked automatically, after you visit each search hit.  The function is called with no arguments.  It cannot use the minibuffer, but it can modify buffer contents.  The variable is reset to `nil' when you quit Isearch.  As an example of use, command `isearchp-replace-on-demand' with a negative prefix arg sets this to `isearchp-replace-match', which causes automatic replacement each time you visit a search hit.


[:isearchp-nomodify-action-hook]
* Hook `isearchp-nomodify-action-hook' (Emacs 22+ only) is also run after each search visit.  Its functions also must accept the same arguments as `isearchp-act-on-demand'.  The functions can use the minibuffer, but they must not update the buffer text (in a way noticeable by Isearch), or else that will likely lead to a call-stack overflow.  This is because they are called with Isearch suspended during `isearch-update' (which can itself be invoked by the action...).





[:isearchp-regexp-quote-yank-flag]
[:isearchp-toggle-regexp-quote-yank]
* [[option|Option]] ('''`isearchp-regexp-quote-yank-flag'''') and command (`isearchp-toggle-regexp-quote-yank', bound to '''`##C-`##'''') to toggle quoting (escaping) of [[regexp]] special characters.  With escaping turned off, you can yank text such as ##^\*.*## without it being transformed to ##\^\\\*\.\*##.




[:isearchp-eval-sexp-and-insert]
* '''`##M-:##'''' ('''`isearchp-eval-sexp-and-insert'''') prompts you for a Lisp
[[sexp]], evaluates it, and appends the value to the search string.
This is useful, for example, to use `rx' or another
regexp-creation helper to create a [[regexp]] search pattern.
For example: `##C-M-s M-: (rx (and line-start (1+ (in "("))))##'
searches using the result of that `rx' sexp, which is ##"^(+"##.
(The double-quote chars are removed.)
Remember too that you can use '''`##C-u M-:##'''' after '''`M-e''''.  That
inserts the sexp value into the [[minibuffer]], where you are
editing the search string.  Use this when you do not want to
simply append the sexp value to the search string, but instead you want
to do some editing of it or the rest of the search string.




[:isearchp-retrieve-last-quit-search]
* '''`M-g'''' ('''`isearchp-retrieve-last-quit-search'''') yanks the last successful search string (regexp or plain) from when you last hit `C-g' in Isearch.  Sometimes you search for something but abandon the search --- you just want to check the locations of something, without staying at any of them.  Afterward, if you want to find them again, use `M-g'.  This yanks that search string, so you can append it to whatever you are already searching for.

[:isearchp-append-register]
* '''`C-x r g'''' ('''`isearchp-append-register'''') appends the contents of a
[[register]] to the search string.  You are prompted for the
register to use.  This is the same key that is bound globally to
`insert-register'.  If you want this key to instead exit Isearch and
insert the register in the buffer, then define this key in
`isearch-mode-map' as `nil` (i.e., unbind it), and optionally bind
`isearchp-append-register' to a different key in
`isearch-mode-map'.

[:isearch-yank-secondary]
* '''`C-M-y'''' ('''`isearch-yank-secondary'''') yanks the [[secondary selection]] onto the search string, if you also use library <tt>[[second-sel.el]]</tt> (see [[SecondarySelection#secondary-sel.el|secondary selection enhancements]]).

[:isearchp-yank-char]
* '''`##C-c##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-char'''') yanks successive characters onto the search string.

[:isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char]
* '''`##C-_##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char'''') yanks successive [[symbol]]s (or words or subwords or chars) onto the search string.

[:isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char]
* '''`##C-(##'''' ('''`isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char'''') yanks successive [[sexp]]s (or symbols or words or subwords or chars) onto the search string.


[:isearchp-kill-ring-save]
* '''`M-w'''' (`isearchp-kill-ring-save') copies the current search string to the [[kill ring]].  You can then, for example, use `C-s M-y' to search for the same
thing in another Emacs session.  (I use this all the time, but you might not use multiple Emacs sessions.)  Note that if you did not have this feature then you would need to select the search-string text (in the text buffer or in the `M-e' Isearch edit buffer) and copy it to the kill ring.  (Note: `M-w' used to toggle word search, but `isearch-toggle-word' is now `M-s w'.)

* All commands that yank text onto the search string are bound to keys with prefix `C-y' (in addition to any other Isearch bindings):

     C-y C-_   isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char
     C-y C-(   isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char
     C-y C-2   isearch-yank-secondary
     C-y C-c   isearchp-yank-char
     C-y C-e   isearchp-yank-line
     C-y C-w   isearchp-yank-word-or-char
     C-y C-y   isearch-yank-kill
     C-y M-y   isearch-yank-pop

:: You can repeat any of these for which it makes sense (i.e., all except `isearch-yank-secondary', `isearch-yank-kill', and `isearch-yank-pop') by just repeating the last key.  For example: `C-y C-e C-e C-e' adds the text up to the end of three lines.

[:isearch-char-by-name]
* '''`C-x 8 RET'''' ('''`isearch-char-by-name'''') reads the name of a Unicode character with
completion and appends it to the search string.  Same thing when
editing the search string (i.e., after `M-e').  This is part of GnuEmacs starting with Emacs 24.4.

[:isearchp-open-recursive-edit]
* '''`C-x o'''' ('''`isearchp-open-recursive-edit'''') opens a recursive editing session, where you can do
anything you like (including search for something different).
Using '''`C-M-c'''' closes the recursive editing session and resumes
the search (from the current position when you hit `C-M-c').

[:isearchp-resume-with-last-when-empty-flag]
* Option '''`isearchp-resume-with-last-when-empty-flag'''' non-`nil'
(the default) means that if Isearch is resumed with an empty
search string, after being suspended, the previous search string
is used.  If `nil', it is resumed with an empty search string,
as if starting over from the resumed location.

* `C-g' after successfully finding matches restores not only the original position but also its relative position in the window.  IOW, you get back to what you saw before searching.  Fixes GnuEmacs [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12253|bug #12253]] for Isearch.

* Highlighting of the mismatched portion of your search string. This is the portion that is removed if you do `C-g', or removed/replaced manually if you use `C-M-l' (see next) or automatically if you use `M-k' (see below).  I added this feature to GnuEmacs 23.1.

[:isearchp-remove-failed-part]
* '''`C-M-l'''' ('''`isearchp-remove-failed-part'''') removes the failed part of the search string, if any.  `C-g' does this as well, but
`C-g' also has an effect when search is successful.

[:isearchp-remove-failed-part-or-last-char]
* '''`##C-<backspace>##'''' ('''`isearchp-remove-failed-part-or-last-char'''')
also removes the failed part, if any.  If there is none then it
removes the last character.  You might prefer to bind this to
`DEL' (Backspace), in place of `isearch-delete-char'.


[:isearchp-cycle-mismatch-removal]
[:isearchp-drop-mismatch]
* '''`M-k'''' ('''`isearchp-cycle-mismatch-removal'''') cycles automatic removal or replacement of the input portion
that does not match.  The behavior
is controlled by the value of option '''`isearchp-drop-mismatch'''':

** `replace-last' -- Your current input ''replaces'' the last mismatched text.  You can always see your last input, even if it is a mismatch.  And it is available for editing using `M-e'.

** `nil'  -- Your current input is ''appended'', even if the
previous input has a mismatched portion.

** anything else -- Your current input is ''ignored'' (removed) if it causes a mismatch.  The search string always has
successful matches.


[:isearchp-drop-mismatch-regexp-flag]
* Option '''`isearchp-drop-mismatch-regexp-flag'''' controls whether
[[regexp]] search respects option `isearchp-drop-mismatch'.  If
`nil' (the default value) then regexp search acts as if
`isearchp-drop-mismatch' were `nil'.  This is because typing a
regexp such as `##[a-w]##' can be problematic when mismatches are
automatically replaced.  There is no problem for many regexp
patterns however, so you might prefer customizing this to
non-`nil' and using `M-k' to turn `isearchp-drop-mismatch' off
only temporarily, when needed.


[:isearchp-repeat-search-if-fail-flag]
* Non-nil option '''`isearchp-repeat-search-if-fail-flag'''' means that
Isearch fails only when there are no search hits within the
search limits.  If there are search hits, and if there are no
more hits in the current search direction, then search restarts
automatically at the limit.  You can toggle this behavior using
'''`M-s M-k'''' anytime during Isearch.


[:isearchp-ring-bell-function]
* You can use option '''`isearchp-ring-bell-function'''' to suppress or
replace bell ringing (`ding') during Isearch (but not for
quitting with `C-g').  Set it to `ignore', for example, to
suppress any indication of an error.  Set it to a function such
as `echo-bell' (from library <tt>[[echo-bell.el]]</tt>), to indicate errors
only visually.

[:isearchp-toggle-option-flag]
* Non-`nil' option '''`isearchp-toggle-option-flag'''', which you can
toggle using '''`M-s v'''' (`isearchp-toggle-option-toggle'),
determines whether commands that toggle behavior also toggle an
associated user option.  For such commands, a [[prefix argument]]
flips the behavior, as if `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' were
toggled temporarily.  Currently this feature applies to toggles
'''`M-c'''' (case-sensitivity) and '''`M-s i'''' (matching hidden text).


[:isearch-togg-case-fold]
* '''`M-c'''' (`isearch-toggle-case-fold') toggles case sensitivity.  If
option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-`nil' then it toggles
''option'' '''`isearchp-case-fold'''' to change the sensitivity ''from now
on''.  Otherwise, the option value is not changed, so the effect
is for the current search only.

[:isearch-toggle-invisible]
* '''`M-s i'''' (`isearch-toggle-invisible') toggles invisible-text
sensitivity.  If option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-`nil'
then it toggles ''option'' '''`search-invisible'''' to change the
sensitivity ''from now on''.  Otherwise, the option value is not
changed, so the effect is for the current search only.


[:isearchp-toggle-search-invisible']
* '''`##C-+##'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-search-invisible'''') toggles the value of
''option'' '''`search-invisible''''.  The effect is like that of `M-s i'
with no prefix argument and with non-`nil'
`isearchp-toggle-option-flag'.


[:isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlighting]
* '''`M-s h L'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlighting'''') toggles the
value of ''option'' '''`isearch-lazy-highlight''''.  Turning this
highlighting off can sometimes speed up searching considerably,
in particular for [[#isearchp-toggle-symmetric-char-fold|symmetric character folding]].


[:isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlight-cleanup]
* '''`M-s h l'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlight-cleanup'''') toggles the
value of ''option'' '''`lazy-highlight-cleanup''''.  When the option
value is `nil' you can continue to see the search hits
highlighted from the last search.  Toggle the option off, or
use command `isearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup', to remove the
highlighting.  When `M-s h l' turns cleanup on it also sets option
`lazy-highlight-buffer' to `nil', turning
off full-buffer highlighting.


[:isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlight-full-buffer]
* '''`M-s h b'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-lazy-highlight-full-buffer'''') toggles
the value of option '''`lazy-highlight-buffer''''.  When the
value is `t' Isearch lazy-highlights the entire buffer.  The
default value of `nil' means it lazy-highlights only the buffer
parts currently shown (but previously highlighted parts remain
highlighted).  `M-s h b' also toggles option `lazy-highlight-cleanup', in the
other direction.  This is because in most cases where you want
to lazy-highlight the whole buffer you also want to keep that
highlighting.  You need Emacs 24.3+ to take advantage of
`lazy-highlight-buffer'.


[:isearchp-toggle-showing-match-number]
* '''`##M-s ###'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-showing-match-number'''')  toggles showing
the current match number and total matches in the Isearch prompt
(option '''`isearch-lazy-count'''').


[:isearchp-toggle-limit-match-numbers-to-region]
* '''`##M-s %##'''' ('''`isearchp-toggle-limit-match-numbers-to-region'''')
toggles whether match number are limited to the [[active region]]
when option '''`isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag'''' is non-`nil'.  (Emacs
24.3+)

* There are almost ''30 Isearch toggle commands'', depending on
whether you use optional libraries such as <tt>[[isearch-prop.el]]</tt>,
<tt>[[zones.el]]</tt>, and <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>.  Each toggle is bound to a short
key.  In addition, they are all on prefix key '''`##M-=##'''', by default.
They are on prefix keymap `isearchp-toggles-map' which you can
bind to any key in `isearch-mode-map'.  If you forget a `##M-=##'
toggle key, you can use '''`##M-= C-h##'''' while searching to show them
all.


[:goto-longest-line]
* Other bindings during Isearch:
** '''`next'''', '''`prior'''' repeat the last Isearch forward and backward (easier than using the [[chord]]s `C-s', `C-r').
** '''`C-end'''' -- go to the longest line. Repeat to go to the longest line following that one in the buffer. As usual, `C-g' puts you back where you started. This binding is made only if you also use library <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>. See [[FindLongLines#goto-longest-line|Find Long Lines]].
** '''`C-h'''' provides ''help'' on Isearch while searching. Library <tt>[[isearch+.el]]</tt> also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists ''all'' Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly.

[:isearch-edit-string]
* '''`M-e'''' ('''`isearch-edit-string'''') automatically puts the [[cursor]] at the first mismatch position in the search string, for easy editing.  Whereas `C-g' (see also `M-k') removes all of the mismatch, this feature lets you change or insert a character or two, without losing the rest of the search string.

[:isearchp-initiate-edit-commands]
* A [[user option]], '''`isearchp-initiate-edit-commands'''', that specifies [[command]]s whose [[key]]s will not exit Isearch but will instead initiate editing of the search string.  For example, if `backward-char' is included in the list then `C-b' and `left' will just move the [[cursor]] backward over the search string so you can change, delete, or insert chars in the middle somewhere.  This makes the search string more [[minibuffer]]-like.


[:isearchp-mouse-2-flag]
* You can, by default, select text with the mouse, then hit `C-s'
etc. to search for it.  This is controlled by [[user option]] '''`isearchp-mouse-2-flag''''.



[:isearchp-toggle-symmetric-char-fold]
* If you also use library [[CharacterFold+]] then you can use
'''`##M-s =##'''' (command `isearchp-toggle-symmetric-char-fold') to toggle whether character folding is ''symmetric''.
''This feature is not available now, since vanilla Emacs changed the way vanilla file ##character-fold.el## works.''
