Use the form at the bottom of RecentChanges to filter the list.

*Include minor changes* also lists changes that the author marked as minor.

*Include rollbacks* lists changes that were done by the system after somebody clicked on the rollback button. Such rollbacks are used to revert spam and vandalism and there donâ€™t show.

*Title* filters the list using a regular expression matching the page titles.

*Title and Body* filters the list using a regular expression matching the page title or body. This is slow.

*Username* filters the list using an exact match with the username provided by the author.

*Host* filters the list using an exact match with the IP address used. As these get removed after a while, this is only useful to find certain kinds of vandalism as it is happening.

*Follow up to* filters the list for changes made after (!) a change made by the given user name. If you provide your own username, for example, you can find the pages edited by somebody else after you did.

*Language* filters the list for pages in a particular language. The language is given by a two letter code and matches a regular expression. Use ##en|de## to filter for German and English pages. See LanguageIdentification for more.

The changes to the ElispArea are slow to compute and therefore a static page is updated regularly: [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/changelog.html Show changes to Elisp files and packages]
