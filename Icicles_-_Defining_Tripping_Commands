== Defining Icicles Tripping Commands ==

[[Icicles - Tripping]]
describes the use of '''Icicles''' tripping (aka navigation or browsing)
[[multi-command]]s.  This page tells you how to define your own
such commands for custom trips -- it is thus for EmacsLisp
programmers.

The best way to learn how to do this is to look at how the
existing tripping commands are defined.  Some of them use macro
`icicle-define-command'; others do not.  Some use 
building-block function `icicle-explore' or `icicle-apply';
others do not.  Several use `icicle-search' as a building block.




[:icicle-define-command]
=== Using `icicle-define-command' ===

Those that use `icicle-define-command' take advantage of some
extraneous way to obtain trip location information from a display
candidate, which is just a string.  For example, `icicle-bookmark'
ultimately uses the
display string to look up location information in a bookmarks
file.  Those that use `icicle-explore' or `icicle-apply' make use
of location information stored in the [[alist]] ##COLLECTION## argument to
`completing-read'.

You can also use `icicle-define-command', `icicle-explore', and `icicle-apply' to define
multi-commands other than browsing commands -- the action function
can do anything you like.




[:icicle-explore]
=== Using `icicle-explore' ===

'''`icicle-explore'''' is a higher-order function that takes as
arguments the following functions, in addition to accepting
the optional `completing-read' arguments.  

* A function to build a candidates alist (##COLLECTION##) for
  [[completion]].  It fills `icicle-candidates-alist' with the
  candidates, each of which is a [[cons]] with a display candidate
  string as [[car]] and (typically) location information as [[cdr]].  For
  example, `icicle-find-tag' uses the tag text as display
  candidate and the standard tag-locating information as the cdr:
  tag info, file path, and goto function.

* A function that acts on the candidate finally chosen (`RET'),
  when completion is finished.

* A function to call if the user hits `C-g' during completion.

* A function to call if an error is raised during completion.

* A function to call after completion is finished, to clean things
  up.

If you also bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that
takes a display candidate (string) as argument and navigates to
the corresponding location, then `icicle-explore' does everything
you need for an Icicles trip.  You can use function
`icicle-get-alist-candidate' to get the location information for a
given display candidate.

Note: `icicle-explore' binds user option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-incremental-completion|icicle-incremental-completion]]</tt>'''' 
`to `always', because I think you
typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
on.  Functions that call `icicle-explore' thus also turn on
incremental completion.  This includes the predefined '''Icicles'''
commands `icicle-find-tag' and `icicle-search', and the many
specialized '''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|search commands]] derived from `icicle-search'.
Remember that you can use `<tt>C-#</tt>' (once or twice) to turn 
incremental completion off.


[:icicle-apply]
=== Using `icicle-apply' ===

'''`icicle-apply'''' binds `icicle-candidate-action-fn' appropriately
and calls `icicle-explore'.  It applies its function argument to
completion candidates the user acts on (using `C-RET' etc.).  It
applies the function to the full alist entry, that is, the display
candidate [[car]] plus any additional information in the [[cdr]].  For a
tripping command, the additional information provides a location
and the function applied takes you there.

This use of an alist that stores location information in the cdrs
is what makes `icicle-apply' and `icicle-explore' particularly
suitable for defining navigation multi-commands.  The '''Icicles'''
macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
make no such provision, but with suitable arguments you can use
them too to define tripping commands.

Note: `icicle-apply' binds user option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-incremental-completion|icicle-incremental-completion]]</tt>'''' 
`to `always', because I think you
typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
on.  Functions that call `icicle-apply' thus also turn on
incremental completion.  This includes the predefined '''Icicles'''
commands `icicle-goto-marker' and `icicle-goto-global-marker'.
Remember that you can use `<tt>C-#</tt>' (once or twice) to turn 
incremental completion off.

[:icicle-search]
=== Using `icicle-search' ===

'''`icicle-search'''' is another high-level function for defining
tripping commands.  Like `icicle-apply', it calls
`icicle-explore', but it also provides features for searching
[[bookmark]]s, [[buffer]]s, and files.  It takes as arguments the search
limits (region), if any, and either a regexp or a function that
determines the unfiltered search hits.  It does everything else
needed to define a trip command that uses search hits as
completion candidates.  Several predefined '''Icicles''' tripping
commands were defined using `icicle-search'.

Note: `icicle-search' effectively binds user option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-incremental-completion|icicle-incremental-completion]]</tt>'''' 
`to `always', because I think you
typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
on.  Other '''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|search commands]] are defined using `icicle-search', so they also effectively 
turn on incremental completion.
Remember that you can use `<tt>C-#</tt>' (once or twice) to turn 
incremental completion off.



[:OnFoot]

=== Tripping on Foot ===

You should be able to define any tripping commands you need using
`icicle-explore', `icicle-apply', or `icicle-search'.

If, however, for some reason you decide to define one at a lower,
pedestrian level (that is, without using any of those building
blocks), then bind '''`icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p'''' to `t' around the call to `completing-read'.  You can then use
'''`icicle-get-alist-candidate'''' to retrieve the candidate [[cdr]]
(e.g. location) information from the completion result.

However, if the action or alternative action function that you need
''modifies'' the existing set of completion candidates on the fly, as
a side effect, then bind `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p'
to '''`nil'''' ''in the action function''.  Then modify both
'''`minibuffer-completion-table'''' and '''`icicle-candidates-alist'''' as
needed to perform the side effect.

'''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace|search-and-replace]] provides an example of this.  When you
replace text, the original domain of search-hit candidates (with
their associated location information) is altered, so that you can
continue replacing coherently.  (See the code for
`icicle-search-action' and
`icicle-search-highlight-and-maybe-replace'.)

Because such side effects can change the meaning of cycling state
information such as the current candidate number, '''Icicles''' does not
automatically save such state information before a candidate
action and then restore it afterward.

For example, search-and-replace removes a search-hit candidate, as
a side effect, if the replacement text no longer matches your
input.  In that case, a current candidate number recorded before
the action would no longer correspond to the same candidate.

For this reason, if your action function does ''not'' perform any such
side effects on the candidates, and you want to restore the
cycling state as it was before a candidate action, then you might
want your ''action function'' to save and then restore the values of
'''Icicles''' variables such as '''`icicle-candidate-nb'''',
'''`icicle-last-completion-candidate'''', and
'''`icicle-completion-candidates''''.
