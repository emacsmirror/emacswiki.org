How Setup Google Talk in Emacs with JabberEl

== Basic installation ==

jabbber.el is packaged in MarmaladeRepo so you can just:

{{{
M-x package-install jabber
}}}

=== Configuring ===
Customize the variable `jabber-account-list' to have:

||JID||your gtalk username||
||Network Server||talk.google.com||
||Port||5223||
||Connection type||Legacy SSL||

=== Starting ===
Just do:

{{{
M-x jabbber-connect-all
}}}

and you will be connected.

== Manual installation ==
The jabber.el package comes with installation notes but it can be more tricky to configure.

=== jabber.el 0.7.1 and below ===
Setting up emacs to use Google Talk is pretty easy since it uses the
XMPP protocol, which is handled by jabber clients.  [[JabberEl]] works
well (at least from the arch sources available), and setup the
following variables, either through customization or in your .emacs
file:

  (setq jabber-username "username")
  (setq jabber-password "password")
  (setq jabber-nickname "nick")
  (setq jabber-connection-type (quote ssl))
  (setq jabber-network-server "talk.google.com")
  (setq jabber-server "gmail.com")

For example:

{{{
(setq jabber-username "my-username" ;; notice: leave off the @gmail.com
      jabber-server "gmail.com"     ;; this is a part of your user ID, not a part of the server you will connect to.
      jabber-network-server "talk.google.com"  ;; this is the actual server to connect to
      jabber-port 5223
      jabber-connection-type 'ssl)
}}}

After that, you might find this function handy:

  (defun jabber ()
    (interactive)
    (jabber-connect)
    (switch-to-buffer "*-jabber-*"))

Allowing you to M-x jabber to load up the client.

==== Problems with SSL on Gentoo ====
Under gentoo, I had to install the gnutls package to get everything working just fine, your mileage may vary.  

==== Problems with SSL on OSX ====
I can verify that the above worked (on MacOS X). However, I had some difficulties at first. The version of gnutls installed by Mac ports would always throw an error when I tried to connect: (I could see this by switching to the buffer *-jabber-process-*)

{{{
*** Fatal error: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.
*** Server has terminated the connection abnormally.
}}}

I installed a more recent version of gnutls (2.8.3), and modified both my PATH environment variable and my exec-path setting via Emacs-customize in order to ensure that that most recent version of gnutls was used, and not the version installed by Mac ports.

Once I did that, jabber connected to Google talk swimmingly.

=== jabber.el 0.7.90 and later ===
If you use both Emacs and Gnus from CVS, you can probably get away
with just hitting C-x C-j C-c and entering your Gmail address, but
most of us mortals will need a setup like the following:

  (setq jabber-account-list
    '(("username@gmail.com" 
       (:network-server . "talk.google.com")
       (:connection-type . ssl))))

And make sure that you have either gnutls-cli or openssl installed
and in your path.  Then C-x C-j C-c should Just Work™.

== Multi-user Chat ==

Here is a function to create use google groupchat:

  (defun egh:jabber-google-groupchat-create ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((group (apply 'format "private-chat-%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x-%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x@groupchat.google.com"
                          (mapcar (lambda (x) (random x)) (make-list 32 15))))
            (account (jabber-read-account)))
        (jabber-groupchat-join account group (jabber-muc-read-my-nickname account group) t)))


For versions 0.8.x of JabberEl there may be an issue when connecting with Multi-user chat. You may have to set the variable `jabber-muc-disable-disco-check' to <code>t</code> for disable disco checking if the above function doesn't work(or popup the buffer). 
For more information read the [http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net/manual-0.8.0/Groupchat.html#Groupchat jabber.el v.0.8.0 groupchat manual] third paragraph.

== Success Stories ==

Works great for me after installing gnutls package on Mac OS X using [http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/ homebrew]

<code>$ brew install gnutls</code>

Very useful package, best way to integrate Google Talk as we did @ [http://www.egga-referencement.ch egga] (Switzerland - French version)
