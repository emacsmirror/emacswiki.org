Tip: I like not highlighting the region with visible-mark and allowing marks to override paren highlights. -- [[IanKelling]]

Tip: I find setting a colored underline face less in-your-face than a colored 
background for the visible marks - especially if you're displaying all marks on 
the mark ring.
