== How to get MuMaMo ==
To get %%MuMaMo%% you have to get [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].

Mumamo requires Emacs 22 or later. Mumamo is no longer actively maintained.  See MultipleModes for other multiple-major-mode libraries.

Note: The recommended and supported way to use Mumamo is by loading nXhtml.

= Overview =

mumamo is a library for cooperation of multiple major modes in a buffer.
mumamo divides the buffer into chunks, each with its own major mode.

A description of how mumamo-mode works with this is here:

* http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html#php


In Emacs you normally have only one major mode per buffer.
However especially in web development it is common that a file consists of chunks that corresponds to
different major modes in emacs.

For example a valid HTML file may have chunks that are javascript or css.
And a php file often consists of parts that are HTML and other parts that are php code.
mumamo can find those chunks and help Emacs to handle different major modes for each chunk.

mumamo defines what I call "multi major modes" which you call just as major modes to setup the buffer
(ie find the chunks and assign major modes to them).
Those multi major modes normally have names
like /html-mumamo/, /eruby-html-mumamo/, /django-html-mumamo/, /smarty-html-mumamo/ etc.

If you want to edit for example php files then you can use html-mumamo or nxhtml-mumamo (which is a bit more powerful).

In the out of the box cases above (with main major mode nxhtml-mode) you just load nXhtml (which in turns loads mumamo), open your file and do

  M-x nxhtml-mumamo

nxtml-mumamo-turn on is one of those "multi major modes" I mentioned above.
(You can of course also add nxhtml-mumamo to auto-mode-alist and in fact it is already added to this in nXhtml.)

Instead use launchpad, see [NxhtmlMode nXhtml].

== History ==
The work with %%MuMaMo%% was partly sparkled with my desire for something that could handle
multiple major modes with NxmlMode or its derivatives (like nxhtml-mode, part of [NxhtmlMode nXhtml]) as the main major mode.
%%MuMaMo%% can do that - with what I think acceptible price that fontification is instead handled by html-mode.
(Actually this may look better in many peoples opinion since it uses the same color scheme as the submodes then.)

Another objective was to make it work out of the box for the most interesting combinations.
I have tried to add the most common ones, like html-mode or nxhtml-mode (with submodes CssMode, JavaScriptMode, PhpMode etc), but more suggestions are welcome.
Some %%OpenLaszlo%%, %%Django%%, JSP and Ruby support is now included. I have however not yet got any feedback on the use of them.

In the first version of mumamo there was a minor mode mumamo-mode, but that has now disappeared (it disappeared in nXhtml version 1.10).
Instead there are now multi major modes, like nxhtml-mumamo.
This was an idea that I got from RMS and that has hopefull made mumamo much easier to use.
