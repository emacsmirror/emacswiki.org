BBDB (The Insidious Big Brother Database)

It functions as a complete address book for nearly every email and news client written for Emacs, and its functionality supports (by default) making entries in the address book automatically when reading email or posts by people, and easy lookup of addresses while composing messages.  Additionally some work has been done recently to allow it to sync to a Palm Pilot.

Originally written by JamieZawinski, BbdbMode is now maintained by RobertWidhopfFenk, previously RonanWaide, and many volunteers.  The BBDB 3.0 rewrite was started by RolandWinkler and announced on 2010-05-13.

If you keep elaborate notes on people, consider using MiniEdit to
enter multi-line descriptions, instead of using the minibuffer.

== BBDB 3 and Backwards Compatibility ==

If you plan on updating to BBDB 3, please note that many of the bbdb
functions and variables have been renamed, potentially leading to
broken configurations. For details, see UpgradeBBDB.

For instance, if you have the following hook in
your ~/.emacs:

        (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'bbdb-define-all-aliases)

You will need to change it to:

       	     (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'bbdb-mail-aliases)

Or else message-mode will not set up new mail buffers correctly.

I have detected (I think) that the old function <code>bbdb-address-zip</code> is replaced by the new function <code>bbdb-address-postcode</code>. I need to know the replacements for <code>bbdb-address-location</code> and <code>bbdb-format-streets</code>. Anyone?  (can you reply here: UpgradeBBDB)
