You would have thought that "build-essential" would include autotools but in Ubuntu 12, at least, it does not:

{{{
$ apt-cache depends build-essential
build-essential
 |Depends: libc6-dev
  Depends: <libc-dev>
    libc6-dev
  Depends: gcc
  Depends: g++
  Depends: make
  Depends: dpkg-dev
  Conflicts: build-essential:i386
}}}

Meta-question for you Nic. Reading this, I realize that I have had all the knowledge you just recorded here in my head for some months. I could have written what you wrote, but it never occurred to me, and I feel that it really should have. Do you have some kind of tip or hint to share on when and how to trigger this kind of knowledge sharing?

PhilHudson: Share whenever you find yourself going through pages of search results to find or figure out an answer. Someone else will have the same question - maybe even you, six months down the line. =)

Since the current Emacs includes eww, the list of required packages should also  include libxml2-dev.
