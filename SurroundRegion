Surround the region with a string such as quotes, begin/end:

{{{
(defun surround (begin end open close)
  "Put OPEN at START and CLOSE at END of the region.
If you omit CLOSE, it will reuse OPEN."
  (interactive  "r\nsStart: \nsEnd: ")
  (when (string= close "")
    (setq close open))
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char end)
    (insert close)
    (goto-char begin)
    (insert open)))
}}}
