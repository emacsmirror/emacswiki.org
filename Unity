Emacs makes heavy use of the meta modifier, which is usually mapped to Alt on PC keyboards. Canonical's Unity desktop environment triggers the display of a typeahead menu-item completion feature when alt is pressed, and the two programs do not always work well together. You can move the Unity functionality to a different key by running the "ccsm" utility (apt-get install ccsm) and typing "hud" in the search box; a keybinding widget labeled "Key to show HUB when tapped" should appear; use this widget to change the Unity menubar binding to what you like or to disable it.
