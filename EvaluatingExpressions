This page is about evaluating EmacsLisp '''S-expressions''', or '''sexps'''.  A [[sexp]] is any readable Lisp expression -- code enclosed in parentheses, a string enclosed in double quotes, a variable name, a quoted expression, a numeral, and so on.

See also the sections "How to Evaluate" in the EmacsLispIntro and "Evaluating Emacs Lisp Expressions" in the EmacsManual.

== Evaluating All Code in the Region or Buffer ==

You can evaluate the EmacsLisp code in the [[region]] using `M-x eval-region'.  To evaluate all of the code in the current [[buffer]], mark it using `C-x h', then do `M-x eval-region'.  For information about loading EmacsLisp library files, see InstallingPackages.

=== Inserting Results of Top-level evaluation ===

If you want to evaluate a region and insert the result of each top-level form as a comment (similar to code snippets in the EmacsLispManual), use this:

[https://github.com/lewang/le_emacs_libs/blob/master/le-eval-and-insert-results.el le-eval-and-insert-results.el]

== `C-M-x' - `eval-defun' ==

In Emacs-Lisp mode (e.g., when in a file buffer `##*.el##'), you can use
`C-M-x' (command `eval-defun') which evaluates the defun at point. If 
the [[cursor]] is inside or immediately after a [[variable]] declaration, then this function, unlike `C-x C-e', resets the variable to the value
contained in the declaration.

== `C-h v' - `describe-variable' ==

If you just want to check the current value of a variable, the easiest way is to use `C-h v' (command `describe-variable').  This prints the [[variable]]'s [[doc string]] and [[symbol value|value]].


== `M-x set-variable' ==

You can set [[user option]]s using ‘M-x set-variable’. This can be quicker than evaluating an assignment sexp: `##M-: (setq my-variable some-value)##'.



== `M-:' - `eval-expression' ==

You can evaluate any [[sexp]] using `M-:' (command `eval-expression', by default). 

This prompts you to type a sexp in the [[minibuffer]]. The sexp is evaluated and the result is shown in the [[echo area]] (or inserted into the 
current buffer if you use a [[prefix argument]]). 

This is especially
useful when you are coding and testing. It lets you 
quickly invoke non-interactive functions (non-[[command]]s).  It saves you from typing them into a buffer and using `C-x C-e' to evaluate them.


== `C-x C-e' - `eval-last-sexp' ==

When looking at EmacsLisp code, put the [[cursor]] after a [[sexp]], and hit `C-x C-e' (command `eval-last-sexp').  This prints
the value of the sexp in the [[echo area]].  If you need to look at
the result again later, you can find it in [[buffer]] `*Messages*' (for a while).

You can insert the result of an evaluation into the current buffer at [[point]]
by using a [[prefix argument]]: `C-u C-x C-e'.  This can be useful if you are writing some code that uses the result.





[:PrettyPrintEvalExpression]
== Pretty-Printing for `M-:' and `C-x C-e' ==

Do *one* of these, to make `M-:' pretty-print:

      (global-set-key [remap eval-expression] 'pp-eval-expression)

or for Emacs before 22

      (substitute-key-definition 'eval-expression 'pp-eval-expression global-map)

Do *one* of these, to make `C-x C-e' pretty-print:

      (global-set-key [remap eval-last-sexp] 'pp-eval-last-sexp)

or for Emacs before 22

      (substitute-key-definition 'eval-last-sexp 'pp-eval-last-sexp global-map)

These replace all `global-map' bindings for `eval-'* by the corresponding `pp-eval-'*.  This means that the result of a [[sexp]] evaluation is pretty-printed in a separate [[buffer]], `##*Pp Eval Output*##'. You can edit the definition there, or copy it to other EmacsLisp code.



[:PpPlus]
== Enhance Pretty-Printing Evaluation, `pp-eval-expression' ==

In addition, you can use library '''<tt>[[pp+.el]]</tt>''' to enhance pretty-print evaluation by redefining `pp-eval-expression' as follows:

* Does not use `emacs-lisp-mode-hook'.
* Fontifies the result buffer, `##*Pp Eval Output*##'.
* Makes several EmacsLisp keybindings available while reading the expression -- uses a new keymap, `pp-read-expression-map'. You can use:
** `C-M-q' to indent a sexp
** `C-M-x' to eval a sexp
** `TAB' to Lisp-indent
** `M-TAB' to complete a Lisp symbol
* With a prefix arg, inserts the pretty-printed result in the current buffer. With a negative prefix arg and a string result, inserts it without enclosing double-quotes (`"').
* Respects `pp-eval-expression-print-length' and `pp-eval-expression-print-level', new options that control the print length and print level. Respects standard option `eval-expression-debug-on-error'.

Note: If you use '''[[Icicles]]''', then the same behavior is available in ''Icicle'' mode without library <tt>[[pp+.el]]</tt>.  -- DrewAdams



== Lisp Modes ==

Some people like to use InferiorEmacsLispMode -- `M-x ielm'.  This creates a buffer much like a shell buffer.  Whatever Lisp
expressions you type are evaluated and the result is printed into
the buffer.

Similarly, you can use buffer `##*scratch*##' much as you would a buffer in Emacs-Lisp mode. However, by default the mode of `##*scratch*##' is LispInteractionMode, which is slightly different from Emacs-Lisp mode.  In particular, `C-j' acts quite differently.
