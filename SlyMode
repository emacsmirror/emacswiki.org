[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly Sly] is a fork of SlimeMode that contains multiple improvements, such as:

* it is based on commit mode
* it has backreferences on the REPL
* it alloys another debugging technique with Sly stickers
* multiple REPLs (mrepl)
* etc

The two projects are active, as such Sly should not be seen as a go-to replacement for Slime, one can choose one or the other.
