I started using Emacs back in 1990, after finally getting a working terminal program on our Apple //e (taking over from using ##prompter## (MH) and ##ex##).

These days I use GNU Emacs, often built from Git, mostly on macOS and GNU/Linux (Debian, CentOS, Fedora), although for some reason I recently bought a ThinkPad dual-booting Windows and Linux, so now I can try to wrangle a configuration that works on all three platforms!

I was a Debian developer for several years (back when I was running Debian on a PowerPC Mac clone), but dropped out after my then-new sysadmin job ate my life.  (I'm kind of retired now.)

(Thanks to the folks who suggested alternatives for Mac OS X back when GNU Emacs wasn't quite working for me; I actually tried several of them before going back to GNU Emacs, and I installed Aquamacs for my users for many years.)
