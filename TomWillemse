I'm just another user. I use Emacs. I have been using it for a couple of years now (as of 2007 I think).
Almost everywhere I am I'm (un)known as [::ryuslash], including IRC. I also have [http://ryuslash.org A website].

I've just started two projects in emacs lisp, one a silly theme and the other a silly git thingy.

* [https://gitorious.org/ryuslash/tron-theme tron-theme]
* [https://github.com/ryuslash/git-auto-commit-mode git-auto-commit-mode]

I thought I'd finally add myself here so that I could share this. Plus I've been wanting to do it for a while, never dared.
