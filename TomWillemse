I'm just another user. I use Emacs. I have been using it for a couple of years now (as of 2007 I think).
Almost everywhere I am I'm (un)known as [::ryuslash], including IRC. I also have [https://ryuslash.org A website].

I thought I'd finally add myself here so that I could share this. Plus I've been wanting to do it for a while, never dared.

== Projects ==

; [https://github.com/ryuslash/git-auto-commit-mode git-auto-commit-mode]: A minor mode that tries to commit a file after it is saved.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/yoshi-theme yoshi-theme]: My personal Emacs theme.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/kaarvok kaarvok]: A simple project template sort of thing. Define a template and recreate it many times.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/flycheck-commit-check flycheck-commit-check]: A flycheck checker for my [https://github.com/ryuslash/commit-check commit-check] project.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/dispass.el dispass.el]: An Emacs interface for [http://dispass.babab.nl/all.html DisPass], a much more awesome password manager than all the others.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/eshell-fringe-status eshell-fringe-status]: Inspired by [http://finalterm.org/ Final Term] showing a failed indicator in its margin, I wanted to see the success/failed status of my commands in eshell as well.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/edocs edocs]: An attempt to make writing module documentation simpler by having to write it only once.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/upcase-mode upcase-mode]: An experiment with transient keymaps to lessen the use of the Shift key.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/mode-icons mode-icons]: An attempt to make my mode-line a bit more visual, less textual. And to save space.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/desktop-registry desktop-registry]: A module to turn Emacs' desktop files into a poor man's project file.

=== Unfinished projects ===

These projects are in very early stages of development and are hardly, or not at all, usable.

; [https://github.com/ryuslash/ogi ogi]: An interface between org-mode and github issues. Can only pull in some issues.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/taiga-api-emacs taiga-api-emacs]: A client library for the [https://taiga.io/ Taiga] project management system. Unfinished and just a library, has no user interface.

=== Defunkt projects ===

I don't (really) work on these projects anymore as they're very unlikely to be of much use to me anymore.

; [https://gitorious.org/ryuslash/tron-theme tron-theme]: An early attempt at writing a theme for Emacs. Inspired by the Tron: Legacy movie.
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/transient-navigation transient-navigation]: Something I used before I started using [[Evil]], right after I discovered transient keymaps. Meant to help reduce the effects of Emacs pinky. I don't need it anymore now that I use [[Evil]].
; [https://github.com/ryuslash/desktop-agendas desktop-agendas]: An experiment to integrate org-agenda better with my desktop-registry project.
