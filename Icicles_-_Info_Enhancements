== Icicles Info Enhancements ==

'''Icicles''' can help with InfoMode in these ways:

* '''Icicles''' [[completion]] is available for any input.

* Index-topic completion highlights candidate topics that
reference nodes you have already visited.

* You can create virtual Info books composed of an arbitrary set
of nodes from any set of manuals.

* You can easily find nodes that contain text matching a
combination of patterns.

* You can use `icicle-search' on part or all of a manual, if you flatten it first with `Info-merge-subnodes' .

These features are described below.






[:IciclesCompletionForInfo]
=== Icicles Completion for Info ===

Whenever completion is available for InfoMode [[command]]s, such as `g'
(`Info-goto-node'), `i' (`Info-index'), and `m' (`Info-menu'),
you can take advantage of '''Icicles''' completion.  For instance, if
you type `##g yan##', you can use `S-TAB' for [[apropos completion]] and
choose node `##Isearch Yank##', whose name contains `yan' but does not
start with it.  This is an obvious and standard '''Icicles''' feature.

Although vanilla Emacs also accepts a substring as input for `i',
it does not provide substring or regexp completion, and it will not
accept a [[regexp]] as final input.

''Icicle'' mode binds `g', `i', and `m' to ''[[multi-command]]s''
`icicle-Info-goto-node', `icicle-Info-index', and `icicle-Info-menu', which means that
you can also use `g', `i', and `m' with `C-next', `C-RET', `C-mouse-2',
and so on, to browse among matching Info nodes. Unlike browsing with repeated use of `##,##' after `i' in vanilla
Emacs, you can continue to see all of the matching candidates, in buffer
`*Completions*', and you need not visit the index hits in sequential
order.

If you use '''`M-g'''' in the [[minibuffer]] to toggle
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]]</tt>'''', then you can use just `next'
instead of `C-next' to navigate.  See also [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|More about Multi-Commands]].

As usual in '''Icicles''', you can sort completion candidates in various
ways, using `##C-,##' (`icicle-change-sort-order').  For `g', in particular, although the default order is alphabetical, you can choose '''`in
book order'''', which shows the node candidates in the same order as in the book.
In that case, using `g' and then navigating among candidates
sequentially using `C-down', `C-up', `C-next', `C-prior', `C-end', or `C-home', visits
the nodes in their natural order.

As a special case of this, if you use a negative [[prefix argument]]
(that is, `M-- g'), then not only are the candidate nodes presented
'''`in book order'''', they are also ''limited to the nodes that follow''
your current location in the book -- that is, to the remainder
of the book.  (A non-negative numeric prefix
argument has the same meaning as for `Info-goto-node'.)

In addition, except when you are at the `Top' node, a pseudo-node
'''`##..##'''' is added to the set of completion candidates.  Choosing this
takes you up to the parent of the current node.  You can thus use
'''`g'''' in Info not only to explore nodes by name, but also as another
means to traverse the Info menu hierarchy.










[:HighlightTopicsForVisitedNodes]
=== Highlighting Index Topics for Visited Info Nodes ===

When you are looking for something in an Info manual, `i'
(multi-command `icicle-Info-index') is your friend.  It is
typically better than brute search (`C-s' or `C-M-s'), because a
human has decided what topics to add to the index based on
understanding user/reader needs.

When you use `i' to look up a topic in the indexes of a manual,
you can use completion.  In particular, [[apropos completion]] and
[[progressive completion]] can help here.

Naturally, a single Info node can be indexed under multiple
topics.  And some of those index entries might even represent the
same topic, using different word order or terminology.

Suppose you are looking up information about Emacs fringe, for
example.  You might type '''`##i fringe S-TAB##'''' to see all indexed
topics with the substring `fringe'.  But because of double-entry
indexing, several of the topics matching your input can take you
to the same node.

When you are investigating a topic this way you might want to
visit different nodes that are pertinent to the same topic.  ''But
how can you tell whether you have already visited a node'' that one
of the matching topic candidates takes you to?  '''Icicles'''
highlighting of past inputs does not help here.  What matters is
not whether you have entered a given topic previously but whether
you have already visited a given topic's node.

'''Icicles''' can also help here, by ''highlighting the topics whose nodes
you have visited''.  It uses face
'''`icicle-historical-candidate-other'''' for this (not face
`icicle-historical-candidate').  (This feature is not available
for Emacs 20 or 21.)

This highlighting can be automatic, or you can effect it on demand
using '''`C-x C-M-l''''.  Because it takes extra time to track down each
of the current topic candidates, this highlighting can be costly.
You can customize [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-Info-highlight-visited-nodes|icicle-Info-highlight-visited-nodes]]</tt>'''' to
allow and control automatic highlighting.  It is turned off
(`nil') by default.  Even when the option value is non-`nil',
automatic highlighting does not occur if you turn off historical
candidate highlighting altogether, by setting option
`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag|icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag]]</tt>' to `nil'.










[:VirtualInfoBooks]
=== Virtual Info Books ===

You can take advantage of '''Icicles''' set operations to create your
own ''virtual'' Info books.  That is, you can define and save sets of
Info nodes or Info index entries, and then reuse them later.

Both `m' and `g' in Info use nodes as candidates, so you can use
`m' or `g' or a combination of `m' and `g' to define a node set,
and you can use either `m' or `g' to reuse a node set.  A set of
index entries is different: You must
use `i' to create and reuse such a set.

Remember that you can define a candidate set incrementally,
adding more elements using `##C->##', `##C-)##', `insert', `M-S-mouse-2',
`M-mouse-3', or `##mouse-1 mouse-3 mouse-3##'.  And you can save a
candidate set persistently. [*]

You can even create a virtual book that includes Info nodes from
''different manuals''.  For example, you might want to collect
together specific nodes that deal with some particular topic, such
as faces, from both the EmacsManual and the ElispManual.

You do this using '''`C-u g'''' (a plain prefix argument).  This
prepends the Info file name (book identifier) to each node-name
completion candidate.  For example, when you are in the Emacs
manual, each node candidate is prefixed by `##(emacs)##', and in the
Elisp manual each candidate is prefixed by `##(elisp)##'.  You define a set
of candidates in the usual '''Icicles''' ways, changing manuals as needed to add
additional nodes to the set you save.

A node name prefixed by its file name is analogous to an absolute
file name, that is, a relative file name prefixed by its
directory.  Because such a saved candidate has a book prefix,
e.g. `##(emacs)##', it is absolute and unambiguous.  You can use it
wherever you happen to be in Info, to go directly to that node.
This is a feature of `g' even in vanilla Emacs: you can go to a
node in a different manual from the one you are currently
visiting.

When you want to reuse a virtual book, hit `g' again, retrieve the
saved set of node candidates that defines the book, and navigate
among the saved nodes.

If you use library <tt>[[info+.el]]</tt>, you can also take advantage of its
definition of virtual books and saved Info nodes.  That library
defines command '''`Info-virtual-book'''', which opens Info on a Table
of Contents of a virtual book of nodes that you have saved either
using command '''`Info-save-current-node'''' or by customizing user
[[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#Info-saved-nodes|Info-saved-nodes]]</tt>''''.


'''Icicles''' command '''`icicle-Info-virtual-book'''' extends
`Info-virtual-book' by letting you define the virtual book nodes
using completion.  That is, you can use `g' to save a set of
node-name completion candidates (as the value of variable
`icicle-saved-completion-candidates'), and then use command
`icicle-Info-virtual-book' to open an Info buffer with those nodes
as a menu.

If you have not saved any node-name candidates, then
`icicle-Info-virtual-book' acts the same as `Info-virtual-book':
it opens the virtual book that is defined by '''`Info-saved-nodes''''.  With <tt>[[info+.el]]</tt>, the key '''`##.##'''' adds the current node to
`Info-saved-nodes', which gives you a convenient way to build up a
virtual book as you read.  This is like Emacs [[BookMarks|bookmarking]], but it
keeps your saved Info nodes separate from your other bookmarks.

With a prefix argument, `icicle-Info-virtual-book' lets you choose
a persistently saved completion set to use instead of
`icicle-saved-completion-candidates' or `Info-saved-nodes'.  This
means that you can have any number of such saved node sets as
virtual books, to use at any time.

[* If you click `mouse-1' on a candidate and (starting with Emacs
22) `mouse-1-click-follows-link' is an integer, then you will need
to hold the mouse button depressed longer than that many seconds,
or else that candidate will simply by chosen.  If the value is
`t', then this will not work at all.  Any other value presents no
problem.  (Personally, I use `nil'.)]








[:FindingNodesContainingSomeText]
=== Finding Nodes Containing Some Text ===

In ''Icicle'' mode, `g' (command `icicle-Info-goto-node') lets you
type [[multi-completion]] input whose second part (after `C-M-j') is a
''content''-searching pattern ([[regexp]]).  This means you can search a
set of nodes (or an entire manual) and choose from the list of
matching nodes.  The `*Completions*' candidates you see are just
the node names.

As always during '''Icicles''' completion, you can combine any number of
search patterns (for both node name and content), using
[[progressive completion]].

After you choose one of the matching nodes to
visit, you can use `C-M-s' to find each match of the
content-search pattern.

[:UsingIcicleSearchWithInfo]
=== Using Icicle-Search With Info ===

'''Icicles''' searching (`icicle-search') is not [[Isearch]].
It searches for all matches in the portion of text you tell it to
search.  This means that you cannot use it to search an entire
manual in one operation, unless you have the entire manual
available in a single buffer to be searched.

So, when you use `icicle-search' (`##C-c `##') to search with InfoMode, you
are limited to a few options:

* You can use it normally, to search within a single Info node. 

* You can widen the visible portion of the Info buffer (`C-x n w'), to use it on an
  entire Info file.  However:

## It is not obvious how a given Info manual is divided into
     files.  That is, you need to be aware of the point at which
     the manual moves from one file to the next.

## Only the nodes in the same file that you have already visited
     are highlighted, and lots of ugly Info "plumbing" becomes
     visible in the other nodes.

## You lose all Info features, such as navigation using links.

* There is another way to search across nodes, which addresses #1
  and #2, but still does not give you navigable links and such.
  Think of it as a hack that can sometimes be handy.  That is what
  is described below.

The idea is to ''flatten'' a subtree of Info nodes -- possibly an
entire manual, but more typically a node and its children -- and
then use `icicle-search' (`##C-c `##') over that flattened document.
What is needed is a command that flattens Info subtrees.  '''InfoPlus''' provides such a command, `Info-merge-subnodes', and
binds it to `##+##' in InfoMode.

You can control how you want the flattening to occur, by using
different values of prefix argument.  For searching, you probably
want complete flattening of the chosen subtree, in a single
buffer, so you use a prefix arg of zero: `##C-u 0 +##'.

This does not replace the `*Info*' buffer that you started with; it
creates a new buffer, named after the root node of the subtree you
flattened.  A principle use of `Info-merge-subnodes' is to print
out a manual or a portion of it.  Also, I wrote a library
(<tt>[[mkhtml.el]]</tt>, outdated now) that lets you convert the result to
HTML.

''In sum'', you can use '''Icicles''' search in Info: `##C-u 0 +##', then `##C-c `##'.

One ''caveat'', however: You will generally want to limit your search
to a reasonably small subtree of a manual, instead of flattening
and then searching the entire manual.  Flattening a large manual
can take a while: it took me 10 minutes to flatten the Emacs
Manual.  Of course, you could flatten a large manual once, and
save the result in a file for later searches.

Obviously, flattening in order to search is less convenient than
using manual-wide incremental search (`C-s') with Info (starting
with Emacs 22), and it is often less convenient than using
`Info-search' (bound to `s' in Info).  '''Icicles''' searching is
different from both, and it has its advantages and disadvantages.
When you want the advantages of '''Icicles''' searching in Info, the
flattening hack can be useful.  When you do not need those
advantages, other search methods can sometimes be more
appropriate.
