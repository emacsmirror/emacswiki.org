'''[::Dired]''' is the main mode for Emacs file-manager operations. The name "Dired" stands for "directory editor". 

A single Dired buffer can display the contents of a single directory, or it can include listings of one or more sub-directories. A Dired buffer can alternatively display an ''arbitrary'' set of files and directories, from any file systems.

A Dired buffer can display a filtered subset of directory contents, and it can show either just file names or additional file details.

All the operations you expect from a typical file-manager application are available in Dired, plus some that are specific to Emacs.

You can use '''`C-x C-q'''' to make a Dired buffer editable. This enters [[WDired]] mode (writable Dired). For example, you can use this to bulk-rename files, or to change file ownerships and privileges.

You can operate on multiple files after ''marking'' them. The usual mark is `##*##', but the mark used for deletion is `D'. `D' marks are also called ''flags'', and the operation of marking with `D' is also called ''flagging''.

You visit a directory in Dired mode using key bindings `C-x d', `C-x 4 d', and `C-x 5 d'.

The [[menu bar]] is helpful for learning operations and key bindings. As always, `C-h m' provides information on the mode. Consult the Emacs manual (`C-h r') for more info -- choose ''Dired'' under ''Advanced Features''. You can also read it [[Manual:Dired]] online.)

** In the bookmark list, `##M-d >##' opens Dired on the marked file and directory bookmarks (only).
** In Dired, `C-j' jumps among different "views" or states of the same Dired buffer.
** You can bookmark any Dired buffer -- its current state. Jump among Dired bookmarks using `J' in Dired (or `C-x j d' globally).
** In Dired, `M-b' bookmarks each of the marked files and dirs.
