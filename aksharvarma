Didn't realize importance of case sensitivity for usernames. Made this by mistake. New page has been made, so this should be deleted.


Uses Emacs for almost everything; in love with the self-documentation and interoperability of modes which makes life fun.

* Some of my favorite built-in parts of Emacs include: Ido, Dired, TRAMP, Keyboard Macros, Org+Agenda and most importantly the beautiful self documentation.

* Some packages of note I use from MELPA include: Magit, AUCTex, PDF Tools, Notmuch, Yasnippet.

* Packages I use which improves the Emacs (editing) experience without any significant learning curve. These tend to be among the top downloaded MELPA packages.
** Plug and play: aggresive-indent, beginend, highlight-numbers, hungry-delete, anzu (just the basic stuff is sufficient), undo-tree, which-key, browse-kill-ring, dired-rainbow, volatile-highlights.
** 10-15 minutes for basic usage: smartparens, expand-region, move-text, wgrep, iedit

Have picked snippets from Emacs Wiki for a long time. Had something to add back today (an alternative way to integrate yasnippet with company-mode), so here I am.
