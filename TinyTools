== Overview ==

The "Tiny Tools" is JariAalto's large collection of
small Emacs customizations implemented as one
monolithic package:

* https://github.com/jaalto/project--emacs-tiny-tools (devel site; PRIMARY)
* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/emacs-tiny-tools (devel site; secondary)
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools (documentation)

== Download and Install ==

=== From version control repository (latest code) ===

The latest code can be found from Git version control. Run these commands:

  mkdir -p ~/emacs.d/packages
  cd ~/emacs.d/packages

  # mirror: git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools.git
  git clone git://github.com/jaalto/project--emacs-tiny-tools.git tiny-tools

  cd tiny-tools
  git checkout --track -b devel origin/devel

  #   from time to time, upgrade to latest
  git pull

To install, add this to your <code>~/.emacs</code> InitFile:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/tiny-tools/lisp/tiny")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/tiny-tools/lisp/other")

=== From Savannah snapshot tarball ===

The Savannah contains a link to snapshot tarball, if you prefer it over the Git:

  mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/packages/tiny-tools

  #   cd to directory where you unpacked the tarball
  install -m 644 lisp/tiny/*.el lisp/other/*.el ~/.emacs.d/packages/tiny-tools/

Add following to your Emacs InitFile:

 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/packages/tiny-tools")

 ;; Optional
 ;; (require 'tinypath)

=== Documents ===

Also on the Tiny Tools site, there are a number of documents
written by Jari Aalto about emacs programming issues in general.
While not perfect, and not always up-to-date, these are
often informative, interesting reading for the
beginning-to-intermediate Emacs Lisp programmer:

* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/resources/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/keybindings/
* http://www.nongnu.org/emacs-tiny-tools/font/
