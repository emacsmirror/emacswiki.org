a lot of little things are nice to do with a single function call in emacs.

<pre>
(defun svncmdbuf (cmd &optional fn)
  "run the given svn command on the current window"
  (interactive "scmd:")
  (let
	  ((buf "*svn-cmd*"))
	(if (not fn)
		(setq fn (buffer-file-name)))
	(if (shell-command (format "svn %s %s" cmd fn) buf)
		(switch-to-buffer-other-window buf))))

(defun svndiff ()
  "diff the current buffer with subversion"
  (interactive)
  (let
	  ((fn (buffer-file-name)))
	(if (and fn (shell-command (format "svn diff %s" fn) "*svn-diff*"))
		(switch-to-buffer-other-window "*svn-diff*"))))
	
(defun svn (c)
  "run svn command tool"
  (interactive "c: (a)dd (d)iff (D)iff revision (c)ommit (l)og (r)esolve (R)evert (b)lame (u)p (x)delete")
  (case c
	(?a (svncmdbuf "add"))
	(?b (svncmdbuf "blame"))
	(?d (svncmdbuf "diff"))
	(?D (call-interactively 'sd))
	(?c (svncmdbuf (concat "commit -m \"" (read-string "checkin message:") "\"")))
	(?l (svncmdbuf "log"))
	(?u (svncmdbuf "up"))
	(?r (svncmdbuf "resolved"))
	(?x (svncmdbuf "rm"))
	(?R (if (yes-or-no-p "revert?") (svncmdbuf "revert")))
    (t (message "unknown command key %c" c)
       )
    )
  )
</pre>

For example:
* create a new file, type M-x svn, ?a. and it is added for you.
* want to know what changes you've made? M-x svn, ?d
* revert: M-x svn,?R,?y
* etc.
