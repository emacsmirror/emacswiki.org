== Live-Preview: Mirror buffer changes instantly in the browser ==
moz-reload-mode: http://gist.github.com/442376

[NxhtmlMode nXhtml] also features a MozRepl powered live preview of the edited buffer.
This includes also a possibility to display in the browser point where you are in the editing buffer.

New since some months in nXhtml are the ability to see search matches from isearch and re-builder too. (But this is yet only in the Launchpad repositories for nXhtml and you will need the updated re-builder there.)

This support in nXhtml can however probably be made much better and faster by someone who knows more about javascript. If someone would like to do that it would be very nice.

== Automatically Refresh Browser After Saving HTML/CSS files ==

This snippet triggers a browser refresh every time an .html or .css file is saved in emacs. It uses the emacs MozRepl integration linked to above.

Notes: There is a one-second delay before refreshing the browser. That is set in the: setTimeout(BrowserReload(), "1000"... line. You can change it; it is specified in milliseconds - 1000=1s. 

Also, if you have multiple tabs/windows open it might initially pick the wrong window to refresh - just create a new tab, load the page there and it should start refreshing that tab instead.

<pre>
(defun auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook ()         
          (add-hook 'after-save-hook
                       '(lambda ()
                          (interactive)
                          (comint-send-string (inferior-moz-process)
                                              "setTimeout(BrowserReload(), \"1000\");"))
                       'append 'local)) ; buffer-local

;; Example - you may want to add hooks for your own modes.
;; I also add this to python-mode when doing django development.
(add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook)
(add-hook 'css-mode-hook 'auto-reload-firefox-on-after-save-hook)
</pre>

I suggest using below code,
<pre>
(comint-send-string (inferior-moz-process)
                                           "setTimeout(function(){content.document.location.reload(true);}, '500');")
<pre>
instead of BrowserReload. The difference is this solution won't cache the user input after web page refreshed. 

[new]
Nice, but if you are going to experiment with this it might be good to use a named function in the hook instead of a lambda.
That way you can change it and you can also delete it from the hook if you want to.
