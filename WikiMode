WikiMode gives you a hypertext authoring environment from within
Emacs.

* Lisp:wiki.el

== Questions ==

''I believe that the whole wiki.el is obsolete because its functionality and more is covered in EmacsWikiMode. Am I right?''

No! WikiMode is a MinorMode, EmacsWikiMode is a MajorMode. Sometimes it can be very handy to have a minor mode.

''Is this the only difference between these both?'' - MarcoBakera

No; EmacsWikiMode grew tons of features. -- AlexSchroeder

== Documentation ==

WikiMode treats all text files in certain directories as wiki pages:

Words with mixed case are links you can follow.  If a page with that
name exists, you will be taken there.  If such a does not exist,
following the link will create a new page for you to fill.  Links to
non-existing pages have a `?'  appended so that you can see whether
following the link will give you any informatin or not (such as
SampleUndefinedPage).  In order to follow a link, hit RET when point
is on the link, or use mouse-2.

This makes linking to other pages extremely easy.

All of WikiMode it is customizable, of course.  You can allways change
the rules.  You can allow HTML markup.  You can change how the markup
is translated into HTML.  You can define new markup.  You can
translate the output into something other than HTML.  You can change
what the link pattern.

See the WikiModes for alternatives.

'''Page Summaries'''

The WikiSummary feature adds a meta description tag to all HTML pages
and creates the <nowiki>SiteSummary</nowiki> page.

'''Private Pages and Wiki Projects'''

Should you want to use WikiMode for work to be published and for
private notes, you must take care not to publish your private pages.
WikiProjects helps you do that.

'''Page Language and Spelling'''

Use the WikiLanguage code to set the language attribute of your pages.
There is some WikiSpell code to take advantage of this for ispell,
too.

'''Extended Link Syntax'''

If you like the extended link syntax, there are two extensions you
might want to look at. 

* WikiLink will allow you to use [[URL][name]] to make `name' into a link to URL.
* WikiInter will allow you to use Host:Page to make `Host:Page' a link to an URL previously associated with `Host'.
* OtherWikiLink is a collection of ideas for more linking possibilities.

'''Anchors'''

If you want anchors in your wikis, take a look at WikiAnchor.

'''Producing Link Graphs'''

See WikiDot for lisp code that allows you to parse all wiki files and generate a dot file.  The dot file can then be transformed into graphs by other tools.  The result looks similar to EmacsWikiGraph.

BTW if anybody has managed to get good looking results with WikiDot (I haven't for any nontrivial graphs), please publish the relevant parameters. -- AlexSchroeder

I'm considering to use also a local wiki with Emacs. But I don't know yet which of the four possibilities I should use. (WikiMode, EmacsWikiMode, HowmMode). What is more interesting as a comment here is maybe a nice conversion extension which converts all the Emacs LocalWikiPages into the TouchGraphLinkBrowser XmlFormat could be written. Here is TGLinkBrowser and you need Java: http://www.touchgraph.com/newLB/TGLinkBrowser.html Another interesting point might be having an extension which can convert all Emacs LocalWikiPages into the MindSetCsv format. Here is the MindSetCsv format defintion and for what it can be used: http://www.ms.lt/mindset.html#mindsetcsv (BTW I've written a simple PhpCode which converts the MindSetCsv format into the TGLinkBrowser format so that you can surf all the interconnected KnowledgeBase in the form of a MindSetCsv file (which might come in future also from the local Emacs WikiMode) via the nice TouchGraphLinkBrowser graphical interface.
