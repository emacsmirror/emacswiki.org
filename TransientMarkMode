Transient Mark mode gives you much of the standard selection-highlighting behavior of other editors. In GNU Emacs 23 and onwards, it is enabled by default. Otherwise, to enable it, put the following in your [[init file]]: ##(transient-mark-mode 1)##

In Transient Mark mode, the [[region]] is ''active'' only temporarily, and it is ''highlighted'' while it is active. You activate the region for each [[command]] that uses it: place the [[mark]], then move the [[cursor]] (and [[point]]).

Some features in Emacs support extra behaviors or require it to be on.

* CommentingCode with `M-;'
* SearchAndReplace in a region
* DeleteSelectionMode
* MarkCommands that extend the region on subsequent calls
* OrgMode

Highlighting the region would not be appropriate without Transient Mark mode. Because the region always exists (as soon as the mark exists), without a notion of ''active'' region, some text would always be highlighted (except when mark = point), which would prove to be a nuisance.

In Emacs 22 and later, `C-SPC C-SPC' activates Transient Mark mode only ''temporarily''. This means that even if you do not use Transient Mark mode, you can get the effect of it for the space of one command by doing `C-SPC C-SPC'.

'''See also:'''

* [[Manual:transient-mark-mode]] -- ask the EmacsManual.
* DeleteSelectionMode. Delete Selection mode uses Transient Mark mode. It lets you delete or replace the region just by typing (as in many other editors).
* PcSelectionMode also uses Transient Mark mode.
* ZmacsRegions is the equivalent, in [[XEmacs]], of Transient Mark mode in GnuEmacs.

== Commands that do not work well with Transient Mark Mode ==

=== indent-rigidly (prior to Emacs 23 only) ===

# Set [[mark]] (C-SPC)
# Move the [[cursor]] a couple of [[lines]] down
# C-x TAB

In GnuEmacs prior to Emacs 23, if `transient-mark-mode' is on, the above works only one time.  Consecutive presses of `C-x TAB' beep at you ("The mark is not active now"). 

In order to keep the region highlighted after `C-x TAB' finishes, you can use this advice:

   (defadvice indent-rigidly (after deactivate-mark-nil activate)
     (if (called-interactively-p)
         (setq deactivate-mark nil)))

=== Trouble activating the region at the end of a command ===

[new]
I wrote a small function called `duplicate-region' (see DuplicateStartOfLineOrRegion), and I'd like the mark to be active after calling it.

Transient mark mode is on, I use `push-mark' and `exchange-point-and-mark', (I tried a few other options too) but I can't make it work. Any idea ?

=== How to make C-x C-x turn on highlighting? ===

[new]
How do you make ##C-x C-x## turn on highlighting, without changing anything else?

[new:Anonymous:2018-08-11 15:03 UTC]
What do you mean by *"without changing anything else"*? Doesn't `C-x C-x C-x C-x' do what you are requesting?
