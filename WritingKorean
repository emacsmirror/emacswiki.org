InputMethods - general input method information

These instructions are written with Emacs 22, apparently out of the box. You might need LEIM for Emacs 21.
Type: M-x set-input-method and pick one of

* [[WritingKorean#koreanHangul|korean-hangul]]
** new [[hangul.el|korean-hangul]] input method
* korean-hangul3
* korean-hanja
* korean-hanja-jis
* korean-hanja3
* korean-symbol

[:koreanHangul]

= korean-hangul =

With the input method activated, you will be able to compose characters from the symbols on the [http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/1/1c/Keyboard_Layout_Hangul.png Hangul keyboard]. For a us-ascii keyboard example, type these characters:

* g - ㅎ
* k - ㅏ
* s - ㄴ
* r - ㄱ (this completes the first character and starts the next)
* m - ㅡ
* f - ㄹ
* \C-space - to finish inputing the last character

You should see "한글", which is how you write "Hangul" in, you guessed it, 한글.

This example came from [http://www.learnkoreanlanguage.com/learn-hangul.html learnkoreanlanguage.com]. You will probably need to set your browser's character encoding to EUC-KR to see this page as the server reports "iso-8859-1".


= using korean-hangul3 as default input method =

If you use korean-hangul3 instead of korean-hangul as your default korean input method, you might have to 

   (setq default-korean-keyboard "3")

or

   (setq default-input-method "korean-hangul3")


= Another packages for correct Korean input =


* [[hangul.el]] - by sylphong(see [http://kldp.org/node/91578 kldp.org page(Korean)])
* hanja-util.el

Because Korean characaters are composition of its vowels and non-vowels, there can be huge number of combinations. Due to this, in some coding system, we cannot write such charaters '헿' but '헤ㅎ'. 

And sometimes, in Korean input mode, we cannot input [, ], {,  or } symbols 
with default emacs mule. 

It supports not only emacs' traditional "3 beolsik 390(3벌식390)" in more correct way, but also support "3 beolsik final(3벌식최종)". 

Install it under your lisp path, and do

   (require 'hangul)
   (set-input-method "korean-hangul390") ;; for 3 beolsik 390...
   ;;(set-input-method "korean-hangul3f") ;; if you want 3 beolsik final...
