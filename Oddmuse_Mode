Oddmuse Mode (with a space) is a fork of OddmuseCurl, which in turn is a fork of a very old revision of OddmuseMode.
The naming is unfortunate.

Use it to edit [http://oddmuse.org/ Oddmuse] wikis such as [[Emacs Wiki]].

Cool features:

* [[VersionControl|VC]] integration
* Preview using [[HtmlRendering|shr]]

== Setup ==

A typical setup:

{{{
;;; Oddmuse

(setq oddmuse-username "AlexSchroeder")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/Users/alex/.emacs.d/oddmuse" . oddmuse-mode))
(autoload 'oddmuse-edit "oddmuse"
  "Edit a page on an Oddmuse wiki." t)
(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'oddmuse)
(defun vc-oddmuse-registered (file)
  "Handle files in `oddmuse-directory'."
  (string-match (concat "^" (expand-file-name oddmuse-directory))
		(file-name-directory file)))
}}}

Adding to `vc-handled-backends' and the definition of `vc-oddmuse-registered' would be
part of autoloads, if this file was distributed with Emacs. As it stands, you could
instead ##(require 'vc-oddmuse)##. It's just that I want to keep my Emacs startup speed
down and that's why I don't.
