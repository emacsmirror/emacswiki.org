[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package use-package]] is a declarative way to load packages in your init.el. 

use-package aims to decrease Emacs startup time by loading packages *on use* rather than *on startup*

: I have over 80 packages and things were getting difficult to manage. With this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!

use-package is included as of Emacs 29.1

== Configuration ==

* [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/use-package.html See the Manual]].
* [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/README.md See the README]].
* See ##M-x define-function use-package##.

A simple ##use-package## declaration may look like:

{{{
(use-package dired-x)

(use-package dired
  :bind (("C-c d" . dired-jump)
	 :map dired-mode-map
	 ("/" . dired-omit-mode)
	 ("h" . dired-hide-details-mode)
	 ("-" . dired-up-directory))
  :hook '((dired-hide-details-mode)
	  (dired-omit-mode))
  :config
  (setq
   dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil
   ls-lisp-dirs-first t
   ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program nil))
}}}

It customizes [[Dired]]. With this configuration, ##dired## and its configuration are *not loaded* until ##dired## is called.

The syntax used in this example is explained below:

{{{
(use-package package-name
  :bind   -- A list of global keybindings
    :map  -- A list of local  keybindings
  :hook   -- A list of hooks
  :config -- Variables to set after the package is loaded
}}}
