I just realized that a new logo could play on the similarity between the name of Emacs and E=mc2 :)

At yet it was discussed here, back in 2005:

I'm guessing you read it then, but just forgot about it.  Here's the start of the relativity part of the thread:

Funny, I hadn't heard of "Albert Emacs". Cute.

Hi there! Quick question that's totally off topic.
Do you know how to make your site mobbile friendly?
My blog looks weird when viewing from my iphone4. I'm trying to find a 
template or plugin that might be able to resolve this issue.
If youu have any recommendations, please share. Many thanks!
