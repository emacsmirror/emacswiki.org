[https://github.com/Lindydancer/e2ansi e2ansi] is a package that provides Emacs powered syntax highlighting support for "less" and other command line tools, written by [[AndersLindgren|Anders Lindgren]].

The package provides a command-line tool <tt>e2ansi-cat</tt> that starts Emacs in batch mode, opens files, syntax highlight them (using font-lock), and creates ANSI-colored versions of the syntax highlighted files.

You can integrate this into `less` by setting the following variables to, for example:

    export "LESSOPEN=|emacs --batch -Q -l ~/.emacs -l bin/e2ansi-cat %s"
    export "LESS=-r -j20"
    export MORE=$LESS

The end result looks like the following:

You can vary the colors and attributes like bold, underline, and italics by using a suitable Emacs theme.
