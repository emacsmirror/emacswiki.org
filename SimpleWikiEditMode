The code on this page is *obsolete*. Use OddmuseMode instead. (Also [[Yaoddmuse]]).

----

The code on this page is for a raw wiki browser.  You can
use it for the EmacsWiki, for example!  It uses an extended
SimpleWikiMode for editing.  See WikiModes for an
overview.

[[http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~dhansen/screens/ew.png Large Version]]

Just some words of '''warning''': i started to work on this
project some days ago.  I think i fixed a lot of stuff but
consider the code as ''experimental''.  Even though I'm
currently editing this page with SimpleWikiEditMode my hands
are shaking and i fear to screw the whole page ;-). --
DavidHansen

: Seems to work well now but still not well tested.  Please
  test it especially with pages containing a lot of multi
  byte characters like the Japanese emacswiki.

If you want to extend it for other Usemod wikis, copy
emacswiki-browse as a starting point.  To support other wiki
engines, take a look at usemod-wiki-save and see whether you
can adapt it.

: I haven't touched the code in simple-emacswiki.el and I'm
  sure it is broken at the time.  Have a look at
  simple-wiki-completion.el.  If you want to edit another
  Usemod wiki add it to <tt>swd-wiki-defs-list</tt>.

== Server Side ==

For Usemod wikis, you must install
UseMod:WikiPatches/RawMode so that the wiki script
understands the raw=2 parameter.  (raw=1 only delivers the
plain text, which is enough for viewing, but raw=2 adds a
timestamp cookie on the first line.)

: oddmuse works out of the box

There is a link to the patched script from the EmacsWiki
page. But if your wiki still uses raw=1, you might still be
able to use simple-wiki, if you use (shell-command...w3m) to
fetch pages. (is this right?).  For that:

    (setq swc-pages-get-function 'swc-pages-get-w3m)

:: Well, in fact by using the w3m you build the completion
   on the rendered html page, so you get less garbage than with
   the http-get method. This is not perfect, but it works.

== Download ==

There is currently no release.  The brave may get the code from CVS.

* https://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=http-emacs

Now just add the appropriate directory to your load-path:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "<path to http-emacs>/http-emacs")

Note that the files in the ElispArea only contain a comment
pointing to the Savannah project.  When development started,
these files were hosted in the ElispArea, and only later
were moved to Savannah.

== Entry Points ==

Use the following:

* M-x swc-emacswiki-browse RET <nowiki>PageName</nowiki>RET
  (this is the completion-enabled method)

When editing, type:
* C-c C-m to label your change as minor, type again to undo that.
* C-c C-c to upload your change to the wiki.
* C-c C-/ or C-/ to pcomplete a word a wiki page, ie if there is a page <nowiki>CamelCase</nowiki> on your wiki then typing Came follow by C-/ then Came will be completed <nowiki>CamelCase</nowiki>
  (and the usual M-/ to dabbrev-expand).
* C-c C-f to follow a page at point.



== Keybinding ==

This is what I use:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-o") 'swc-emacswiki-browse)

== User Name ==

When saving a webpage with simple-emacswiki.el, it concatenates
the word of the variable user-full-name to create the
UserName used for the submission.  If you use a different
user name for wikis, get the latest savannah version and
customize `swd-user-name'.

== Simple Wiki Mode -- Quickstart ==

Here's a brief HOWTO.

First add the directory hosting the files in your LoadPath variable
as explained into the Download section.

Then load all the necessary files:

    (require 'simple-wiki-completion)

Feel free to only load stuff you really want to use :) but
note that loading all at the same time doesn't hurt, as long
as you have all the files in your LoadPath.

* Use M-x swc-emacswiki-browse RET
  <nowiki>PageName</nowiki>RET to find pages with completion
  enabled when finding pages.
* When editing, you can enable pcomplete-based completion to
  complete the word at point to a wikipage:


    (add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hook 'pcomplete-simple-wiki-setup)
    (setq pcomplete-ignore-case t) ;; optional

: Thereafter, use C-/ to pcomplete pages at point and M-/ for dabbrev-compltion.

* Type C-c C-m to toggle the labeling of your edit as "minor". The
  default value is "major".  Minor changes are not listed in
  RecentChanges by default.  You need to use one of the
  OtherRecentChanges to list both major and minor changes. Setting
  simple-wiki-minor-p to t will mark all your changes as minor, and
  annoy people to no end.  * There's no real need to softwrap, but
  believe it or not, a lot of people still don't use emacs to edit
  wikis.  So, if you want to make sure that the edit box looks nice
  for these people, too, then you might want to enable the softwrap
  features:


** If your auto-fill-mode is usually on, you might want to turn it off

    (add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hook 'turn-off-auto-fill)

** And now enable LongLines:

   (setq longlines-show-hard-newlines t) ;; optional
   (add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hook
      'longlines-mode-on)
   (add-hook 'simple-wiki-save-before-hooks
             (lambda () (when longlines-mode (longlines-mode-off))))

* Note that on the Emacs Wiki, you should be able to upload
  "filled" pages as well.  Example:

    ** this item
      is continued on the next line.

: looks as follows:

** this item is continued on the next line.

* If simple-wiki does not already detect your username
  correctly when saving a page, customize `swc-username'.

== Renaming Buffers ==

Here is code that renames your buffers.  I use the UNIQUE
argument to rename-buffer so that I get a history of buffers
for a page. Adapt to your liking.

    (add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (when simple-wiki-url
                  (rename-buffer (simple-wiki-page) t))))

Take care that simple-wiki-completion uses a rename hook
named rename-hook.

== Edit Current w3m Buffer ==

Here is some code that lets you edit the emacswiki page
displayed in the current w3m buffer:

    (defvar w3m-emacswiki-url-re
      "^http://www\\.emacswiki\\.org/cgi-bin/wiki/\\(.*\\)"
      "Regular expression to match an emacswiki URL.")
  
    (defun w3m-emacswiki-edit ()
      "Edit emacswiki page displayed in the current w3m buffer."
      (interactive)
      (if (string-match w3m-emacswiki-url-re w3m-current-url)
          (swc-browse "ew" (match-string 1 w3m-current-url))
        (error "Not an emacswiki page!")))

== Importance of the Timestamp Cookie ==

The timestamp on the first line is required to do automatic
conflict resolution using merge(1) -- read the man page for
merge: you need three files to do merging, A, B, and the
common ancestor. The common ancestor is identified by the
timestamp.  If you delete the timestamp, the wiki will
complain.  If you change it, then automatic conflict
resolution might yield suboptimal results.  Nothing you
can't fix by using the normal interface: Click on the "Show
History" link and edit the last good version.

== Blogging ==

Oddmuse (about the only wiki engine really supported by this
mode) as now blogging capabilites. See
Oddmuse:Minimal_Weblog_Setup.

Here is a quick an dirty function that opens a date page of
the wiki from the calendar mode to easily post a new entry.

    (defun swb-insert-entry (arg)
      "get the date page for the date indicated by point"
      (interactive "P")
      (let* ((date (calendar-cursor-to-date t))
	 (month (pop date))
	 (day (pop date))
	 (year (pop date))
         ;date page use ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
	 (page (format "%04d-%02d-%02d" year month day))
	 (nick "myblog")
	 (buffer (get-buffer-create (concat (upcase nick) ":" page))))
       (switch-to-buffer-other-window buffer)
       (swc-browse nick page)))
  
       ;;bind the function to b
       (add-hook 'calendar-mode-hook
	  (define-key calendar-mode-map "b" 'swb-insert-entry))

Note that you need to add my blog in the wiki definitions list

== Future Development ==

* take care of compatibility of different emacs versions
* fix and improve font locking.
* add indentation features

You'are welcome to participate. If you don't know what to do
here is a list of ideas:

* modify simple-wiki-definitions to be more like
  EmacsWikiMode projects
* use emacs-wiki-mode rather than simple-wiki-mode

:: I think simple-wiki-mode is just fine.  May need some
   tuning but supporting the syntax of various wikis sounds
   pretty complicated.

* add a possibility to see recent changes (almost done)
* add search possibilty (needs some patch to oddmuse)
* try to browse other wikis whithout raw mode by filtering
  their edit page (i.e. just diplaying the content of the
  textarea)

:: Media Wiki support would be great but i think this will
   be the same work as writing a complete new package.

In order to allow us to integrate this package into Emacs at
some time, please make sure you are prepared to assign your
copyright to the FSF at some point in the far away future.

TODO: simple elisp functions to access it

=== Coding Systems ===

The last version let you specify the encoding in simple-wiki-definition.

===Questions===

: Has anyone made this work on the latest xemacs?
  specifically for windows.  I get a series of error
  messages and then nothing when I try to load a page.

:: Just made it work on Xemacs 21.4.  You need MuleUCS
   installed. -- DavidHansen


: How do I get this to work for Unicode page names? --[[bkhl]]

:: URL encode the bytes: Schröder -> Schr%c3%b6der. -- AlexSchroeder

::: Still seems to be trouble saving the pages. -- Sunnan

:::: What kind of trouble?  (<i><b>Please</b></i> report bugs to
     mailto:http-emacs-dev@nongnu.org or using one of these
     web forms at savannah)

: Are there any plans to make that process automatic? -- [[bkhl]]

:: I guess DavidHansen could add it to the code...  There
   already is an URL encode defun around. -- AlexSchroeder

: Of course he can :)  <tt>cvs co</tt> latest version.  But
  be careful with non ASCII characters as oddmuse seems to
  have no clue if they are upper or lower case. -- DavidHansen

:: I added support for free links.  It's maybe not a bad
   idea to use them for non ASCII characters.  There may
   happen weird things: ÜmlautLink (won't work as oddmuse
   thinks "Ü" is lower case), Weird∫Link and maybe some more.

: I'm interested in trying to get this to work with a [http://interwiki.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiGateway WikiGateway] backend so as to be able to cleanly support different wiki engines (right now WikiGateway doesn't have comment field setting options, etc, but that will be added..). But I don't know elisp so I need some help :)

: I started out by looking at swd-usemod-wiki-save in simple-wiki-definitions. I'm planning to add a function "swd-wikiclient-wiki-save" which calls the "wikiclient" program (part of WikiGateway).  

: I started by changing the stuff inside "setq proc" (I haven't run it yet, so don't be surprised if there's syntax errors):

<pre>
(defun swd-wikiclient-wiki-save ()
  "Save the current page with wikiclient."
  (let ((url simple-wiki-url)
        (save-func simple-wiki-save-function)
        (link (simple-wiki-save-link))
        (http-version (swd-http-version (swd-nick simple-wiki-url)))
        (content-type (swd-http-coding (swd-nick simple-wiki-url)))
        (headers) (proc))
    (setq proc (shell-command (concat 
			       "../wikiclient --type=usemod1 write "
			       "http://interwiki.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl"
			       ":"
			       simple-wiki-page
			       )))
    (with-current-buffer (process-buffer proc)
      ;; same trick as in `simple-wiki-edit'.  See comment there.
      (set (make-local-variable 'simple-wiki-url) url)
      (set (make-local-variable 'simple-wiki-save-function) save-func)
      (set (make-local-variable 'simple-wiki-time) nil)
      (set (make-local-variable 'simple-wiki-content-type) content-type)
      (set (make-local-variable 'simple-wiki-http-version) http-version))))
</pre>

: (I need to replace "http://interwiki.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl" with whatever the config variable is with the current wiki's root URL)

: So, first question: I need to write "buffer-string" to the STDIN of the "./wikiclient ...." shell command. How do I do this?

: Second question: swd-usemodreal-wiki-save passed a "'swd-usemod-wiki-save-sentinel" to http-post. That sounds scary; do I need to bother with it (since I'm replacing http-post with wikiclient)? And, if so, what the heck is a sentinel and what should I do with it?

: Thanks -- BayleShanks

:: Hi Bayle, don't have much time to answer you but here are some hints:
*  you don't have to set proc in your case as the elisp process is hiden in the shell-command in your case.
* a sentinel is a function that gets called when the process state change (ie stop for exemple)
* in your case you don't need a sentinel as you can execute the process synchronously, ie the function return when the process ends. (that is if you don't put an ampersand & in your command)
* if you need to pass the current buffer as an input to the shell command
use (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max) "my command" ) 
check the help on this function C-h f shell-command-on-region RET


Thanks a lot for your help! Here's the working version (at least, I think it works). This is a patch to  simple-wiki-definitions.el which makes it use the external program "wikiclient" to save a page to the wiki. The next step is to allow the --type argument to assume different values, which will enable the program to interact with various different WikiEngines (whatever is supported by WikiGateway; currently OddMuse, UseMod, and MoinMoin):

<pre>
(defun swd-usemod-wiki-save ()
  "Save the current page with wikiclient."
  (let ((url simple-wiki-url)
        (save-func simple-wiki-save-function)
        (link (simple-wiki-save-link))
        (http-version (swd-http-version (swd-nick simple-wiki-url)))
        (content-type (swd-http-coding (swd-nick simple-wiki-url)))
        (headers) (proc))
    (shell-command-on-region 
     (save-excursion (goto-line 2) (line-beginning-position)) 
     (point-max) 
     (concat 
			       "wikiclient --type=oddmuse1 write "
			       link
			       ":"
			       (simple-wiki-page)
			       ))
))
</pre>

So, how to cookies for use with this mode? For editor
passwords, I mean. I'm guessing I should use http-cookies.el, but how?
-- [[bkhl]]
:: well a cookie is some bytes added to the header, so you will have to find what to send, fix http-post because I think it doesn't send additional headers as it is now and then modify simplewikiedit so you can add your extra cookie header....

I'm having trouble getting SimpleWikiEditMode to post data. I've got the following lines in my .emacs:
<pre>
(setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/http-emacs" load-path))
(require 'simple-wiki-completion)
(require 'simple-ecwiki) ;; copy of simple-emacswiki.el edited
                         ;; for my oddmuse wiki
(require 'simple-emacswiki)
(add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hooks 'pcomplete-simple-wiki-setup)
(setq pcomplete-ignore-case t) ;; optional
(add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hooks 'turn-off-auto-fill)
(add-hook 'simple-wiki-edit-mode-hooks
	  (lambda ()
	    (when url
	      (rename-buffer (let ((simple-wiki-url url))
			       (simple-wiki-page)) t))))

</pre>
I get the same end results regardless of whether or not the add-hook lines are commented out. The result is that on sending the updated page, the buffer changes to read:
: Please go on to SandBox.

The buffer name doesn't change, nor does the mode change at all. And when I browse out to the updated page--in this case SandBox--I find that I <em>do</em> have a new revision, but it is quite blank. If there had previously been data in the page prior to editing it with SimpleWikiEditMode it is wiped out.

I'm using Gnu Emacs 21.3.1 on Debian. And I'm using the CVS packages from Savannah.

[new]
Does SimpleWikiEditMode work with the latest xemacs? does it work on windowsxp? At least the way I have it set up it seems like it can't fetch pages properly.  Has anyone made it work?  -JoeCoffey 

[new]
Does anybody interested in other wiki markup rules? I've slightly modified simple-wiki.el adding TWiki support and improving MediaWiki syntax highlighting. Also I'm going to add WikiText support (used by http://www.wikispaces.com). -- DmitriBrechalov

[new]
Doesnt work for me. when i type M-x swc-emacswiki-browseRET i get:
Wrong type argument: listp, "close"

this is what i load:
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/http-emacs")
(require 'simple-wiki-completion)
