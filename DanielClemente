I enjoy/suffer GNU Emacs daily since May 2007.

I think it fits very well in the GNU project. It gives me the freedom to (1) use it, (2) study it, (3) improve it and (4) distribute it as I want, without limits. Not only you have the freedom to do this, but it also //encourages// you to do it: 
# The big repertoire of functions probably satisfies most of your usage needs. 
# All functions embed their documentation, you can browse it inline, most are written in Lisp and are also made of self-documented components. 
# Just „configuring“ Emacs is equivalent to programming Emacs. And people love configuring their Emacs.
# There are lots of places to share Emacs Lisp code, and it is a very common practice.

I am interested in software quality and usability, and while I think that Emacs is in general stable, I also see that it suffers many shortcomings.
* Most useful things are off by default, and users don't notice it
* Little documentation for many complex functions
* Rudimentary development tools: no normal and easy-to-use bug/patch tracker (after 30 years!); [s]repositories still with CVS[/s]; the main tool is just a mailing list with many off-topics and sometimes heated discussions; no automated testing
* Delayed inclusion of common features; too long release cycles
* Only available in 1 language
* Little effort on usability and on what the users need. Many usual and reasonable tasks don't come optimally preconfigured; ex: working shell, IDE, HTML editor, ...
* Many people don't recognize the need of improvement and think for instance that it's normal to spend many days just to configure your e-mail

I'd like to try to fix this type of problems.
For instance, moving people to take part in GoogleSummerOfCode 2009 in GNU Emacs, which is a good opportunity to tackle the big projects... because you have a mentor, some objectives to achieve, an evaluation at the end, and progress tracking. This is hard to obtain individually, specially in a project without roadmaps like Emacs.

Until now, I improved some documentation: [[FloatingPoint]], symbol glossary at [[CategoryGlossary]], [[GnusGmail]], [[GnusEncryptedAuthInfo]], [[GnusSpeed]], [[EmacsLispReference]], [[FakeClosures]], [[EmacsMemoryDebugging]], [[GnusDemon]], [[GnusNotify]], … and did content reorganization and maintenance (ex: at [[JavaDevelopmentEnvironment]], [[JdeeVsEclipse]]). I'm writting also my first patches while I learn [[EmacsLisp]].

I use GNU Emacs, [[OrgMode]], [[Wanderlust]], [[Helm]], [[emacs-w3m]], [[OrgMode]], [[Rcirc]], [[JabberEl]].

I'm user <code>clemente</code> in [[EmacsChannel]]. My web site is at http://www.danielclemente.com/
My configuration is at https://www.danielclemente.com/emacs/confi.html

I want to export my org-mode notes to WWW but I'm finding a lot of questions; I'll document them at https://www.danielclemente.com/hiper/
