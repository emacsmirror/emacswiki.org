: "sometimes i feel like we're making emacs better and better because we don't know what to do with emacs once it is finished." -- AlexSchroeder on InternetRelayChat

Click the heading to search for all pages belonging to the writing
of Lisp code.  These pages contain information for would-be authors of
new major and minor modes: EmacsLisp style, coding conventions,
pointers and documentation to existing features.  What follows are
some suggestions; find more other pages by searching for
backlinks via the heading.

Before you get starting diving into Emacs Lisp, it's a good idea to be
aware of some EmacsLispLimitations.  Once upon a time I thought I
wanted to use Emacs Lisp for all of my coding needs, but then
rediscovered the old truism: some languages are better suited for some
tasks. -- JohnWiegley
