* [[Alex Schroeder]]'s [https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/emacs-setup/about/ Emacs Setup]
* [[DirkJanBinnema]]'s [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/dot-emacs.html init file]

* [https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven FabriceNiessen's .emacs] is huge, well-commented and excellent. You can find something interesting there
* https://github.com/glasserc/ethan-wspace
* JesseWeinsteinDotEmacs has some Mac OS X initialization that might be interesting
* John Zaitseff's [https://www.zap.org.au/~john/emacs/.emacs .emacs] and [https://www.zap.org.au/~john/emacs/.Xresources .Xresources] files contain almost 2600 lines of code and settings tuned for Emacs under X11, the Linux console, Windows, macOS and even old terminals...  These files contain a theme very reminiscent of the old Borland IDE tools
* [https://github.com/mina86/dot-files/blob/master/emacs/init.el mina86â€™s init.el] with almost 2k lines of elisp code. Tested mostly with GNU Emacs from CVS but should work with other versions

* [http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs/ StefanReichoer's .emacs] is HUGE and runs on Windows and Unix platforms

[:adding-example-emacs-configuration]
== Adding an example Emacs Configuration ==

When adding a new Emacs configuration to this page, please bear in mind the following:

# Lists are alphabetically sorted by /author/
# List items do *not* end with a period
# Add the config to the appropriate section; if it uses OrgMode to generate the main configuration files, 
then link it in [[#OrgModeConfigs]], otherwise add it to [[#OtherConfigs]]
# Please start the item with the name of the author, to help with the alphabetical ordering
# Please add a brief summary; every Emacs configuration is different, why might someone want to look at this one?
