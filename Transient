Transient ([https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/transient.html Emacs manual], [https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html ELPA], [https://melpa.org/#/transient MELPA], [https://github.com/magit/transient GitHub]) is a package used to implement keyboard-driven “menus”.  Originally developed for [[Magit]], it has been built into Emacs since version 28.

From the code comments: "When the user calls a transient prefix command, then a transient (temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
are added to `pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook'.  The available suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in the echo area until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix command."

Transient is unrelated to TransientMarkMode.

== Demonstration ==

You can define a simple transient menu like so:

{{{
(defun my-message ()
  (interactive)
  (message "meow uwu"))

(transient-define-prefix test-transient ()
  "A demo transient menu."
  [["First Group"
    ("a" "action a" my-message)
    ("b" "action b" my-message)
    ("c" "action c" my-message)]
   ["More Actions"
    ("x" "Do X"     my-message)
    ("y" "Do Y"     my-message)
    ("z" "Do Z"     my-message)]])

(test-transient)
}}}

First we define ##my-message##, which just prints text to the minibuffer. Then we define a popup menu with ##transient-define-prefix##, every selection in which runs the same function.

* ReadMultipleChoice is also built-into emacs and is a lighter, similar interface for making quick single-char selections.
