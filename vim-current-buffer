A simple elisp function to call vim to open and edit current buffer. 

Instructions: Please change the path of vim/gvim to where it is on your computer.
 - Todo: re-open the edited file in Emacs, after opening it in vim.
 - Alternative solution for vi-like editing solution (ipstone's current favorite): [toggle-viper-keychord] setup for seamless toggle [Viper] mode and [keyChord] mode
