God mode ([https://melpa.org/#/god-mode MELPA], [https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode GitHub]) is "is a global minor mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys. It's similar to Vim's separation of command mode and insert mode.  All existing key bindings will work in God mode. It's only there to reduce your usage of modifier keys."

== Integration with input method ==

god-mode is not working well with InputMethods, when the mode is enabled and the method is toggled on, the mode can't recognize the keys.
The workaround is to enable input methods only when the mode is disabled:  
{{{
(defvar my-input-method-was-enabled nil)

(defun my-input-method-on ()
  (when (and 
         (equal nil current-input-method)
         (not (equal nil my-input-method-was-enabled)))
    (progn
      (toggle-input-method)
      (setq my-input-method-was-enabled nil))))

(defun my-input-method-off ()
  (when (not (equal nil current-input-method))
    (progn
      (toggle-input-method)
      (setq my-input-method-was-enabled t))))

(add-hook 'god-mode-disabled-hook 'my-input-method-on)
(add-hook 'god-mode-enabled-hook 'my-input-method-off)
}}}
