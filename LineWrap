==Flavors of line-wrapping==

===Default===
By default, Emacs wraps a line that reaches the window width, either displaying a backslash (`\') in the buffer or placing a bent arrow (&#x21a9;) in the window [[fringe]].  This happens at character-level, not respecting word boundaries. The buffer text is not changed.
===Truncating===
To truncate lines rather than wrapping them, use TruncateLines.
===Visual-Line mode===
VisualLineMode wraps a line right before the window edge. The buffer text is not changed.
====Visual-Fill-Column mode====
VisualFillColumn (used in concert with VisualLineMode) wraps a line after the last word before `fill-column'. The buffer text is not changed.
===Filling===
This refers to breaking lines by characters, i.e. changing the buffer text.  See CategoryFilling for how to do this.

==Enabling word-wrapping==
===Basic word-wrapping===
To use word-wrapping for continuation lines, set `word-wrap': i.e., ##M-: (setq word-wrap t)##, or placing it as a file variable ##-*- mode:blah ; word-wrap:t -*-## in your first line. 
===Word-wrapping by category===
Emacs 28 provides the variable ##word-wrap-by-category##.  This is off by default.  Setting it is useful for word-wrapping with CJK characters.

It can be used to customize where wrapping occurs.  For example, running

    (progn
      (modify-category-entry '(45 . 47) ?|)  ;; ASCII 45-47, i.e. ",-/"
      (modify-category-entry 58 ?|)          ;; ASCII 58, i.e. ":"
      )

will make the characters in ",_/:" act as word-wrapping boundaries, which may be helpful when displaying long URLs.

== Changing the line-wrap character ==
To disable the `##\##' character in line wrapping (copying from Emacs in a terminal can copy the character), remove it with a trick that is not well documented:

  M-: (set-display-table-slot standard-display-table 'wrap ?\ )

Notice that after the `##\##'  there is a whitespace character but you can use other characters.
==Adaptively setting prefixes for wrapped lines==
See AdaptiveWrap.
==Specialist support==
===Mail===
Mail read or written within Emacs can take advantage of FormatFlowed
===Org mode===
OrgMode's `org-startup-indented' supports setting the line prefixes to use when wrapping similarly to AdaptiveWrap, as described at http://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-view.html#Clean-view
