'''Unit tests''' are supplementary source code created to automatically test the functionality and correctness of code modules. They are a way of formalizing assumptions about the code's behavior. With unit tests, one can validate code and code changes at any time, and know exactly when a new change breaks existing code.

This page discusses unit testing of EmacsLisp scripts and programs.

== Terminology ==

A '''unit test''' is a piece of a code that checks the correctness of some other code. In Emacs Lisp, meaningful "units" to test are functions, commands and macros.

Various '''testing frameworks''' simplify the task of writing and running tests. The following terms are commonly encountered:

* '''Assertion:''' a statement that verifies that something is true. In <tt>[CommonLispForEmacs cl]</tt>-extended Elisp, ##(assert (= (+ 2 2) 4))## verifies that "2 + 2 = 4"; if it wasn't (the comparison returned ##nil##), ##assert## would signal an error.
* '''Test:''' a function that executes one or more assertions in order to verify assumptions about a code unit. A common approach is to feed certain values into the unit and compare the output with expected output. If there is a discrepancy, the assertion signals an error and the test fails.
* '''Test suite:''' a collection of tests. Grouping tests may be useful for separating time-consuming tests from the rest. (The object containing the tests is sometimes called the "test case" or "test harness".)
* '''Mock/stub:''' a stand-in for actual code, useful for "stubbing out" external behavior. (Roughly speaking, mocks and stubs do the same thing, but mocks are more sophisticated.) A mock function for, say, "##download-webpage##" may return an appropriate value without actually connecting to the Web.
* '''Fixture:''' setting up (and tearing down) an environment for a test or a test suite.
* '''Regression test:''' a test that exposes a bug, thereby validating the bugfix. If the bug should reappear, the test will detect it.
* '''Test-Driven Developent''': a methodology that emphasizes continual testing as part of the "development cycle".

The precise meanings of these terms may vary, though there is some commonality among [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit xUnit]-like frameworks (like SUnit for Smalltalk, JUnit for Java, and lisp-unit for Common Lisp).

== Frameworks ==

The following unit test frameworks exist for Emacs Lisp.

=== Included with Emacs ===

'''ErtTestLibrary''' -- Elisp Regression Testing (ERT) by Christian M. Ohler is now included in Emacs. The framework provides facilities for defining and running test suites, reporting the results, and debugging test failures interactively.

=== xUnit-like ===

'''ElkTest''' by Nikolaj Schumacher is inspired by JUnit for Java. It provides visual feedback with [[FringeHelper|fringe-helper.el]] and a number of specialized assertion macros like ##assert-equal##, ##assert-nil##, etc.

'''ElUnit''' is an experimental framework by PhilHagelberg. It is inspired by [http://panix.com/~tehom/my-code/regress.el regress.el], Ruby's ##Test::Unit## framework and xUnit, and provides test suites and fixtures. It is deprecated in favor of ##ert.el##.[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/122304]


'''[[http://github.com/rocky/emacs-test-simple|test-simple.el]]''' is intended to be
* Simple -- no need for ''contexts'', ''specifications'', or ''test tags''. But if you want, you still can add custom assert failure messages or add notes before a group of tests.
* Facilitate interactive use with ##eval-last-sexp##, ##eval-region##, and ##eval-buffer##
* Allow running non-interactively

I use this my Debugger front-end https://github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr

=== Behavior Driven Development ===

'''[[EmacsLispExpectations|el-expectations.el]]''' by [[rubikitch]] is a small framework focusing on simplicity and readability. It is modeled after [http://expectations.rubyforge.org Ruby expectations] (for example, ##(expect 4 (+ 2 2))## verifies "2 + 2 = 4") and works with '''[[EmacsLispMock|el-mock.el]]''', a DSL-based mock/stub framework.

'''[[ETest]]''' (Emacs Testing Framework) by Phil Jackson allows arbitrary nesting of tests. It also works with [[EmacsLispMock|el-mock.el]]. [http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/content/etest.html Manual].

PhilHagelberg describes a BDD framework with expectations-like syntax. [http://technomancy.us/73 Description].

[https://github.com/ecukes/ecukes ecukes] is a cucumber-like framework for writing tests. It allows you to write human-readable feature tests. 

=== Others ===

'''[[EmacsLispForRuby|El4r]]''' (Emacs Lisp for Ruby) leverages Ruby's ##Test::Unit## framework by using the EmacsRuby extension language. You write unit tests in EmacsRuby, while the code is in EmacsLisp. In other words, you can treat the EmacsLisp code as a black box and feed it inputs and check the outputs using EmacsRuby.

'''[[Emtest]]''' is a modular, extensible testing framework. It supersedes [http://panix.com/~tehom/my-code/regress.el regress.el], also by [TomBreton Tom Breton]. It lives in [http://savannah.nongnu.org/git/?group=emtest a git repo] on Savannah.

'''[http://www.wanglianghome.org/svn/test/test.el test.el]''' is developed for testing operations on a buffer (but can also be used to test operations unrelated to buffers). [http://www.wanglianghome.org/images/test.png Screenshot].

'''[[Lisp:unit-test.el|unit-test.el]]''' by MarkTriggs reports the pass/fail status of your unit tests (in any language). You need to define a function that runs your unit tests and returns non-##nil## if they pass. Depending on the output, it will display green or red "light" graphic icon (##xpm##) on the Emacs window mode line.
== Without a framework ==

To sprinkle your code with tests, wrap them in ##eval-when-compile##:

    (eval-when-compile
      ;; unit test code
      ...)

Then, when you byte-compile the file, the test code is executed; when you load the file, it is not. A more flexible approach is to define a ##run-my-tests## variable and set it to ##t## during compilation:

    (defvar run-my-tests nil)

    (eval-when-compile
     (setq run-my-tests t))

    (when run-my-tests
      ;; unit test code
      ...)

That compiles the test code too, and the ##run-my-tests## variable is evaluated a lot when loading the file. But since all the tests are skipped when loading, the compiled ##.elc## files are still much faster than the uncompiled ##.el## files.

=== Assertions ===

Assertions can be made with the ##assert## macro from <tt>[CommonLispForEmacs cl.el]</tt>:

    (assert (= (+ 2 2) 4))
    (assert (/= (* 2 3) 5))

Remember to load ##cl.el## with ##(require 'cl)##.

=== Tests ===

Assertions can be grouped into tests with ##defun##:

    (defun my-test-arithmetic ()
      (assert (= (+ 2 2) 4))
      (assert (/= (* 2 3) 5)))

=== Test suites ===

Tests can be grouped into test suites with ##add-hook##:

    (defvar my-test-suite)
    (add-hook 'my-test-suite 'my-test-arithmetic)

To run the suite:

    (when run-my-tests
      (run-hooks 'my-test-suite))

=== Mock functions ===

Functions can be temporarily rebound with ##flet## from <tt>[CommonLispForEmacs cl.el]</tt>:

    (defun my-test-division ()
      (flet ((/ (dd ds) 0))
        (assert (= (/ 1 0) 0))))

The above will suppress an ##arith-error## when dividing by ##0##.

For more complex scenarios, [https://github.com/sigma/mocker.el mocker.el] is a layer on top of ##flet## that supports programmable mock functions.

=== Fixtures ===

While fixtures are a great syntactic simplification in other languages, they are not very useful in Lisp, where higher-order functions and ##unwind-protect## are available. One approach is

    (unwind-protect
        (progn
          ;; Set up ...
          (my-test-arithmetic))
      ;; ... tear down
      )

The [https://github.com/ohler/ert/blob/bc51e3e8121d51dc88618847f0958e7ec832c7d2/doc/misc/ert.texi documentation of ert.el] sketches out a more general solution.

== Discussion ==

That there is so much interest in this looks great, but could please someone start making a comparison of the different approaches? What does they support? How easy are they to use? Could more simple packages be built upon more general packages? Etc.

[new:stepnem:2011-06-17 14:30 UTC]
Indeed. Given that ERT is now part of GNU Emacs, I think particularly helpful would be if people who know and like other test frameworks summarised the differences, what they percieve as missing from ERT etc., so other people can make up their mind as to whether to stick with it or not, or push for improvements to ERT being accepted by the maintainers.

[new]
One question: do any of these packages support TAP (the [http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Test Anything Protocol])? I don't see a single reference to it.

[new:rocky:2012-06-15]
In short order I added optional TAP output to '''[[http://github.com/rocky/emacs-test-simple|test-simple.el]]'''. However after doing that I realize you are not going to be able to use ''prove'' unless one creates a custom Test::Harness. Open an issue on the github page if this is worth pursuing.

[new]
Does anybody know any mock or stub frameworks in Emacs Lisp? Because many Emacs Lisp functions have side-effects, a mock / stub framework is essential to unittest in Emacs Lisp. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new]
I intended to create ##mock.el##, but I didn't yet ... [[Matsuyama]]
