When automatic indentation is enabled, upon entering new line Emacs
will put the cursor under the first non-blank character of the
previous line. Because it is not designed to handle virtual spaces,
Emacs will do that by inserting the necessary amount of white-space
characters (tabs or spaces) so that the cursor can be positioned at
the desired location. The problem is that *if nothing is typed* at that
line, the block of spaces are *left hanging forever*.

For example, with auto-indentation enabled attempt to insert one blank
line between the two printf() lines. On the screenshot the cursor is
at the end of the first line.

The natural inclination is to simply press RET.

New line is inserted. Now walk away by pressing down arrow.

The trailing white-space area is highlighted in red.

There are solutions already built in Emacs. These spaces
can be removed by invoking M-x `delete-trailing-whitespace', or even
making it automatic by attaching to `before-save-hook'.

The problem is that in such configuration all white spaces, including
*those from lines you didn't edit*, will be deleted. This is
inadmissible in an environment of collaborative development where one
central version control repository is shared. Your commits
*will have tons of unrelated changes*.

`clean-aindent.el' is a small extension that keeps track of the last
auto-indent operation and, if it is abandoned,
*would take care to trim down the abandoned white space* characters.

It will look like this after the line is abandoned:
