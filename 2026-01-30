I'm going to add yet another layer of defence to the wiki.

Sadly, the wiki has been down a lot. I think it's the AI bots that are trying to use Emacs Wiki to train the large language models of their masters.
These requests are hard to defend against. I have a gazillion [https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks bookmarks] on the topic -- the article [https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face] by Drew DeVault is a starting point I recommend. If you want to learn more about the endless struggle, take a look at the [https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Butlerian_Jihad Butlerian Jihad] section of my blog. And if you're just interested in the technical aspects of it all, I documented [https://transjovian.org/view/fight-bots/index the setup].
But it's not enough.

So here's a new idea: When load goes up, the entire wiki is password protected -- even for reading. I know, that's terrible. But perhaps it'll help us through the times when the scrapers effectively execute a distributed denial-of-service attack on the wiki.

!!Should you be greeted by a login prompt, use **username** "alex" and **password** "secret".!! Yeah, it's as silly as that. If you fail to answer correctly, the error message will remind you of the username and password. Just to be sure.

The way it's going to work for the moment is that every 20 minutes a job will check if average server load is higher than 10. If so, a password is required. And then, 20 minutes later, if the situation is better, the check is removed again. There's a write-up, [https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2026-01-30-lock-the-gate on my blog]. I'm going to fiddle with it some more.

I'm sorry it has come to this.
