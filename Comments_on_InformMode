Just a note, the 'MooMode'page linked here doesn't exist so far, and the MushMode page contained a link to different version of RMOO than was listed in comments (now deleted) on this page.  I moved the link to that page, but thinking about whether 'MooMode' should be created or if it's unnecessary hair-splitting.
