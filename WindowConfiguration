A window configuration is the layout of the various [[window]]s in an Emacs
[[frame]].  Such a window configuration can be stored in a [[register]]
(see WindowsAndRegisters) and in a history of window configurations, allowing you to undo changes
or redo changes to the window configuration.

* Saving and restoring window configurations -> WindowsMode, PolicySwitch
* Switching back and forth between configurations -> WinnerMode
* Storing them in registers and restoring them from there -> WindowsAndRegisters 
* Saving and loading of window configurations, animated window configuration morphing -> WorkgroupsForWindows

The most basic changes to the window configuration are listed on
[[Window]].
