This page is about ''displaying'' line numbers in a buffer, or otherwise indicating line numbers, ''without'' actually changing the buffer content. If you just want to work on a specific part of the file and you are accustomed to doing that by showing line numbers in the margin, try BasicNarrowing instead.

'''See Also:''' NumberLines will add the line numbers to the buffer content.

===Display line numbers for every line===
##display-line-numbers-mode## is available since Emacs 26.  For older Emacs, see the section below on ##linum-mode##.

You can enable it globally by appending this to your ##.emacs## file:

<pre>
(when (version<= "26.0.50" emacs-version )
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode))
</pre>

To disable it in certain major modes you can redefine ##display-line-numbers--turn-on##:

<pre>
(require 'display-line-numbers)

(defcustom display-line-numbers-exempt-modes
  '(vterm-mode eshell-mode shell-mode term-mode ansi-term-mode)
  "Major modes on which to disable line numbers."
  :group 'display-line-numbers
  :type 'list
  :version "green")

(defun display-line-numbers--turn-on ()
  "Turn on line numbers except for certain major modes.
Exempt major modes are defined in `display-line-numbers-exempt-modes'."
  (unless (or (minibufferp)
              (member major-mode display-line-numbers-exempt-modes))
    (display-line-numbers-mode)))
</pre>
=== Display the current line number in the mode line===
Use <code>M-x line-number-mode</code>.

=== Display the current line number once===
To display the current line number in the EchoArea, you can
* use <code>M-x what-line</code> command
* use <code>count-lines-page</code> (<kbd>C-x l</kbd>), which reports the total number of lines as well as the numbers of lines before and after the current one.

=== Linum mode===
Obsolete from Emacs 29, see LinumMode.

==XEmacs line-numbers-mode==

JerryChen had [http://www.geocities.ws/gchen275/xemacs/ a line-numbers-mode on Geocities]. It seems to be [[XEmacs]] specific.
