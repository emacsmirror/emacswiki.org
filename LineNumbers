This page is about ''displaying'' line numbers in a buffer, or otherwise indicating line numbers, ''without'' actually changing the buffer content. If you just want to work on a specific part of the file and you are accustomed to doing that by showing line numbers in the margin, try BasicNarrowing instead.

'''See Also:''' NumberLines will add the line numbers to the buffer content.

===Display line numbers for every line===
##display-line-numbers-mode## is available since Emacs 26.  For older Emacs, see LinumMode and [[Nlinum]].

You can enable it globally by appending this to your ##.emacs## file:

<pre>
(when (version<= "26.0.50" emacs-version )
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode 1))
</pre>

Alternatively, to use it only in programming modes:

    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'display-line-numbers-mode)
=== Display the current line number in the mode line===
Use <code>M-x line-number-mode</code>.

=== Display the current line number once===
To display the current line number in the EchoArea, you can
* use <code>M-x what-line</code> command
* use <code>count-lines-page</code> (<kbd>C-x l</kbd>), which reports the total number of lines as well as the numbers of lines before and after the current one.

=== Linum mode===
Obsolete from Emacs 29, see LinumMode.

JerryChen had [http://www.geocities.ws/gchen275/xemacs/ a line-numbers-mode on Geocities]. It seems to be [[XEmacs]] specific.
