This page is about ''displaying'' line numbers in a buffer, or otherwise indicating line numbers, ''without'' actually changing the buffer content. If you just want to work on a specific part of the file and you are accustomed to doing that by showing line numbers in the margin, try BasicNarrowing instead.

'''See Also:''' The code on this page just ''displays'' line numbers without actually changing the buffer content. NumberLines will add the line numbers to the buffer content.

== The Easy Way ==

##M-x linum-mode##

It could slow down emacs when viewing file with more than tens of thousands of lines. See https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/issues/178 for bug report and solution.

== The Current Line Only ==

If you just want the current line number in your modeline (and it isn't there already), use [::LineNumberMode] by running the <code>M-x line-number-mode</code> command.

If you just want to know the current line number that the TextCursor is on, you can use the <code>M-x what-line</code> command (which is usually not on a key).  Or use <code>count-lines-page</code> (<code>C-x l</code>) that reports the total number of lines as well as the numbers of lines before and after the current one.

== XEmacs line-numbers-mode ==

JerryChen had [http://www.geocities.ws/gchen275/xemacs/ a line-numbers-mode on Geocities]. It seems to be [[XEmacs]] specific.
[http://www.geocities.ws/gchen275/xemacs/line-numbers-mode.gif Screenshot].

== line-num ==

[[line-num.el]]

== LinumPlus ==
LinumPlus


== NLinum ==

The ##nlinum.el## library, available from GNU ELPA (http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/nlinum.html) is meant as a replacement for linum.el, using the jit-lock infrastructure to fix various corner case bugs in linum.el.  It should usually be about as fast or faster than linum.el.

To precalculate the line number width to avoid horizontal jumps on scrolling:
<pre>
;; Preset width nlinum
(add-hook 'nlinum-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq nlinum--width
              (length (number-to-string
                       (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))))))
</pre>

== Linum ==

Library ##linum.el## works incrementally and can number large files very quickly.

http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225855/linum/linum.html

##linum.el## is distributed with Emacs in versions after 22 (currently only CVS Emacs)

Seems very good, to me. It looks like a good candidate to replace ##setnu.el##. -- DrewAdams

I was wondering if there is way to change the color of the line numbers e.g change color/change background color so that it can be readily differentiated from the neighboring text. Great code. Thanks -- Saptarshi
Also is there a way to turn on linum mode automatically for any opened file? - Thanks Saptarshi

: Try ##M-x customize-face RET linum##. Also try ##M-x global-linum-mode##, or append ##(add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () (linum-mode 1)))## to your ##.emacs##.

: Append ##(global-linum-mode 1)## to your ##.emacs##.

Note: adding ##(global-linum-mode 1)## to your ##.emacs## will cause Emacs to ask "Options have changed - save them?" when exiting.  Clearly this is not a good way to enable ##linum-mode## globally.

[new:MichaelHoffman:2011-12-20]
Another workaround that keeps the appearance of the dynamic linum-format is to use this function which replaces the spaces on the left with zeroes that have the same foreground and background color.

<pre>

     (defface linum-leading-zero
       `((t :inherit 'linum
            :foreground ,(face-attribute 'linum :background nil t)))
       "Face for displaying leading zeroes for line numbers in display margin."
       :group 'linum)

     (defun linum-format-func (line)
       (let ((w (length
                 (number-to-string (count-lines (point-min) (point-max))))))
         (concat
          (propertize (make-string (- w (length (number-to-string line))) ?0)
                      'face 'linum-leading-zero)

== Linum: Separating line numbers from text ==

Putting the following in your .emacs will put one space separation between the linenumber display and the buffer contents:

<pre>
(setq linum-format "%d ")
</pre>

If you want a solid line separator, try something like this:

<pre>
(setq linum-format "%4d \u2502 ")
</pre>

: I like how "%d " uses only as much space as is needed for what is shown in the buffer. For example, if the largest visible line number is 50, it only uses two characters for the numbers (plus one for the space), even if there are 1000 lines in the file.  But I don't like how it left aligns the numbers. Is there a way to get this behavior with right alignment? dynamic right aligns, but it wastes space. -- [[AaronMeurer]]

:: I guess I don't see what you see.  Using the version of ##linum.el## that is in Emacs 24 (a build from Dec 2011), the default value of `line-format' is ##"%6d "##, and the digits are right-aligned.  -- DrewAdams

: No, I think you are misunderstanding the question.  %6d right aligns for me too.  But this adds a bunch of unnecessary whitespace to the left of the numbers.  %d (no number) uses only as much space as is needed, but it left aligns (this is the printf standard, I think).  dynamic right aligns, but it does so by setting N in %Nd to be length of number of lines in the file, which still wastes space if you are at the top.  Does this make sense?  I can give an example if that would help. -- [[AaronMeurer]]

:: With ##emacs -Q## (Emacs 24), I see no extra space at the left.  The the last line number, which has the most digits, is flush with the left side, and all line numbers are right aligned. Here are two images, from the top and bottom of the buffer. What am I missing? -- DrewAdams

[[image:linum-align1]]
[[image:linum-align2]]

: There is extra space in the first picture, where the largest visible line number is two digits long. With %d, you get the following (sorry, I don't know how to upload images to this wiki; feel free to upload them here if you want).  See https://gist.github.com/1602365.  Notice how in the first and second, only two spaces are used for the numbering (three if you count the padding space on the right; but you should use the mode line plus the cursor to see where column 0 is).  In the third, I've moved down two lines, and it automatically uses three spaces.  All three of these screen shots were taken without editing the file in between (as you can tell from the percentage in the mode line in the second image).  This is the behavior I like, but I want it to right align the numbers. -- [[AaronMeurer]]

:: 1. I see what you mean, but don't have an answer for you.  -- DrewAdams

[new]
Or you can set it as a function like the following if you'd like it right justified. The body of the function is modified from linum-0.9x.

(setq linum-format
(lambda (line)
(propertize (format
(let ((w (length (number-to-string
(count-lines (point-min) (point-max))))))
(concat "%" (number-to-string w) "d "))
line)
'face 'linum)))

You can use `linum-before-numbering-hook' to count and store the number of lines only once per update. Thus you can avoid the somewhat expensive `count-lines' call for each updated line. And a more simplistic constant-width version of the above could look like:

(setq linum-format "%6d ")

[new]
Here's an approach based on the previous suggestion of using `linum-before-numbering-hook' to make the line counting more efficient:

 (defvar my-linum-format-string "%4d")

 (add-hook 'linum-before-numbering-hook 'my-linum-get-format-string)

 (defun my-linum-get-format-string ()
   (let* ((width (length (number-to-string
                          (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))))
          (format (concat "%" (number-to-string width) "d")))
     (setq my-linum-format-string format)))

 (setq linum-format 'my-linum-format)

 (defun my-linum-format (line-number)
   (propertize (format my-linum-format-string line-number) 'face 'linum))

[new]
Here's a better approach. Every buffer has it's own format variable and the separator use the mode-line face.

{{{
(unless window-system
  (add-hook 'linum-before-numbering-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (setq-local linum-format-fmt
			  (let ((w (length (number-to-string
					    (count-lines (point-min) (point-max))))))
			    (concat "%" (number-to-string w) "d"))))))

(defun linum-format-func (line)
  (concat
   (propertize (format linum-format-fmt line) 'face 'linum)
   (propertize " " 'face 'mode-line)))

(unless window-system

== Linum: background color under linum in the left-margin area? ==

It is possible to change the linum's face so that the background has a custom color, but how to fix the background of the left-margin under line numbers so that it has the same color (not the default one)? See the snapshot.

[[image:leftmargin]]


[new]
As far as i know that space under the numbers is the "default" face and there is no difference between this color and the background of other buffers.  So all you can do is to have the same background color for the "default" and "linum" faces.  (You can customize a face with "M-x customize-face")  -- AlexKost


== Setnu ==

If you want to display line numbers for every line you are editing,
take a look at setnu.el by KyleJones.

* http://www.wonderworks.com/download/setnu.el

* Library Lisp:setnu+.el enhances setnu:

** If the current [[Frame]] has only one window, then it adjusts the ''frame size to accomodate the line numbers'' -- that is, it fits the frame to the buffer each time, after displaying or removing the line numbers.
** It improves setnu's ability to deal with [[Face]]s and adding/removing newlines.

I couldn't find a function to toggle setnu mode on/off, so I wrote one:

I have this bound to C-n.

: Well, first you should know, I am not an expert emacs user (yet), I really think this mode is important especially when debugging script, your eye can quickly go to the line number where the error was reported, and for this, this problem doesn't appear. This problem only appear in large files or very large files.

: To find files on my computer to test this I first issues this command
~$ find ~/ -iname '*txt' -size +500k

: I found the text version of a book I downloaded long ago (and never had the time to read) called Underground by Suelette Dreyfus. You can download the same file from this link 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~suelette/underground/underground.txt (it's legally available for free download)

: As for my Emacs configuration, I will try to describe it to my best of knowledge:
My computer have a pentium 3 1 giga hertz processor and 256 MB Ram. It runs debian sarge and linux 2.6 kernel. Emacs version is  "GNU Emacs 21.4.1 (i386-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars)
of 2005-03-17 on trouble, modified by Debian"

: I downloaded both setnu and setnu+ and put them in a folder on my loadpath. And added (require setnu+) to my InitFile. I am not sure what an extension really means, and I dont fully understand what require really do!

: Anyway, to the interesting part: I opened the underground.txt file. And type M-x setnu-mode. It took emacs almost 4 and a half minutes to show the line numbers. During this time emacs was not responsive at all. I typed M-x setnu-mode again. It took emacs 2 minutes for to remove the numbers (actually it didnt remove them right away, I have to click inside emacs once for it, I clicked inside emacs when I noticed that the processor monitor showed normal activity, during the 4.5 minutes and the other 2 minutes it took emacs to process setnu-mode the processor was at 100%)

: I also tried the same file in Nedit and gvim (to test how long their implementation of showing line numbers take, to see if maybe 4 minutes is normal) in both of them the line number appearance was insantaneous.

: I tried the same file in Xemacs, I think Xemacs use the same startup file as GNU Emacs so I am guessing it is using the same setnu+ script. It took it 15 seconds to show the numbers, but when i typed M-x setnu-mode again the remove the numbers the effect was insantaneous

: The Xemacs version was "XEmacs 21.4 (patch 17) "Jumbo Shrimp" [Lucid] (i386-debian-linux, Mule) of Tue Feb  8 2005 on penell"

: Thanks. I don't have an answer for you yet, but it would be good for you to at least determine if you have the same problem when you do ##(require 'setnu)## instead of ##(require 'setnu+)##. If so, then the problem is not in Lisp:setnu+.el. When you use `require', Emacs loads the required library. Library ##setnu+.el## does its own `require' of ##setnu.el##, so that's how ##setnu## gets loaded if you require ##setnu+##. 

: So, at least try that, please. If it turns out that the problem is ##setnu+.el## and not ##setnu.el##, then the workaround is to just use ##(require 'setnu)##. I suspect the problem is really in ##setnu.el##, but please find that out.

: If the problem is in ##setnu.el##, then please notify KyleJones (the ##setnu## maintainer). It seems odd that XEmacs would be very fast and GnuEmacs very slow. Perhaps there is a GnuEmacs bug associated with this. It would be worth finding out. -- DrewAdams

: And I also visited KyleJones personal site and I quote from his setnu description this line /"This package is best used on files with a few thousand lines at most, unless you have very fast hardware and are willing to waste it recalculating and redisplaying line numbers."/.

=== Horizontal frame resize problem with setnu+ == 
I tried using setnu+ with Aquamacs and when I add newlines to the current buffer, the frame gets wider.
(if I delete the newline, it does not decrease the width framesize)

This is fixed if you customize the variable setnu+-fit-frame-flag to nil

(custom-set-variables
'(setnu+-fit-frame-flag nil))

this will leave the frame alone, and everything is fine.

-- V.Tron

=== Problems with Soft wrap and syntax coloring ==

In soft wrap mode the wrapped line goes under the linenumbers which gives the impression that line numbers are part of the buffer.
Also, line numbers participate in syntax coloring which I think is basically wrong.

The highlight problem can be rectified by assigning the line number extent to a new customizable face.
I sent this very simple patch to the author who will incorporate it in a later release.

According to the author of sentu+, there is no easy way to get the correct wrapped line behaviour fixed. 
In fact, the proper place for line-numbers would be on the fringe, not the buffer proper.
I am truely surprised noone ever needed this basic feature of a code editor.

==LineNo: Alternative line number function ==
Last year I wrote [http://www.young-0.com/emacs/lineno.el lineno.el], which works on any size files. Rather than making line numbers for the whole buffer, it just displays them for the lines visible in the selected window, updating them as the buffer is edited or the location changed. That way the actual size of the file does not matter. I don't use it much, but it seems to work well.

On a larger buffer with line numbers, when I do C-x 2 to split the window and then scroll one of them, the numbers in the other window vanish.

Yes, that is the way it works - it draws in the current window. It would not be too hard to make it work in multiple windows, but it didn't really seem necessary to how I wanted to use it. (you would have to use buffer-window-count to find how many and what windows it is showed in, and replace the local variables with lists)

If I had time to go in and fix something, the highest priority would be to make it work with ediff. It has essentially the same problem there, the numbers are updated from inside post-command-hook, if the buffer is changed in some way that is not a command the update function is not called.

[new:SamAsk:2011-10-27] I have added lineno.el to marmalade repo (http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/lineno/0.1) (GOOD LIVE LINK).  The file is in the repo as ".tar", but just change the ending to ".el" - it is not really a TAR file.

I find that the redraw operation to put in the line numbers makes the text "jitter" uncomfortably to the right as I page up and down the buffer.  First the text is drawn by Emacs, then the line number routine redraws it shifted right to put the line numbers it.  It would be nice to hook into the first rendering, instead of hooking in after the first rendering is already done.  But it does put the line numbers in nicely.

I tried [tt]linum[/tt], [tt]nlinim[/tt] and [tt]lineno[/tt] on the sqlite-amalgamation file sqlite3.c (5MB, 148784 lines).
[tt]lineno[/tt] is the only one to be usable on my machine (3.5 GHz Intel Core 7).
