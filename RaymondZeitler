I use Emacs. I've gone from Brief to Zeus with a tiny diversion to Vedit before switching on July 10, 2000. I'm currently running v30.1 on my most modern computer that runs Windows 10 Pro 2009 64-bit.

My background is electrical engineering.  However I specialize in automating data mining and analysis, as well as computer administration, CAD and circuit simulation.  I use MS-DOS Batch file, Visual Basic, VBScript, Lisp, Fortran and Python.

I used to use PlannerMode to organize my many endless work projects. I originally used PlannerMode for a personal journal and a work plan, so I came up with a quick and dirty way of having two planner-directories. I called this "select-planner-directory" and I posted the snippet in PlannerModeContrib. "select-planner-directory" was intended to work with the version of Planner that's based on emacs-wiki.

But I decided to try OrgMode in June 2010. When I hunkered down and followed the JohnWiegley online tutorial, I became hooked.

When I upgraded to Emacs 30.1, I changed my .emacs to remove unnecessary packages.
I am a senior member of IEEE, and served for many years on the Executive Committee of my local section.

I can be reached at r.zeitler@ieee.org.  But questions or comments that pertain to Emacs should be directed to an expert.

My .emacs:
