= Running emacs like a Daemon  =

This a new feature that is included in emacs-23.1.

Start the emacs daemon with

<pre>
emacs --daemon
</pre>

== Simple setup ==

Put

<pre>
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""
export EDITOR=emacsclient
</pre>

in your .bashrc, or

<pre>
setenv ALTERNATE_EDITOR ""
setenv EDITOR emacsclient
</pre>

in your .cshrc depending on your default shell.  After that, using <code>emacsclient</code> (or <code>emacsclient -t</code>) will automatically start an emacs in daemon mode and connect to it if one is not found running, and sane programs will know to run <code>emacsclient</code> to start an editor.

== Debian/Ubuntu ==

Depending on your requirements, there are a couple ways to work with <code>emacs --daemon</code> and <code>emacsclient</code>.

=== Basic setup ===

Add <code>emacs --daemon</code> to auto-start on boot. This can be done the easy way (via "Settings > Session and Startup > Application Autostart") or by writing your own <code>.desktop</code> file and placing it in <code>~/.config/autostart</code>. 

Then make the following changes to your <code>.bashrc</code> (assuming you're using <code>bash</code>):

<pre>
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""
export EDITOR="emacsclient -t"                  # $EDITOR should open in terminal
export VISUAL="emacsclient -c -a emacs"         # $VISUAL opens in GUI with non-daemon as alternate
</pre>

For convenience (and because I'm used to them) I also added the following aliases:

<pre>
alias emax="emacsclient -t"                      # used to be "emacs -nw"
alias semac="sudo emacsclient -t"                # used to be "sudo emacs -nw"
alias emacsc="emacsclient -c -a emacs"           # new - opens the GUI with alternate non-daemon
</pre>

=== Comprehensive init script ===

Here a little init script for GNU Debian/Ubuntu
(please help to improve!)
Save in /etc/init.d/emacs
<pre>

I use also this start script placed in /usr/bin/emacs

emacsclient -c "$@"
</pre>

*bug* : unfortunately this does not work on Debian Lenny using sudo. I get:
<pre>
start-stop-daemon: Unable to chdir() to /home/root/ (No such file or directory)
</pre>

*Fixed* : replaced <code>/home/$USERNAME/</code> with <code>~$USERNAME</code> (root's home directory is /root not in /home)


Since start-stop-daemon needs root should they be sudo calls? Otherwise surely on root can run emacs in this way!
* This init script requires you to change the USERNAME variable - not ideal :/
* How do you think deal with the choose of a user? One server per user? I think its a bad idea. The server is not useful for all users.
** How about starting  a server for every user in group 'emacs' or 'emacs-daemon'?

You should rather change the variables in /etc/default/emacs, this is how other init scripts work. You could extend the script to start daemons for several users, e.g. by looking for a .start-emacs-daemon file in their home directories. But then, the init script wouldn't make much sense on a system with multiple users, anyway: such a computer should never get powered off, so the init script will not run, anyway. A better solution would be to start the daemon lazily: just create a wrapper around emacsclient, starting the daemon if it isn't already running. -- AnselmHelbig

several *bugs*
* no <code>user</code> command on my debian machine, better replace <code>USERID=`user -u $USER`</code> with <code>USERID=`id -u`</code> and remove the previous line.
* <code>start-stop-daemon</code> is in /sbin which is not in default <code>$PATH</code>, better add <code>PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin</code> below the line <code>. /lib/lsb/init-functions</code>
* still got <code>start-stop-daemon: Unable to chdir() to ~username (No such file or directory)</code>
       emacsclient "$@"
       return $?

After fixing all these, I still can't stop the daemon, <code>sudo /etc/init.d/emacs stop</code> gives
<pre>
        /usr/bin/emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
        To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start".                         
        /usr/bin/emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor.  Please use:

             --socket-name
             --server-file      (or environment variable EMACS_SERVER_FILE)
             --alternate-editor (or environment variable ALTERNATE_EDITOR)
</pre>

*Fixed:* I was able to use <code>sudo /etc/init.d/emacs stop</code> to stop the daemon with the above init script after replacing
<pre>
$EMACSCLIENT --eval "$EVALEXIT"
</pre>
in the <code>do_stop()</code> function with
<pre>
su -c "$EMACSCLIENT --eval \"$EVALEXIT\"" $USERNAME
</pre>
The problem was that root didn't have an emacs server running.  It worked fine when running
<code>/etc/init.d/emacs stop</code> as <code>$USERNAME</code>, but it would have failed during shutdown. --JasonBlevins

Several more *bugs*

* I needed to alter all uses of "~" in my .emacs (and related) files to the absolute path to my home directory.
* <code>(user-login-name)</code> returns "root". I have a working hack, but it's probably not very advisable: I've changed the <code>DAEMON</code> and <code>DAEMON_ARGS</code> variables to run <code>emacs</code> using <code>su</code> allowing me to specify the <code>-l</code> switch to <code>su</code>:

<pre>
DAEMON=/bin/su
DAEMON_ARGS="${USERNAME} -l -c emacs -- -daemon -u ${USERNAME}"
</pre>

And <code>start-stop-daemon</code> should be executed *without* the <code>-c $USERNAME</code> switch.

== Gentoo ==

Gentoo includes support for running Emacs as a daemon in the
<code>app-emacs/emacs-daemon</code> package.

: emerge app-emacs/emacs-daemon

Every user who wants to connect to an Emacs server must have an own
instance of the daemonized Emacs. The init script automatically
determines the user by its name, so you create a symbolic link
(do not copy the script, or you will miss eventual updates!) in your
<code>/etc/init.d</code> directory:

: ln -s emacs /etc/init.d/emacs.''username''

This may be added to the boot sequence (and will run under the user's
privileges)

: rc-update add emacs.''username'' default

Further customizations can be done through the
<code>/etc/conf.d/emacs</code> file, which is extensively commented.
You may also create individual <code>/etc/conf.d/emacs.</code>''username''
files for "multiplexed" user configuration.

== Emacs as Daemon on OS X using Launchd ==

If you're running Emacs 23, you can run Emacs As Daemon via OS X's launchd.  The easiest solution is to use a tool like [http://lingon.sourceforge.net/ Lingon] to create the plist file or can create one manually like this:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> 
     <plist version="1.0">
      <dict> 
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>gnu.emacs.daemon</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</string>
          <string>--daemon</string>
        </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>ServiceDescription</key>
       <string>Gnu Emacs Daemon</string>
       <key>UserName</key>
       <string>[YOUR USERNAME HERE]</string>
      </dict>
    </plist>


This can then be installed in ##/Library/LaunchAgents## and loaded via:

    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist

For further instructions see [http://cubiclemuses.com/cm/articles/2009/08/06/emacs-and-os-x-launchd/]

== Systemd user service on startup ==

It's simple enough to run the emacs daemon with [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd systemd].

{{{
$ cat ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service
[Unit]
Description=Emacs: the extensible, self-documenting text editor

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
}}}

Make sure the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> is the correct one by checking the output of the following:

{{{
$ echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh
}}}

When you see <code>%t</code> in the <code>emacs.service</code> file, it means the value of <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> (which equals to <code>/run/user/1000</code> on my computer).

Enable the unit for your user
{{{
systemctl enable --user emacs
systemctl start --user emacs
}}}

== Stopping the Emacs Daemon ==

The simplest way to stop the emacs daemon from within emacs is to use the <code>kill-emacs</code> or <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> commands.

From outside of emacs this can be achieved using emacsclient:
{{{
    emacsclient -e '(kill-emacs)'
}}}
This will shutdown the daemon immediately with out prompting or saving files.

If you would like emacs to prompt if there are unsaved buffers or existing clients/frames, you can add the following functions to your .emacs file then use the command:
{{{
    emacsclient -e '(client-save-kill-emacs)'
}}}
The display on which the the new frame should be opened can optionally be specified.

Note: If a prompt is required this function will always open an frame as an x window.

{{{
(defun client-save-kill-emacs(&optional display)
  " This is a function that can bu used to shutdown save buffers and 
shutdown the emacs daemon. It should be called using 
emacsclient -e '(client-save-kill-emacs)'.  This function will
check to see if there are any modified buffers or active clients
or frame.  If so an x window will be opened and the user will
be prompted."

  (let (new-frame modified-buffers active-clients-or-frames)

    ; Check if there are modified buffers or active clients or frames.
    (setq modified-buffers (modified-buffers-exist))
    (setq active-clients-or-frames ( or (> (length server-clients) 1)
					(> (length (frame-list)) 1)
				       ))  

    ; Create a new frame if prompts are needed.
    (when (or modified-buffers active-clients-or-frames)
      (when (not (eq window-system 'x))
	(message "Initializing x windows system.")
	(x-initialize-window-system))
      (when (not display) (setq display (getenv "DISPLAY")))
      (message "Opening frame on display: %s" display)
      (select-frame (make-frame-on-display display '((window-system . x)))))

    ; Save the current frame.  
    (setq new-frame (selected-frame))


    ; When displaying the number of clients and frames: 
    ; subtract 1 from the clients for this client.
    ; subtract 2 from the frames this frame (that we just created) and the default frame.
    (when ( or (not active-clients-or-frames)
	       (yes-or-no-p (format "There are currently %d clients and %d frames. Exit anyway?" (- (length server-clients) 1) (- (length (frame-list)) 2)))) 
      
      ; If the user quits during the save dialog then don't exit emacs.
      ; Still close the terminal though.
      (let((inhibit-quit t))
             ; Save buffers
	(with-local-quit
	  (save-some-buffers)) 
	      
	(if quit-flag
	  (setq quit-flag nil)  
          ; Kill all remaining clients
	  (progn
	    (dolist (client server-clients)
	      (server-delete-client client))
		 ; Exit emacs
	    (kill-emacs))) 
	))

    ; If we made a frame then kill it.
    (when (or modified-buffers active-clients-or-frames) (delete-frame new-frame))
    )
  )


(defun modified-buffers-exist() 
  "This function will check to see if there are any buffers
that have been modified.  It will return true if there are
and nil otherwise. Buffers that have buffer-offer-save set to
nil are ignored."
  (let (modified-found)
    (dolist (buffer (buffer-list))
      (when (and (buffer-live-p buffer)
		 (buffer-modified-p buffer)
		 (not (buffer-base-buffer buffer))
		 (or
		  (buffer-file-name buffer)
		  (progn
		    (set-buffer buffer)
		    (and buffer-offer-save (> (buffer-size) 0))))
		 )
	(setq modified-found t)
	)
      )
    modified-found
    )
  )

}}}

== Alternate shutdown method (e.g. via gnome-session-manager) ==

see the discussion at 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1167484/how-to-gracefully-shutdown-emacs-daemon/2270603

== Shutdown emacs server ==

This function will ask if you want to save any modified buffers, quit your session, and shutdown the associated emacs server instance.

Add the below code to your .emacs file.  Call it w/ <code>M-x server-shutdown</code>

<pre>
;; define function to shutdown emacs server instance
(defun server-shutdown ()
  "Save buffers, Quit, and Shutdown (kill) server"
  (interactive)
  (save-some-buffers)
  (kill-emacs)
  )
</pre>

== Color coding (multiple) emacs server instances ==

You can start different emacs server instances w/ different color schemes (so you instantly know which one you're using).

This works to set the background color:

<pre>
emacs --daemon=todo --background-color='#93DB80'
emacs --daemon=edit --background-color=yellow
</pre>

But if you try setting the cursor color -- it fails miserably.

[new:PhilHudson:2013-12-08 11:36 UTC]
I use a different color for the fringe on each instance, set using Custom.

----

Another, more flexible option:

=== starting emacs server (daemon) ===
Example scripts for starting different instances of emacs server:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

export ESRVNAME=todo
emacs --daemon=$ESRVNAME
</pre>
or
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

export ESRVNAME=edit
emacs --daemon=$ESRVNAME
ps -ef | grep -i 'emacs --daemon'
</pre>

Also see http://www.gnu.org/s/libtool/manual/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server

=== set color choices in .emacs ===
Set your color choices in your .emacs file:
<pre>
;; set colors for my emacs server instances
(defvar esrvname (getenv "ESRVNAME")) ;; is there a var that provides the server-name?
(ignore-errors ;; this prevents error when environment variable is not set
  (when (string-match "todo" esrvname)
    (setq default-frame-alist
          (append default-frame-alist
                  '((background-color . "#93DB80")
                    (cursor-color . "yellow")
                    )))
    ;; or set a color-theme, e.g., (color-theme-classic)
    )
  (when (string-match "edit" esrvname)
    (setq default-frame-alist
          (append default-frame-alist
                  '((background-color . "yellow")
                    ;; (foreground-color . "black")
                    (cursor-color . "blue")
                    )))
    )
  )
</pre>

=== starting emacsclient ===
An example script for starting emacsclient (for different instances of emacs server):
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

emacsclient -s edit -c $@
</pre>

This allows you to pass any parameters to emacsclient, e.g., filenames, or even the '-t' (or '-nw') option (it will override the '-c')

Another example:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

umask 0007 # you can set a different umask than your default for emcas session
cd ~/docs/todo/
emacsclient -s todo -c ~/docs/todo/work.org &
</pre>

=== problem and workaround for emacs daemon spinning w/ "back to top level" message ===
Problem:
During the first dozen invocations, "emacs --daemon" started up and cleanly loaded my init files.  But, after making some init file changes (including but possibly not limited to removing my prior font customizations from .emacs-custom.el, in order to go back to the default font), the subsequent invocations hung at the "Starting Emacs daemon" line.  Then, when typing "enter" at the terminal or when connecting via emacsclient, emacs continually spools out the message: "back to top level". Inspection revealed the emacs daemon was chewing up 100% of one of the cpu's.

yum info emacs
Arch        : x86_64
Epoch       : 1
Version     : 23.3
Release     : 8.fc16

Workaround:
Start emacs with "emacs --daemon -q". The first time you connect via emacsclient, open your .emacs file and run 'eval-buffer'.

== Running multiple Emacs daemons under different users ==

[[NicFerrier|I]] run many Emacs instances on a single box, as application servers. Some of them run Elnode, some run ShoesOff, etc... I normally separate these by using different operating system users to run them. Otherwise it is too easy for them to trample on each other.

=== Setting up a complete fresh daemon ===

I always:

* make a new user
* make a specific ##.emacs.d## directory for the new emacs instance
** for example ##.emacs.elpad.d##
** you need this because customs cannot be saved to ##.emacs.d## if you start with -Q
* make a boot script to start (and connect as a client) to it
** I usually copy it from another service, say TeamChat
** the boot script sets the daemon socket specifically
* start the emacs service

=== Problems connecting ===
Sometimes you get problems connecting to these multiple servers. This is normally to do with terminal permissions, especially if you just ##sudo su## from one user to another, you get this:  ##Could not open file## - here's an example:

{{{
elpad@somebox:~$ emacs-local/bin/emacsclient -s /tmp/emacs1007/elpad  elpad-elpa/
Waiting for Emacs...
*ERROR*: Could not open file: /dev/pts/9
}}}

This is down to ownership of the tty. To fix this I just ##ssh## to the user from the local box, that always fixes it:

{{{
ssh elpad@localhost
elpad@somebox:~$ emacs-local/bin/emacsclient -s /tmp/emacs1007/elpad  elpad-elpa/
## starts emacs...
}}}
