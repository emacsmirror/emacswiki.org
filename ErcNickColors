The easiest (and highly satisfactory) option is to use [[ErcHighlightNicknames]].

But if you must, below is a variety of elisp to color IRC nicks according to a list of usable colors:

==Option 1==
The colors are determined by the MD5 sum of a nick string, and if the nick-colors-list changes, so will the color indexes.  Enjoy!  Put this in your emacs load path and add <code>(require 'erc-nick-colors)</code> to your <code>.emacs</code>.  If you have any improvements or suggestions, contact me at <code>cygnus at cprogrammer dot org</code>.

<pre>
(setq nick-face-list '())

;; Define the list of colors to use when coloring IRC nicks.                                                                     
(setq-default erc-colors-list '("blue" "green" "yellow"
                                "gray" "brown" "red"
                                "purple" "white" "cyan"))

foreground colors specified in erc-colors-list.  The nick faces

  (setq i -1)
  (setq nick-face-list

           (list (custom-declare-face
                  (make-symbol (format "erc-nick-face-%d" i))

         erc-colors-list)))

(defun my-insert-modify-hook ()
  "This insert-modify hook looks for nicks in new messages and

you'll change the colors used for nicks."

(add-hook 'erc-insert-modify-hook 'my-insert-modify-hook)

(provide 'erc-nick-colors)
</pre>

==Option 2==

Here is a reformulation of the above. It is simpler to hack, and allows you to specify colors for some people (in case you're tired of their usual color, if you want to avoid collision, or whatever). Contact at antoine d0t levitt, at gmail.
<pre>
;; Pool of colors to use when coloring IRC nicks.
(setq erc-colors-list '("green" "blue" "red"
			"dark gray" "dark orange"
			"dark magenta" "maroon"
			"indian red" "black" "forest green"
			"midnight blue" "dark violet"))
;; special colors for some people
(setq erc-nick-color-alist '(("John" . "blue")
			     ("Bob" . "red")
			     ))

(defun erc-get-color-for-nick (nick)
  "Gets a color for NICK. If NICK is in erc-nick-color-alist, use that color, else hash the nick and use a random color from the pool"
  (or (cdr (assoc nick erc-nick-color-alist))
      (nth
       (mod (string-to-number
	     (substring (md5 (downcase nick)) 0 6) 16)
	    (length erc-colors-list))
       erc-colors-list)))

(defun erc-put-color-on-nick ()
  "Modifies the color of nicks according to erc-get-color-for-nick"
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (if (looking-at "<\\([^>]*\\)>")
	(let ((nick (match-string 1)))
	  (put-text-property (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) 'face
			     (cons 'foreground-color
				   (erc-get-color-for-nick nick)))))))

(add-hook 'erc-insert-modify-hook 'erc-put-color-on-nick)
</pre>

==Option 3==

Same as the above, but highlight nicks no matter where they appear, using code copied from erc-button-add-nickname-buttons.  Take Option 2 code but replace erc-put-color-on-nick:

<pre>
(defun erc-put-color-on-nick ()
  "Modifies the color of nicks according to erc-get-color-for-nick"
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (forward-word 1)
      (setq bounds (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word))
      (setq word (buffer-substring-no-properties
                  (car bounds) (cdr bounds)))
      (when (or (and (erc-server-buffer-p) (erc-get-server-user word))
                (and erc-channel-users (erc-get-channel-user word)))
        (put-text-property (car bounds) (cdr bounds) 
                           'face (cons 'foreground-color
                                       (erc-get-color-for-nick word)))))))
</pre>

You may also want to modify the syntax table for characters which are commonly in nicks, e.g.::

<pre>
(add-hook 'erc-mode-hook (lambda () 
                           (modify-syntax-entry ?\_ "w" nil)
                           (modify-syntax-entry ?\- "w" nil)))
</pre>

==Option 4==

To get a bit more variety:
<pre>
(defun erc-set-colors-list ()
  (unless (frame-parameter nil 'erc-nick-colors-list)
    (let ((v nil))
      (dolist (color (defined-colors))
        (or (string-match-p "black" color)
            (add-to-list 'v color)))
      (set-frame-parameter nil 'erc-nick-colors-list v))))

(defun erc-get-color-for-nick (nick)
  "Gets a color for NICK. If NICK is in erc-nick-color-alist, use that color, else hash the nick and use a random color from the pool"
  (let ((colors (frame-parameter nil 'erc-nick-colors-list)))
    (or (cdr (assoc nick erc-nick-color-alist))
        (nth
         (mod (string-to-number
               (substring (md5 nick) 0 6) 16)
              (length colors))
         colors))))
</pre>
add extra substrings to exclude as needed, and, if you're like me and run one emacs daemon to rule them all (including both tty and X clients):
<pre>
(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions '(lambda (frame) (erc-set-colors-list)))
</pre>
