hi there,
i'm a new to emacs and sunrise commander so just wanted to ask if there is a way of preserving a midnight commander behavior like this:
i open a file, edit it in some buffer and after closing it, i would be back in the sunrise commander layut where i was before opening the file..

?

Unless I missed something, the ELPA repository for this no longer exists.

Apparently the author is looking for a new hosting site: https://github.com/escherdragon/sunrise-commander/issues/57

New address is https://github.com/sunrise-commander/sunrise-commander


Can someone fix the images and the links on the main page?
