I tried to upload a version of ppindent.el that works with later Emacs versions.
In doing so I inadvertently changed the page type from "text entry" to "uploaded file";
it may have upset the Wiki as it still shows the old version of the file, although claiming it's the new version.
Still the new version can be accessed through https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;id=ppindent.el;revision=2

From the "Edit this page" link you can change the page type from "text" to "file" and back. So I downloaded the file, changed the page type, and pasted the file content. Looking at the diff between revisions 1 and 3 I think that this is now resolved.
