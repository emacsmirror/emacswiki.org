This page and HowToSearch and FirefoxQuickSearch should be updated.  (Because of the new DuckDuckGo search engine.)

I did what I could. Let me know if there are more instances.

Thank you!  I'll edit myself or let you know if I find some other instances.

I am not seeing a search box at the top of the page anymore. What gives?

Nic -- it's at the bottom, with an undocumented "language" input. I asked as well over at [[Comments_on_HowToSearch]]

The trouble is everything still says "use the search box at the top". SIGH.

Could we have some keyindex to focus it? Alt+s or something?

We already have. accesskey="f".

I haven't changed any of the text, because I didn't know if it was an oversight, or part of a work-in-progress.

I think I would prefer search at the top of the page.

I don't want the top of the page cluttered, but there are a number of sites (like https://github.com) that pack a lot if technical info and menus into a small space.
