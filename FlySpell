"Flyspell enables on-the-fly spell checking in Emacs by the means of a minor mode. It is called Flyspell. This facility is hardly intrusive. It requires no help. Flyspell highlights incorrect words as soon as they are completed or as soon as the TextCursor hits a new word."

Flyspell can be found at http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/Manuel.Serrano/flyspell/flyspell.html

It is also part of Emacs.
See also FlyspellWithoutColors.

See FlyspellXmlLang to switch to the appropriate language indicated in the XML document and see FlyspellBabel to switch language as indicated by LaTeX Babel commands.

== flyspell in other modes ==
Here is an example to enable it for text-mode, and disable it for log-edit-mode and change-log-mode.  These two are derived from text-mode, and thus enabling flyspell-mode for text-mode also enables it for these two.  An alternative solution would be the writing of a flyspell-mode-predicate such that symbols
are ignored by flyspell.

    (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook))
      (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1))))
    (dolist (hook '(change-log-mode-hook log-edit-mode-hook))
      (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1))))

The idiom used above makes it very easy to enable and disable flyspell for
the various major-modes out there: Just add the relevant hook to the list
where the other hooks already are.

=== Enable flyspell for comments in source code ===
Programmers can use flyspell-prog-mode to enable spell checking only within comments of source code.

[new]
Flyspell comes with a mode to check comments and strings in programming modes. Just type M-x flyspell-prog-mode or add it to your mode hooks

  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (flyspell-prog-mode)
            ; ...
          ))

== Performance ==
[new]
I highly suggest setting `flyspell-issue-message-flag' to nil, as printing messages for every word (when checking the entire buffer) causes an enormous slowdown.  -- [[nschum]]

== Avoid false positives ==
[new] 
I recently started using flyspell and am enjoying its features. Is
there a way to disable flyspell for certain regexps? For instance, I
would like to disable flyspell when typing a url. Otherwise, when
entering a url such as
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/FlySpell, www, emacswiki, cgi
and FlySpell are highlighted as errors. Any advice would be greatly
appreciated. -- MattLundin

[new]
There is only one way, using flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate which should be a function. In such a function you can use thing at point.

However it is a bit difficult to manage this as this variable may be
only one function. I have submitted a patch to Emacs devel to take
care of this.

[new]
Thanks for pointing me to the flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate
variable. -- MattLundin

I am interested in a working solution to ignore spellchecking URLs and email addresses. The answer at http://superuser.com/a/345461/40407 seems to be relevant to making a solution with flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate, though not specificly for URLs  and email addresses. MattLundin, did you come up with something?

== Change dictionaries ==
[new]
As I often need to switch between English and German I use this function:

      (defun fd-switch-dictionary()
      (interactive)
      (let* ((dic ispell-current-dictionary)
    	 (change (if (string= dic "deutsch8") "english" "deutsch8")))
        (ispell-change-dictionary change)
        (message "Dictionary switched from %s to %s" dic change)
        ))
    
      (global-set-key (kbd "<f8>")   'fd-switch-dictionary)

I too cycle through different languages, but not all that is available in the system. I use the following code inside my .emacs.

    (let ((langs '("american" "francais" "brasileiro")))
      (setq lang-ring (make-ring (length langs)))
      (dolist (elem langs) (ring-insert lang-ring elem)))

    (defun cycle-ispell-languages ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((lang (ring-ref lang-ring -1)))
        (ring-insert lang-ring lang)
        (ispell-change-dictionary lang)))

    (global-set-key [f6] 'cycle-ispell-languages)

How can I ignore or add a word without using the popup menu?

Use flyspell-auto-correct-word.

This is not working for me.  With flyspell-auto-correct-word I can go
through all suggestions for correction, but I do not get an option to
insert the word into my dictionary.

[new]
== Success in adding new words into the personal dictionary ==

I used "M x ispell-region", and the words that ispell considered having incorrect spellings were highlighted.  The point moved to the first
"mis-spelled" word.  By typing "i", I inserted the word into my personal dictionary.  Later I found that the personal dictionary was stored in the file $HOME/.aspell.en.pws in pure text format.  Although the word was added when I used "ispell" instead of "flyspell", but once added, flyspell also recognized the word as having a correct spelling. :-) This information came from the web page: http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/emacs_109.html .  Thanks!

You can also type "a" to make the word session-local and "A" to make it buffer-local (i.e. to add it to your !LocalWords list.)

== Easy Spell Check: key bindings and function to make FlySpell/ispell/aspell easy to use w/ out a mouse ==

Place the below code in your .emacs

F8 will call [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractiveSpell ispell] (or aspell, etc) for the word the cursor is on (or near).  You can also use the built-in key binding M-$.

Ctrl-Shift-F8 enables/disables FlySpell for your current buffer (highlights misspelled words as you type)

Crtl-Meta-F8 runs FlySpell on your current buffer (highlights all misspelled words in the buffer)

Ctrl-F8 calls ispell for the FlySpell highlighted word prior to the cursor's position

Meta-F8 calls ispell for the FlySpell highlighted word after the cursor's position

<pre>
;; easy spell check
(global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'ispell-word)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<f8>") 'flyspell-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-<f8>") 'flyspell-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f8>") 'flyspell-check-previous-highlighted-word)
(defun flyspell-check-next-highlighted-word ()
  "Custom function to spell check next highlighted word"
  (interactive)
  (flyspell-goto-next-error)
  (ispell-word)
  )
(global-set-key (kbd "M-<f8>") 'flyspell-check-next-highlighted-word)
</pre>

How can I position the flyspell suggestions in a window that is below the current window? Currently, on Aquamacs, running leuven color theme, when the suggestions come up, the tabs do not disappear (they did when i wasn't using the color theme). The theme is really nice (in conjunction with org-mode) so I do not wish to get rid of that. How can i force the suggestion window to appear just above the modeline?

== Run flyspell with aspell instead of ispell ==
If you use flyspell with aspell instead of ispell you have to add :

<pre>
(setq ispell-list-command "--list")
</pre>

Because the "-l" option mean "--lang" in aspell and the "-l" option mean "--list" in ispell.
flyspell-buffer, and flyspell-region are affected by this problem.

== Run flyspell-buffer after change to dictionary ==
[new]

If I add a word during a flyspell session, it's still marked up as misspelled.  And flyspell-correct-previous-word tells me that it's spelling is correct.  How do I run flyspell-buffer on the buffer every time the dictionary is modified?

== Flyspell with subword-mode ==
[new]

When the subword mode is on, especially with cc-mode, the words are distinguished more skilfully, e.g., "GoodBadType" -> "Good", "Bad", and "Type". How do I set the flyspell to work in this context?

== Flyspell with popup.el ==
If you'd like to use Flyspell's menu selection in the terminal, or just prefer to use popup.el over the graphical menu, stick this somewhere in your load path:
<pre>
    (defun flyspell-emacs-popup-textual (event poss word)
      "A textual flyspell popup menu."
      (require 'popup)
      (let* ((corrects (if flyspell-sort-corrections
                           (sort (car (cdr (cdr poss))) 'string<)
                         (car (cdr (cdr poss)))))
             (cor-menu (if (consp corrects)
                           (mapcar (lambda (correct)
                                     (list correct correct))
                                   corrects)
                         '()))
             (affix (car (cdr (cdr (cdr poss)))))
             show-affix-info
             (base-menu  (let ((save (if (and (consp affix) show-affix-info)
                                         (list
                                          (list (concat "Save affix: " (car affix))
                                                'save)
                                          '("Accept (session)" session)
                                          '("Accept (buffer)" buffer))
                                       '(("Save word" save)
                                         ("Accept (session)" session)
                                         ("Accept (buffer)" buffer)))))
                           (if (consp cor-menu)
                               (append cor-menu (cons "" save))
                             save)))
             (menu (mapcar
                    (lambda (arg) (if (consp arg) (car arg) arg))
                    base-menu)))
        (cadr (assoc (popup-menu* menu :scroll-bar t) base-menu))))
</pre>
and put this in your init file:
<pre>
    (eval-after-load "flyspell"
      '(progn
         (fset 'flyspell-emacs-popup 'flyspell-emacs-popup-textual)))
</pre>
Now calling "flyspell-correct-word-before-point" or middle-clicking a word will create a textual popup.
