The buffer called <code>*Messages*</code> is GnuEmacs's error log,
where all sorts of useful information is printed, including
information that appears in the EchoArea (except for keystroke echoes).
You can adjust the number of messages kept in the buffer with the
variable <code>message-log-max</code>.

The [[XEmacs]] equivalent of the MessagesBuffer is <code>" *Message-Log*"</code>.  The name starts with a space and does not include the quotes.  switch-to-buffer will get you there, although it's hidden by default; you may also want to bind a key to <code>(defun show-message-log () (interactive) (switch-to-buffer " *Message-Log*"))</code>.

You can also see recent messages in the lossage buffer, accessible via `C-h l'. 

= Recent Keystrokes =

Use `C-h l' to see the most recent keystrokes (last 100, in
GnuEmacs). This works for both EmacsAndXEmacs. In XEmacs, both
keystrokes and messages are logged to the same list.  In GnuEmacs,
`C-h l' (command `view-lossage') shows only keystrokes and other input
events, not messages, and buffer <code>*Messages*</code> shows only
messages, not keystrokes.

= Hiding *Messages* buffer =

For me, this buffer is useless, and annoying for its getting in the way. Unfortunately I couldn't find a universal way to suppress its creation or hide it. But since I use [[ControlTABbufferCycling#toc2|pc-bufsw.el]] for buffer switching, I just patched it to ignore not only buffers with names starting with space (the default) but the <code>*Messages*</code> as well:

<pre>
;;Return nill if buffer is not sutable for switch
(defun pc-bufsw::can-work-buffer (buffer)
  (let ((name (buffer-name buffer)))
    (and (not (char-equal ?\  (aref name 0))) (not (string= name "*Messages*"))) ))
</pre>
