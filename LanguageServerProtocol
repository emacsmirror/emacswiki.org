Per Wikipedia: "The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol for use between source code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) and servers that provide programming language-specific features. The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE."

See:
* https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/ - Microsoft's official page for LSP
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol
* https://langserver.org/ - community site

These Emacs packages support LSP
