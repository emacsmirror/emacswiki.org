[http://git-scm.com/ Git is a distributed version control system] much like [[Mercurial]], [[Bazaar]]
and DaRcs.

== Official Front Ends ==

Both Emacs and Git come with Emacs front ends for Git.  These front ends support a large subset of Git's functionality.

* Emacs comes with a generic version control front end called VersionControl or [[VC]]. It supports Git and many other version control system (vcs).  This is a good choice if you use other vcs besides Git or have no desire to use advanced unique to Git.

* Git comes with an Emacs front end for Git: ##git.el##.  For more information about this package as well as the ##git-blame.el## another library distributed with Git see the [http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/contrib/emacs/README?id=HEAD README] file accompanying these libraries.


== Third-party Front Ends ==

These third-party packages are neither part of Git nor Emacs. These front ends support a large subset of Git's functionality.

* [[Magit]] is the most popular front end for Git. If you are new to Git and do not need support for other vcs this is likely the package you should try first.

* [https://github.com/byplayer/egg Egg] (Emacs Got Git) is a fork of Magit. It currently isn't very actively maintained.

* [http://github.com/tsgates/git-emacs git-emacs] is advertised as "yet another git mode on emacs for newbies".

* DistributedVersionControl (DVC) is a generic front end similar to VC but specialized to modern dvcs like Git. 


== Extensions ==

These packages are *not* "complete" front ends but "only" to certain Git features.  Often they can be used *in addition to* the front ends mentioned above.

* [https://github.com/nonsequitur/git-gutter-plus git-gutter-plus] supports reverting, staging, and committing Git hunks straight from the buffer.

* [http://github.com/jimhourihan/egit/tree/master egit] is an Emacs Git *history* interface intended to be similar to ##qgit## or ##gitk##.  Requires ##git.el##.

* [https://github.com/mbunkus/mo-git-blame mo-git-blame] is an interactive and iterative major mode for ##git blame##.

* [http://floatsolutions.com/blog/2010/05/tortoisegit-interface-for-emacs tortoise-git.el] is a simple interface to *Tortoise Git* within Emacs 

* [[Gitsum]] is a mode to do *interactive partial commits* with Emacs in the style of ##darcs record##

* GitDwim defines context-aware commands.

* GitCommitMode helps with editing and manipulating commit messages.

* [https://github.com/sshaw/git-link git-link] creates a URL representing the current buffer's location in its [[GitHub]], Bitbucket, Gitorious etc. repository at the current line number or active region.
