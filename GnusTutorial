== Introduction ==

This tutorial introduces Gnus, an interface for reading e-mail and
Usenet news (and in fact, many other things as well) from within Emacs
or XEmacs. Gnus offers many features that other news and mail readers do
not. It is highly customizable and extensible. In other words, it can do
about anything you want it to.

However, all this can make the process of getting started an uphill
battle, especially if you are new to Gnus and Emacs. What makes things
even more difficult is that the Gnus Manual is actually more of a
technical reference than a user guide, which means that new users often
have a hard time finding out how to make Gnus behave as desired.

This is why this tutorial was written. Unlike the Gnus Manual, it may be
used as a step-by-step guide to using Gnus. This means that you are
supposed to read through it from the first to the last chapter, skipping
the non-mandatory sections if you are not interested in them.


== Getting Started on Unix ==

This chapter describes where you can download a copy of Gnus, and how to
install it the quickest. Of course, reading this chapter is only
necessary if you do not have any version of Gnus installed at all, or if
your version is no longer very recent.

At this point, we presume that either Emacs
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html or XEmacs
http://www.xemacs.org/ is installed on your site.

To check whether Gnus is already installed on your site, fire up Emacs
and say M-x load-library RET gnus RET. If Emacs says something along the
lines of, `cannot open load file', Gnus is not yet installed on your
site. If loading Gnus actually worked, type M-x gnus-version RET and
have a look at the minibuffer. It should say something like `Gnus
v5.8.8', if it doesn't, you should consider upgrading to a more recent
version.

XEmacs users might wish to use the package tool to install the current
version of Gnus. Choose the menu item Tools/Packages/List and
Install. You can find information on using the package tool via the menu
item Tools/Packages/Help.

XEmacs 21.1 and XEmacs 21.2 both come with a Gnus package for Gnus
5.8. (FIXME: correct XEmacs versions!)

Emacs 21 comes with Gnus 5.9, so you don't have to install anything if
you use that.


=== Getting the most recent Gnus version ===

The main Gnus home page is http://www.gnus.org/. Follow the
`Distribution' link, then click on the first link of that page. You can
download the file gnus.tar.gz.

Alternatively, you can use the FTP server, ftp://ftp.gnus.org/, which
also contains older Gnus versions.

Speaking of older Gnus versions, it might be necessary to make it clear
how the versions are numbered. Or named, as the case may be. Gnus
versions which are ready for distribution have numbers. The first
official Gnus version was 5.0, and now we're up to 5.9. Recently, it
appears that odd-numbered versions like 5.5, 5.7 and 5.9 are included in
Emacs and the even-numbered versions have been distributed by Lars
outside of Emacs. The versions included in Emacs generally have just one
dot, but the ones put out by Lars have two dots, as in 5.8.8 (which is
the most recent unbundled version as of this writing, mid-April
2001). The odd-numbered versions are more or less equal to the last
patch level of the preceding even version. For example, 5.4.66 is very
similar to 5.5, 5.6.45 is very similar to 5.7, and 5.8.8 is very similar
to 5.9.

Gnus 5.7 has been included in Emacs 20.5 through 20.7, and Emacs 21.1
will contain Gnus 5.9.

The XEmacs team maintains a whole range of elisp packages, Gnus being
one of them. Providing your XEmacs is relatively recent (versions 21.0
and beyond), you can easily get the latest stable version of Gnus using
the XEmacs package tools. See XEmacs Packages (The XEmacs Editor).

FIXME: contributed by Steve Youngs youngs@xemacs.org, the current XEmacs
package maintainer.

FIXME: should we add a list of contributors?

The very adventurous might try named Gnus versions. Whenever a major
Gnus version is finished, development starts on a named version. Right
now, 5.8 (and 5.9) is finished, and development has started on Oort
Gnus, which will become Gnus 5.10. Before 5.8 came out, it was called
Pterodactyl Gnus, before 5.6 came out it was called Quassia Gnus, 5.4
was called Red Gnus, and before that, we had September Gnus and (ding)
Gnus. (ding) Gnus was when Lars started rewriting the whole
thing. Before that, there was GNUS 4.x by Masanobu UMEDA. Note the
capitalization.

So, don't think that pgnus 0.99 is the most recent Gnus version, just
because it's listed last on ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/!


=== Installing Gnus ===

First, you need to decide on a directory where Gnus should be
installed. You might wish to install it in your home directory, or you
might wish to install it in a site-wide directory. For site-wide
installation, a couple of directories have become customary. For
example, the default Emacs installation is such that the executable
program is /usr/local/bin/emacs. In this case, there is a directory
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp which is intended for site-wide Emacs
Lisp add-ons. So this is the ideal place for Gnus.

Let's say you have downloaded gnus-5.8.8.tar.gz and put it in the /tmp
directory. To install this, you might do the following:

     cd /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
     gzip -d -c /tmp/gnus-5.8.8.tar.gz | tar xf -
     ./configure
     make

The first step depends on the directory you have chosen for the
installation, of course. The third step and the last step depend on your
flavor of Emacs. The above code is for Emacs users, XEmacs users will
want to look below:

     cd /usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp
     gzip -d -c /tmp/gnus-5.8.8.tar.gz | tar xf -
     ./configure --with-xemacs
     make EMACS=xemacs

FIXME: What about --with-w3?

Now the installation of Gnus is almost finished, you just need to tell
your Emacs where to find it. This is not very difficult, you just add a
line like the following to the Emacs init file, ~/.emacs:

     (add-to-list 'load-path
       "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus-5.8.8/lisp/")

Note that this line must be in ~/.emacs and not in ~/.gnus.el. This is
because, when Emacs reads ~/.gnus.el, it has already loaded parts of
Gnus. And if you then change the load-path variable to point to your new
version, this will result in a mixture of the old the new Gnus in the
same Emacs. Down this path lies madness.

Also be careful not to include any statement in ~/.emacs that might
cause Gnus to load. Anything with gnus or message or nnbla (with bla
equals mbox, ml, mh, tp, imap, ...) in it is suspicious. All these
things should come after the add-to-list statement.

In order to get the Gnus info pages added to your documentation, also
augment the INFOPATH environment variable, like

     INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus-5.8.8/texi
     export INFOPATH

The above should go in your shell startup file, such as ~/.profile. We
use Bourne shell syntax here, if you use a csh variant, you'll know how
to adjust the syntax.

Now you're ready for takeoff!


== Getting Started on MS Windows ==

This chapter is for the MS Windows users. It describes where you can
download a copy of (X)Emacs and Gnus, and how to install it the
quickest. Of course, reading this chapter is only necessary if you do
not have any version of Gnus installed at all, or if your version is no
longer very recent.

You know that Gnus is only a package of lisp functions interpreted by
Emacs (don't you?), so the first thing we've got to do is getting a copy
of either Emacs or XEmacs. Then we'll have to install Gnus. But stop,
perhaps all this isn't necessary? Perhaps you already have Emacs or
XEmacs, then we should now have a look if Gnus is working.

To check whether Gnus is already installed on your site, fire up Emacs
and say M-x load-library RET gnus RET. If Emacs says something along the
lines of, `cannot open load file', Gnus is not yet installed on your
site. If loading Gnus actually worked, type M-x gnus-version RET and
have a look at the minibuffer. It should say something like `Gnus
v5.8.8', if it doesn't, you should consider upgrading to a more recent
version.

How to get (X)Emacs: If you don't already have it, now's the time to get
it.

How to get Gnus: In case the one included with Emacs is too old.

How to install Gnus: It's not too difficult.


=== Getting a copy of either Emacs or XEmacs ===

Which Emacs: GNU Emacs or XEmacs, that's the question now.

Installing XEmacs: God save the netinstaller.

Installing GNU Emacs: A bit more hand craft but still not too difficult.


=== Getting the most recent Gnus version ===

The main Gnus home page is http://www.gnus.org/. Follow the
`Distribution' link, then click on the first link of that page. You can
download the file gnus.tar.gz.

Alternatively, you can use the FTP server, ftp://ftp.gnus.org/, which
also contains older Gnus versions.

capitalization.

So, don't think that pgnus 0.99 is the most recent Gnus version, just
because it's listed last on ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/!


=== Installing Gnus ===

After you downloaded Gnus you might have a problem with decompressing
the tarball. (That's what the Unix people call those .tar.gz files). The
solution can be found at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/utilities/i386/djtarnt.exe. Get it
and uncompress the tarball with it in a directory of your
choice. (Directories with spaces in it's name or path might cause
trouble)

Now you've got to compile Gnus. You can use the file make.bat included
in the archive. Open a DOS prompt change to the directory you
uncompressed the tarball in and call it via

     make :[X]Emacs-exe-dir: [/copy]

:[X]Emacs-exe-dir: is the directory your emacs.exe respectively xemacs.exe resides in, e.g. G:\Programme\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.4.11\i586-pc-win32\ or G:\Emacs\bin. /copy indicates that the compiled files should be copied to your emacs lisp, info, and etc site directories.

Note: If you have Emacs/w3 you should set the environment variable W3DIR
to the directory where w3 is installed before calling the make batch
file. Do it by saying something like set
W3DIR=C:\Progra~1\XEmacs\xemacs-packages\lisp\w3 at the DOS prompt.

You should most definitely choose the copy option when compiling, but
there might be situations where this isn't possible (e.g. if you don't
have write access to the lisp directories). In this case it becomes a
bit hairy. First of all you must tell Emacs now where to find Gnus. This
is not very difficult, you just add a line like the following to the
Emacs init file, (~/.emacs for GNU Emacs or ~/.xemacs/init.el for
XEmacs)

FIXME: See the Gnus FAQ for "I'm working under Windows and have no idea
what ~/.gnus means." (Should be explained here, too.)

     (add-to-list 'load-path

                  "c:/directory/where/the/gnus/lisp/files/are")

Note that this line must be in the Emacs init file and not in
~/.gnus.el. This is because, when Emacs reads ~/.gnus.el, it has already
loaded parts of Gnus. And if you then change the load-path variable to
point to your new version, this will result in a mixture of the old the
new Gnus in the same Emacs. Down this path lies madness.

Also be careful not to include any statement in the Emacs init file that
might cause Gnus to load. Anything with gnus or message or nnbla (with
bla equals mbox, ml, mh, tp, imap, ...) in it is suspicious. All these
things should come after the add-to-list statement.

In order to get the Gnus info pages added to your documentation, you've
got to set the INFOPATH environment variable. On a Win9x system you can
do this by saying

     set INFOPATH=C:\Programme\NewGnus\info;
                  C:\Programme\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.4.5\info;
                  C:\Programme\XEmacs\xemacs-packages\info;

in your autoexec.bat. In Win NT, 2K and XP it's done via Start ->
Settings -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
(Note that there must not be a line brake between the items but a space
between the semicolon and the next one.)

Now you're ready for takeoff!


== Fundamental Configuration ==

Before you can actually use Gnus, you'll have to tell it some things
about you and your environment. This section tells you what Gnus needs
to know and how to tell it.

The first thing you've got to do is creating a gnus configuration
file. To do so, start Emacs and say C-x C-f. (This means hold Control,
hit x, and then f while still holding Control. If you don't know about
this stuff, work through the Emacs tutorial!) Emacs will prompt for a
filename, your answer must be ~/.gnus.el.

Now, that we have the famous ~/.gnus.el, we'll only have to fill it.

Now you need to tell Gnus who you are. Do so with the lines

     (setq user-mail-address "you@somewhere.com")
     (setq user-full-name "Your Name")

Now Gnus needs to know where to fetch its messages from. Let's say your
primary newsserver is foo.bar.com, your second one is your local
newsserver and the third one is news.gnus.org. Furthermore, you want to
read Mails from the POP3 server pop.provider.com and use the nnml
backend for this. (See section mail for further information.)

We tell Gnus all this with

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "foo.bar.com"))
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nntp "localhost"))
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nntp "news.gnus.org"))
     
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
     
     (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "pop.provider.org"
                               :user "you"
                               :password "secret")))

If a newsserver requires authentification, Gnus will prompt you for
username and password. If you are too lazy for this create a file
~/.authinfo which should look like this:

     machine foo.bar.com login your_username password your_pass
     machine localhost login foo password bar

If your server offers access to anonymous users Gnus will connect as
anonymous as well as you specified username and password in
.authinfo. You will probably then wonder why there are so few groups and
have no idea what to do now. Don't fear, it's simple. Just say

     machine foo.bar.com login your_username password your_pass force yes

instead of

     machine foo.bar.com login your_username password your_pass

The last thing we must tell Gnus before we can actually use it is where
and how to send outgoing mails. I suggest to use the smtpmail package
for this which comes with Emacs.

     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "your.smtp-server.de")

should do the trick unless it requires authentification.

If you are using authentication, you will need to use the following two variables as defined on this reference page: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/index.html (Look in the 'Authentication' node).

  (setq smtpmail-auth-credentials '(("hostname" "port" "username" "password")))
  (setq smtpmail-starttls-credentials '(("hostname" "port" nil nil)))


== Using Gnus ==

Well, you should have set up your basic configuration now, so it's time
to fire up Gnus. There are several ways to do so, for example you could
use the menu or the toolbar or just say M-x gnus.

Gnus will now open the servers specified in gnus-select-method and
gnus-secondary-select-methods, read the group lists and check for new
mail. When this is done you'll find yourself in the group buffer, where
surprisingly the groups are listed and all action belonging to groups
take place.


=== The group buffer ===


==== Subscribing to groups ====

Gnus may subscribe you to some groups it thinks you should have a look
at, but most certainly that's not all you want. To subscribe to a group
you know the name of, say U and enter the name of the group (use the
tab-completion!). If you want the complete group list say A A or M-d if
you want the taglines too. To search in the list use C-s (this is the
command to search in the active buffer, learn it!), u subscribes you to
the group which is under the cursor. There are more options, see the
info for this.


==== The Topic-Mode ====

If you are subscribed to many groups, you may want to group them into
categories (For me it's for example misc, Emacs, Mail, Admin,
Tech). Gnus calls this categories topics and offers a minor-mode for
this. To enter topic mode hit t. There is a top topic called gnus and
one more topic called misc under it. To make a new topic under Topic X,
place the cursor behind the Topic X and say T n.

Now you've only got to place the groups in the proper topics. Say L to
see all subscribed groups, place the cursor over the group you want to
move and say T m. Easy, isn't it?

If you want that the topic mode is always active, place the following in
your ~/.gnus.el:

     (add-hook 'gnus-group-mode-hook 'gnus-topic-mode)


==== More commands in the group buffer ====

You should now know the most important things one can do in the summary
buffer, so I now only give a rough overview about commands and what they
do.

`RET'
: enters the group under the cursor

`g'
: check for new news and mail

`q'
: quit Gnus
: Beware: Never close Emacs without closing Gnus first!

`c'
: _catchup_
: marks all unread articles in the group as read

`C'
: _catchup_
: marks all articles in the group as read

<code>‘#’</code>
: mark a group
: use it to do an action on several (marked) groups

`l'
: show only groups with unread articles

`L'
: show all subscribed groups

`m'
: Create a new mail

`a'
: Create a new posting

<code>‘^’</code>
: enter server buffer

You can open and close connections to servers there (timeouts).


=== Summary and Article buffer ===

After you entered a group in the group buffer, Gnus will start getting
the headers for the group. When Gnus has finished with this, you'll find
yourself in a buffer showing a summary of each article in this group. To
have a look at an article just place the cursor over it and hit
<RET>. Scroll down the article with <SPC>, if you are through it one
more space brings you to the next unread, if you want this earlier hit
n. To scroll up hit <DEL>.

If you don't like the way the summary is presented, then your taste is
like mine. I hope I'll find the time to write a node "How to make Gnus
pretty" sometime, until then have a look in the info, especially the
variable gnus-summary-line-format may be interesting to you.

Well there's some more stuff you may find interesting to know:

`RET'
: view the article under the cursor

`n'
: next unread article

`p'
: previous article

`SPC'
: scroll down
: moves to next unread when at the bottom of the article

`del'
: scroll up

`F'
: follow-up to group and cite the article

`f'
: follow-up to group without citing the article

`R'
: reply by mail and cite the article

`r'
: reply by mail without citing the article

`m'
: new mail

`a'
: new posting

`c'
: _Catchup_

`C-u / t'
: Show only young headers
: `/ t' without `C-u' limits the summary to old headers

`T T'
: toggle threading

`C-u g'
: Display raw article
: hit g to return to normal view

`t'
: Show all headers
: it's a toggle

`W w'
: Wordwrap the current article

`W r'
: Decode ROT13
: a toggle

<code>‘^’</code>
: fetch parent of article

`L'
: create a scorefile-entry based on the current article (low score)
: <code>‘?’</code> gives you information what each char means

`I'
: like `L' but high score


=== Writing new mail and news ===

After you told Gnus that you want to write a new mail or a new posting
(a, m, F, f, R, r, you remember?) a new buffer pops up. Most of the
headers will already be filled, but some you've got to fill by
hand. Just write the stuff after the blank (e.g. Subject: foo). Write
the body of the article under the line "--text follows this line--", if
you want to add headers, just write the stuff over this line
(e.g. X-Drunk-as-a-lord: yes).

If you want Gnus to add a signature under the posting create a file
~/.signature in your home directory which includes your signature
without the "-- ". (Remember: Signatures shouldn't be bigger then 4*80
characters).

You most certainly want automatic linebreaking, include the following
lines in your .gnus to achieve this:

     (defun my-message-mode-setup ()
       (setq fill-column 72)
       (turn-on-auto-fill))
     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'my-message-mode-setup)

More stuff:

`C-c C-c'
: send message

`C-c C-d'
: save message as draft

`C-c C-k'
: kill message

`C-c C-m f'
: attach file

`M-x message-caesar-region'
: encode region using ROT13

`M-q'
: reformat paragraph


=== Help! ===

Well, most probably you will find yourself after about 17 seconds of
using Gnus in a situation where you want to do something and have no
idea how to do it. Here are some ideas what you can do now:


==== RTFM ====

To open the Gnus manual hit `C-h i d m gnus'. Then you can either work through
the menus or search in the node-titles with i or in the fulltext with s.


==== The menu-bar ====

Most of the frequently used functions can be found somewhere in the
menu. Sometimes you'll find them somewhere where you'd least expect them
so keep your eyes open.


==== The help ====

`C-h' brings you to the help. The help is not more than a line "C-h (Type
? for further options)". So lets type ?. This brings us to "A B C F I K
L M N P S T V W C-c C-d C-f C-i C-k C-n C-w; ? for more help" which
isn't really helpful to, so one more ?. That's better, isn't it?
Especially the C-h b will help you quite often.


==== Ask people ====

When you really don't know what to do, you can ask other Gnus
users. Most certainly you'll find somebody (somebody is quite often
called Kai :-) ) who can help you. Proper places for this are
gnu.emacs.gnus, news.software.readers or gnus.ding if you are running an
alpha version of Gnus.


=== Miscellaneous ===

When Gnus asks you for some kind of input, most probably the
tab-completition can prevent you from to many keystrokes. Use it!

Always remember that a Gnus-buffer is also a normal Emacs-buffer and
that all commands Emacs offers you work in Gnus too.

Gnus is not only a newsreader but also the symbol of a special kind of
user. A user who knows about usenet and the stuff he or she writes
about, so don't destroy this image of the Gnus users.


== Basic terminology and news reading ==

First, let's talk about a few terms which I'm going to use which might
be unfamiliar to you.

_say_

Quite often in this manual you will find that you are told to `say'
something. As in:

You can say (setq user-mail-address "some address") if Gnus does not
supply the right one in outgoing messages.

This means that you are supposed to take the Lisp code given, modify it
as appropriate for your situation, and insert it into the file
~/.gnus.el (or sometimes some other file, but that will be made
explicit). You can find the right file by typing C-x C-f ~/.gnus <RET>
in Emacs.

_Posting, Article, Message, Mail_

These are all related terms. A news message might also be called a
posting or an article, whereas a mail message is known as a mail. Since
Gnus treats both news and mail, the distinction isn't as clear. In the
following, I'll use the term ``message'' for the generic case and ``news
message'' and ``mail message'' for the specific cases. But sometimes, I
might use ``posting'' or ``article'', too, both synonymous with
``message''.

_Backend_

Gnus can read messages from various sources. On the one hand, there is
news, and on the other hand, there is mail. News can be read from a news
server (an NNTP server), or from a so-called spool directory. Mail can
be read in various formats.

Generally speaking, a backend describes the way Gnus accesses a set of
messages. For a news server, this is the Network News Transfer Protocol,
NNTP, and thus there is a backend ``nntp''. For mail stored in the same
format that the MH message handling system used, there is the backend
``nnmh''. And so on. See below for a list of backends.

_Server_

Whereas a backend describes the mechanism used by Gnus to access the
messages, a server is a specific instance of that mechanism. You might
create a specific server for accessing the host news.frob.org using
NNTP, say. Or you might create a server for accessing the MH-style
directory ~/OldMail.

If you are a programmer, think of a backend as the class and of a server
as an object (instance) of that class. If you are a cook, think of a
backend as an apple pie recipe (say), and think of a server as an actual
apple pie. (Yummy!) If you live in a huge city, think of a backend as a
bus (or tram, or underground) line (the Circle Line comes to mind), and
think of a server as a specific bus (or tram train, or underground
train). The one at 8:15 last Monday morning, for example. If you drive a
car, think of a backend as the model and make and of a server as a
specific car.

Obviously, there can be two servers using the same backend. (Two
instances of the same class, two apple pies baked according to the same
recipe, two busses going the same route, two cars of the same model.)

_(Select) method_

Just another term for server.

Native server

This is the primary server, so to speak. Most people let their news
server be the native server, hence:

          (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.frob.org"))

Groups from the native server are also known as native groups.

_Secondary select methods_

This is a list of other servers which one also wishes to use. Many
people are only going to have two servers, one native (for news) and one
secondary (for mail). Thus:

          (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnml "")))

Note that there is one more pair of parentheses in order to be able to
mention more than one seconary select method.

Groups from a secondary server are also known as secondary groups.

In order to be able to distinguish native groups from secondary groups,
each server is identified with a (unique) name and that name is used as
a prefix for the secondary groups. Thus, you might have a group
gnu.emacs.help (which is native) and another group nnml:mail.misc (which
is secondary). A plus character is used if the name of a server is not
the empty string. For example, given the following in your ~/.gnus.el
file

          (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods
                '((nnml "work" (nnml-directory "~/Mail.work/"))
                  (nnml "play" (nnml-directory "~/Mail.play/"))))

you might have the groups nnml+work:boss and nnml+play:so1.

_Group_

Well, if you've read news before, you know about different news
groups. One of my favorites is gnu.emacs.gnus, and I wish I would read
alt.fan.pratchett. Since Gnus treats mail in a newsreaderly fashion, it
is obvious that it uses groups rather than ``folders'' like other mail
readers do. So with Gnus there are news groups and mail groups, where
mail groups are known as mail folders to other programs.

Each group belongs to a certain server, and each server uses a certain
backend.

_Expiry_

News servers offer news groups which contain news postings. New news
postings come in, so the news postings accumulate, and pretty soon the
new hard disk is full. This is not good news at all.

Thus, a news server does what is known as expiry: it deletes old
messages. Of course, on a news server, expiry happens with no regard of
whether people have already seen the message in question; instead, the
news server admin chooses expiry times based on available disk space and
maybe on the normal amount of traffic in a news group.

But mail messages should be under the users' control, so there better be
no server which deletes messages regardless of users having seen them!
Instead, Gnus adopts a scheme where users say which messages may be
deleted, and Gnus takes care of deleting them after a while. (They are
not deleted immediately in case you made a mistake, or in case you wish
to refer back to an old article.)

_Article marks_

Gnus distinguishes between a number of article marks, which indicate
whether they have been looked at, or are considered important, or the
like. Marks are represented by a character.

If that character is a space, it looks as if the message isn't marked at
all. These messages are called unmarked, the mark character used is a
space, and marking a message with space is considered to be the same as
removing all marks—after all, such messages are unmarked. You can type
M-u to remove all marks and make an article unmarked.

Articles that are considered important or where you wish to indicate
that you have to deal with them later can be ticked. The mark character
used for ticked messages is the exclamation mark, and you can use u or !
to tick messages. Ticked messages are always shown when you enter a
group.

There is the dormant mark which is similar to the ticked mark but does
not imply importance or urgency; thus, dormant messages aren't shown by
default. The mark character used is the question mark, and you can mark
messages as dormant using the ? key.

So far, each kind of mark was associated with one character (as was the
absence of any mark). But articles which you have read are a bit
different, since lots of different characters are used here. The
important thing to realize is that these messages are treated in the
same way by Gnus; the different characters are only used as an
information for the user.

Articles which are marked as read because you have actually read them
(the normal case, one would think) are marked with the `R'
character. (Type <SPC> or g to read a message, or click on it using the
middle mouse button, <mouse-2>.) You can also mark a message as read
without actually reading it, this is indicated with the `r' character
and can be achieved with d or M r.

After exiting a group and then entering it again (some time later), the
messages that had been marked as read before appear with the `O'
character.

To reiterate: the difference between `r', `R' and `O' is only an
information for the user.

boyfriend.


== Mail ==

Quite a few people wish to read mail with Gnus but stumble across a few
issues which make this a bit difficult. This comes from the fact that
Gnus is really a newsreader, and thus it treats mail in a newsreaderly
fashion. It is not desirable to change this, because it is a wonderful
thing and this is what distinguishes Gnus from other mail readers. In
this little tutorial, I'll try to explain what ``newsreaderly fashion''
means and how exactly Gnus treats mail.

Specific pieces of behavior can always be changed, but if you desire to
make Gnus behave like a conventional mail reader, think again. It will
be an uphill battle. Maybe a different mail reader is for you? But also,
read on. Maybe you'll find the right behavior in the description below.

This chapter consists of a section which describes how to choose a mail
backend. This tells Gnus how mail should be stored on the local
disk. Unless you use an IMAP server, you also want to tell Gnus where to
get the mail that should be stored on the local disk, and how to send
your own mail. This is explained in the second section.

A third section talks about auto-expire and total-expire. These two
features are useful for mail from mailing lists. (Expiry is what Gnus
has instead of simple deleting of mail.)

A fourth section talks about how to migrate old mail into Gnus.

What is the difference between mail backends and mail sources? Well,
mail backends tell Gnus how to store messages, whereas mail sources tell
Gnus where to fetch them. So Gnus fetches mail from the mail sources and
stores them in the mail backends. Mail sources are specified via the
mail-sources variable, mail backends are normally specified via the
gnus-secondary-select-methods variable.

Only the nnimap mail backend is an exception: the IMAP server itself
receives your mail, so it doesn't need to be fetched anymore.


=== Choosing a mail backend ===

The Gnus manual lists quite a few backends. Of these, the news backends
pose no problem: you use the nntp backend if you access a news server
and the nnspool backend if you have a local news spool
directory. (Leafnode users should use nntp so that the leafnode program
can see what you are doing and choose the groups to download
accordingly.) But the mail backends are more difficult. There are many
of them, and it is not obvious which is the best choice. In quite a few
cases, this is because there is no single best choice; or maybe what's
the best choice depends on the group or changes over time.

Below, I'll give a list of mail backends. While I say something about
how messages are stored, I'll try to emphasize what that means for you
as a user.

Let's try to structure the discussion a bit. We have servers, which
contain groups, which in turn contain messages. How could we store this
on disk? After some thought, you'll quickly come up with the following
alternatives: You could store all messages from a server in one
file. The second alternative is to store all messages from one group in
one file, different groups are stored in different files. A third
alternative is to store each message in one file; in this case, one
could use a directory per group. A very interesting fourth alternative
is not to store the messages at all but instead to use the Oracle of
Delphi (say) to predict what the messages will be; this saves a lot of
disk space. I won't talk about the fourth alternative in the following.


==== Backends with one file per server ====

Many people use just two servers, the native server for news and a
secondary server for mail. Thus, this alternative would mean that you
store all your mail in one file. Since Emacs has no fancy mechanisms to
access parts of files, this means that Gnus loads that file into main
memory at startup, and all your mails are kept in main memory all the
time. (Of course, copies are written to disk every now and then, for
safekeeping!)

I think you can pretty much figure out the consequences on your own,
now:

Handling large amounts of mail will be a problem. (Emacs has a maximum
file size of 128 MB.)

Some operations on mails will be fast, since they are in-memory
operations. (Saving everything to disk will be slow, though.)

Some operations on mails will be slow, since they have to search through
the whole file.

It is convenient to have all mail stored in one file: you can easily
transfer it to another computer using FTP, say, or store it on a floppy
or Zip disk or a tape.

Conclusion: If you don't have a lot of mail to deal with and like the
convenience of storing it all in one file, one of these backends might
be for you. However, since Gnus really shines when dealing with lots of
mails, most Gnus users can be expected to deal with quite a large volume
of mail. Thus, I don't think many Gnus users choose one of these
backends.

_nnmbox_

This backend uses the well-known ``mbox'' format for storing mails. In
this format, a message begins with the five characters From_ (the last
character is a space) at the beginning of a line, and ends with an empty
line.

_nnbabyl_

This backend uses the lesser known ``babyl'' format for storing
mails. This uses delimiters for the beginning and the end of a message
which are less likely to occur in a message.

FIXME: Are they guaranteed to never occur?

One advantage of a babyl file over an mbox file is that it is possible
to insert information about a message in the babyl file, without having
to change the message itself. In an mbox file, the only place to put
such information is the message header, which is part of the
message. Thus, adding information about a message to an mbox file means
that one has to change the message.

I think Gnus doesn't make use of this advantage, though. Gnus stores
information about messages in an extra file, ~/.newsrc.eld.

FIXME: Can somebody provide me with some more arguments in favor of one
of the formats?

FIXME: Is it possible to just use an existing babyl file for Gnus, by
creating a new nnmbox server and pointing it at the file? What about
mbox?


==== Backends with one file per group ====

Storing all messages in a group in one file provides a nice middle
ground between the one file per server type of backend and the one file
per message type of backend. Using lots of little files wastes disk
space; since this approach uses a moderate number of files, less disk
space is wasted.

FIXME: Which operations are fast using this kind of backend? Which are
slow?

_nnfolder_

This backend uses the same file format as nnmbox, but uses the one file
per group approach.

There is no ``nnbabylfolder'' backend which uses babyl format.


==== Backends with one file per message ====

If the number of messages grows so large that even the size of a single
group exceeds the limit which can be handled by the file-per-group
backends, you need to think about using one of the backends mentioned
here.

This category also includes nnml, the backend which is fastest if you
have lots of messages.

_nnmh_

This backend uses the same file format (and directory structure) as MH,
i.e. a group is a directory, and each message is stored in a file, and
the file names are numbers.

Since nnml is so similar to nnmh but a lot faster, only unusual
situations could warrant using this backend. You may want to use nnmh if
you wish to use Gnus in parallel to your old MH based reader.

Normally, you should not let two programs write the same Gnus directory
(not even two instances of Gnus!), but if you really must, you may wish
to use nnmh, since there the probability of things breaking is smaller
than with the other backends.

_nnml_

This backend is like nnmh but also includes an extra file .overview in
each directory (group) which contains some headers from each
message. Thus, where nnmh needs to open every file in a group to examine
its headers, nnml (normally) needs to only read the .overview file,
which is a lot faster.


==== Other mail backends ====

There is one other mail backend, for keeping messages on an IMAP server.

_nnimap_

This backend transforms Gnus into an IMAP client. The general idea of
IMAP is to store and manipulate the mails on a server (similar to NNTP
for news).

nnimap comes with Gnus 5.8, it does not work with earlier Gnus versions.

_nnmaildir_

FIXME: Anyone out there who can give more info?


==== Summary ====

If you must talk to an IMAP server, the choice is clear. But if you keep
mails on your local disk, the choice isn't as clear-cut. I think that
nnml is generally the best choice unless you have real great disk space
trouble. Then, you should be thinking about nnfolder.

I'm not sure if there is a situation where nnmbox or nnbabyl is
desirable.

FIXME: Tell me about it if you know more!


==== Hands-on Advice ====

FIXME: Do we want to tell people to use Customize?

All of this information is nice, but how do you actually make use of it?
Well, you have to put stuff into the ~/.gnus.el file. Here are some
examples:

The following is the most simple statement. It's what I use. This just
specifies the backend to use and leaves everything else with the default
settings.

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))

It is also possible to choose a server name. With the above, you'll get
groups like nnml:foo, but with the suggestion below, they'll be named
nnml+x:foo.

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml "x"))

I suggest to go with the first one, it makes for shorter group
names. Only if you have two servers which use the same backend, then
you'll have to assign different names to them. Maybe some people want to
access two nntp servers, for example. But this is hardly relevant for
mail reading.

And then, you can choose server parameters. Server parameters are some
settings which you can include with your server. For example, if you use
the nnmbox backend, then you might wish to specify a different mbox file
to use (the default is ~/mbox):

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nnmbox ""
                    (nnmbox-mbox-file "~/MAIL")
                    (nnmbox-active-file "~/Mail.active")))

The other server parameters can be set in a similar way. The Gnus info
file explains for each backend which server parameters are possible.

Please note one important fact, however: each server wants to own the
directories and files it writes to, and gets very angry if it finds that
they are already occupied. Therefore, the nnchoke-frumple-file and the
nnchoke-gargle-directory parameters are pretty important. For example,
if you have used Pine before Gnus, then you are going to have a ~/Mail
directory which is used by Pine. Therefore, you should add the right
parameters to tell Gnus to stay away from that directory. For example:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nnml ""
                    (nnml-directory "~/GnusMail/")
                    (nnml-active-file "~/GnusMail/active")))

The file-per-message and file-per-group types of backends each have a
parameter nnchoke-directory, the file-per-server type of backend has a
nnchoke-mbox-file parameter. All these backends have a
nnchoke-active-file parameter.

Of course, nnimap is an outlier where the above does not apply.

FIXME: Can somebody say something about nnmaildir, please?


=== Fetching and sending mail ===

The previous section has explained how Gnus stores mail on your local
disk (though nnimap is a special case – it handles mail stored on the
IMAP server). But the question is, how does the mail actually get to
your local disk in the first place? For many people, the answer is
POP. POP stands for `Post Office Protocol'; here, a so-called `POP
server' keeps a mailbox for you and your computer can connect to the
remote computer using the protocol. And another important question is
what happens to the mail you send? This section tries to explain both.

Gnus knows about a variable mail-sources which can store several places
for getting new mail. See Mail Source Specifiers (Gnus), which contains
a great section about this variable. In this tutorial, suffice it to
provide a template for POP users, that will deal with the lion's share
of the cases.

     (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "frumple" :user "jrl")))

Just replace frumple with the name of your POP server and jrl with your
login name on the POP server. This line goes in the file ~/.gnus.el. As
spefified above, Gnus will then ask for your password when you fetch
mail, but it gives you the choice of remembering the password for the
session. You can also put the password into ~/.gnus.el:

     (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "frumple"
                               :user "jrl"
                               :password "secret")))

Note that this means that your password is stored on your hard disk in
the clear! If you want to prevent this, you have to type the password
every time.

You can also have several entries for several servers, you only need to
be careful with the nesting of the parentheses:

     (setq mail-sources '((pop :server "frumple" :user "jrl")
                          (pop :server "mypop" :user "joe")))

For sending mail, you probably want to contact an SMTP server
directly. This is easily done with smtpmail.el. Just include the
following in ~/.gnus.el and replace host names and so on:

     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; not for Gnus
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; for Gnus
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "YOUR SMTP HOST")
     (setq smtpmail-local-domain "YOUR DOMAIN NAME")
     (setq smtpmail-sendto-domain "YOUR DOMAIN NAME")
     (setq smtpmail-debug-info t) ; only to debug problems

The above was directly snarfed from the beginning of the file. The
comment there says it better than I ever could.

Of course, Gnus is almost infinitely customizable for sending mail,
too. Type C-h v message-send-mail-function <RET> for all the gory
details.


=== Auto-expire versus total-expire ===

Every now and then, people ask about auto-expire and total-expire. Since
both of these features are means to the same end, and since they are
similar and dissimilar at the same time, great confusion can result in
the unsuspecting new Gnus user. I'll try to explain how each works and
which one to use. However, be prepared that there will be no clear
recommendation: both work well, so for many situations both are
appropriate. So it is more a matter of taste which one to choose. And I
can't help you with that!


==== What is expiry? ====

Gnus treats mail in a newsreaderly fashion, so it is useful to examine
the situation for news. Your news server periodically contacts other
news servers and exchanges messages with the other server. The two news
servers exchange lists of messages, and messages present in one server
but not in the other are sent to the other server. This works in both
directions. Many connections between news servers exist, and this is the
way how postings travel from you into the world: when you post a
message, your news server stores it and offers it to the other servers
in the message list exchanging phase. Since the other servers aren't
going to have the posting you just wrote, it gets transferred and
finally can be seen all over the world.

You can quickly see that new messages will be arriving at your news
server, which stores them on disk. So something has got to happen else
the disk will fill up real fast. That ``something'' is expiry: the
oldest messages are deleted to make room for the new ones. Normally, a
news server can be configured on a per-group basis which messages should
be deleted. In some groups, messages might be deleted which are older
than a day, in other groups, messages might be kept for a month.

This means if you go on vacation then come back later to read news, you
are likely to miss some postings if the expiration time for the groups
you read is shorter than the time you were on vacation.

_How does that apply to mail?_

Well, mail should stay more under the control of the user than news
is. When you come back from a vacation, you expect to see all messages
arrived during that time, not only the recent ones!

Because of this, Gnus offers you the E key. This marks a message as
expirable. No mail is ever deleted from disk, unless it is
expirable. Every once in a while (by default, whenever you quit a group
by hitting q in the Summary buffer), the expiry process is run, which
goes through all expirable messages (of a group) and expires it if old
enough. By default, messages older than seven days are ``old
enough''. Seven days, that is, since it was marked as expirable.

FIXME: Last sentence correct?

``But when I read a message, exit the group, then enter it again, the
message is gone!''

Right. By default, Gnus hides messages which have already been read. If
you are the keyboard type, you can hit C-u <RET> or C-u <SPC> to enter
the group or C-u M-g when in the group to look at the read messages. If
you are the mousey type, you may wish to use the ``See old articles''
entry in the ``Group'' menu.

FIXME: How does one code menu entries in TeXinfo?


==== Why auto-expire and total-expire? ====

When reading mail, by default Gnus marks as read each message that you
read. If you want to mark it as expirable, you have to hit E. Many
people are subscribed to mailing lists and they configure Gnus to put
mails from a mailing list into their own group. Most messages in such
groups should be expirable, once read. But hitting E all the gets old
real quick. Hence, auto-expire and total-expire were invented.


==== Auto-expire vs. total-expire ====

Auto-expire and total-expire both aim at the same goal: articles which
are read should normally be expired, only if one does something special
should these articles be saved on disk. But what happens when a message
is being read by you, the user? Well, the message is marked as read
(with the `R' mark). So, what can be done to make these messages expire?
Well, two approaches come to mind: one idea is to change the mark that
is attached to messages that you read, and the other idea is to make the
`R' articles expirable. These are exactly the things that are done in
Gnus: auto-expire means to change the mark that is attached to a message
that is being read, and total-expire means to change the meaning of the
`R' mark to mean expirable.

A more precise description of auto-expire might be the following: If an
article is unmarked and then selected for reading,1 it is marked with
`E', as if the user had hit E.

It is important to realize that auto-expire has no other
consequences. Selecting a message for reading which wasn't unmarked
doesn't do anything special, and hitting d on a message also doesn't do
anything special. (It therefore marks the message as read, not as
expirable!)

Now, forget about auto-expire, empty your mind and prepare to learn
about total-expire. Like I said, total-expire changes what it means for
an article to be marked as read.

A more precise description of total-expire might be the following: When
the expire process is run (for example, when you leave a group with q),
all messages marked as read are considered to be expirable, as if they
had been marked with `E'. Recall that there are several ways to mark a
message as read: by reading it, by hitting d on it, and in a few other
ways which I haven't mentioned so far. Recall that, in addition to the
messages marked with `R', also those marked with `r' or `O' are
considered to be marked as read.

Can auto-expire and total-expire be used together? Well, in principle
they can, but that doesn't make sense. Just using total-expire alone
achieves the same effect.

So, how do auto-expire and total-expire compare? Well, for once thing,
hitting d on a message means it is expirable if total-expire is on
(since it is marked as read and all messages marked as read are
considered expirable when total-expire is on), but it is not expirable
if auto-expire is on (since it is marked as read and only articles
marked expirable (`E') are considered to be expirable). If you want to
mark a message as expirable when total-expire is off, use E.

One way of comparing auto-expire and total-expire is to compare the
message marks that are available, and what they mean. Since auto-expire
does not change the meaning of marks, its behavior is the same as in the
default case. It's only important whether total-expire is on or
off. Thus, there are only two cases: the default case and the
total-expire case.


===== Article marks with and without total-expire =====

The following are the default article marks and behavior:

_unmarked_

All new messages are unmarked. This means you haven't seen them. They
are always shown and won't be deleted.

_read_

Messages marked as read are not shown by default but kept on disk till
hell freezes over. You can show them with C-u M-g from the summary
buffer, or with C-u <SPC> or with the `Group' menu item `See old
articles' from the group buffer.

Depending on the setting of gnus-fetch-old-headers, a message marked as
read might be shown if there is a followup or reply to it.

_dormant_

Dormant messages aren't shown by default but kept on disk till hell
freezes over. You can show them with / D from the summary buffer. If
there is a reply or followup to a dormant message, the dormant message
is also shown.

_ticked_

Ticked messages are always shown and kept on disk till hell freezes
over.

_expirable_

Expirable messages will be deleted in due time. They are not shown by
default, but you can make them appear with C-u M-g and so on, similar to
the read ones.

Please note that the behavior for ticked messages is similar to the
unread ones, and that the behavior of dormant messages is similar to the
read ones. Especially the second fact will become important when we look
_at_

The behavior of the article marks with total-expire:

_unmarked_

Same as in the default case.

_expirable_

Same as in the default case.

_read_

Same as expirable.

_dormant_

Same as in the default case.

_ticked_

Same as in the default case.

As you can see, only the behavior of the read messages is different, and
you can use the dormant mark if you want to achieve behavior similar to
the behavior of read messages in the default case.


===== Speed issues =====

Total-expire may be slow when expiry happens. Why is that? Well, Gnus
keeps an explicit list of all expirable messages (the ones marked `E'
without taking total-expire into account), as well as a list of dormant
messages, and a list of ticked messages. Normally, when expiration time
comes, Gnus goes through all articles in the expire list and looks if
they are old enough to be expired.

However, for read messages the situation is different. Here, Gnus just
keeps a list of ranges of article numbers to be able to distinguish read
messages from unmarked ones. The assumption is that a message is to be
considered marked as read if it falls in one of the ranges and isn't
mentioned in any of the expirable, dormant or ticked lists.

When total-expire is turned on, Gnus needs to go through all messages in
the read range in order to look if it's in one of the lists. If the
message is not in the ticked or dormant list, it is expirable and thus
Gnus looks to see if it is old enough.

Obviously, going through all the articles in the read ranges takes more
time than going through just the list of expirable articles.

Something can be done about the speed issue, though. Normally, the
expiry process is started whenever you leave a group. I suggest that you
disable this and instead run expiry just once per day, for example while
you are going for lunch. This means that expiry still takes a long time,
but you don't see it and thus it doesn't bother you.

Here's how to do that: You disable the expire-on-group-exit thing with
the following line in your ~/.gnus.el file:

     (remove-hook 'gnus-summary-prepare-exit-hook

                  'gnus-summary-expire-articles)

And before you leave for lunch, you hit C-c C-M-x, or M-x
gnus-group-expire-all-groups <RET>.


===== Functionality =====

Adaptive scoring doesn't work with auto-expire. (But normal scoring
still works fine.) Adaptive scoring works fine with total-expire.


===== A summary =====

Well, it is difficult to sum up the whole discussion. I used to use
total-expire but have switched to auto-expire a long time ago. I liked
the fact that I could use one more kind of article mark. I also liked
the fact that marking a message as read works the same in auto-expirable
groups and in normal mail groups: you hit E. (With total-expire, you
normally hit d but must remember to use E for those groups where
total-expire is off.) And I liked that auto-expire is faster.

On the other hand, adaptive scoring is surely a very useful feature (I'm
just beginning to use it), so many people might prefer total-expire.

And on a third hand, maybe the key binding issue isn't so important
after all. You see, in mail groups the d key means `keep this message
for archival purposes', whereas in many other modes (dired, FIXME:
others?) it stands for `delete'. I propose to make it mean delete in
mail groups, too, with the following line in ~/.gnus.el:2

     (define-key gnus-summary-mode-map "d"
     'gnus-summary-mark-as-expirable)

Marking messages as expirable (rather than read) in news groups does no
harm, nor does it harm to do so in total-expirable mail groups. The old
`keep this message' semantics can still be had by marking a message as
dormant or by using M r (in non-total-expirable groups only).


=== Migrating old mail ===

Probably, you've been reading mail in pre-Gnus times, right? And surely
you wish to carry this over to Gnus. Well, I haven't found a real good
way to do it, but I can offer a few suggestions for doing it at least
semi-automatically.

One way of getting at your old mail is to type G f, and to then enter
the name of your old mail file. This provides read-only access to your
mails. For some people, this might be sufficient. (With G f, you have
created an nndoc group.)

Some people might want to have their mails available in their normal
mail groups hierarchy. That's simple, just create an nndoc group for
your mail file, then mark all messages in it with M P a, then copy all
of them over to a normal mail group, with B c.

This is good for people who wish to keep their old arrangement of
folders, and who have a one-to-one correspondence between old mail files
and new Gnus groups. But some people might wish to split up their mails
differently. For them, it might be useful to set up nnmail-split-methods
correctly and to use B r instead of B c. This goes through all
process-marked messages and subjects them to the same splitting process
that newly arriving messages go through. (Whee! What a run-on sentence!)


=== Making Gnus behave like other mail readers ===

FIXME: This section is very incomplete! I hope that somebody will
provide us with settings that might be desirable.


==== Don't hide messages that have been read ====

Gnus operates in a newsreaderly fashion and thinks that most of the time
you don't want to read messages twice. So it hides from you the messages
that you have read already. It does not, however, delete these messages!
They are still on disk.

If you want to see old messages, use C-u <RET> to enter a group, or type
C-u M-g from within the group. If you always want to see old messages
for a specific group, hit G c (not g c) on it and frob the display
parameter. If you want to see old messages for several groups, you can
also set the parameter on a topic. If you want to do it by group name,
see the variable gnus-parameters (in recent Gnusae only).

But I advise against this, because showing a lot of messages in the
summary buffer is quite slow in Gnus, and you can tell Gnus to show you
the interesting ones. For example, I use

     (setq gnus-fetch-old-headers t)

and this means that when a new followup arrives in a thread, I see the
previous messages from that thread, too. Of course, from time to time, I
want to look at old messages and use C-u <RET> or C-u M-g, as described
above. (Be aware that putting fetch-old-headers to t will take an long time to download

=== Archiving Mail ===

(TODO)

the many other methods provided by Gnus.

statement.


== Reading articles ==

Gnus has hundreds of commands and keybindings that allow you to do all
kinds of fancy things: the Gnus manual explains how to do them in
depth. I recommend that you explore this stuff in depth.

However, at first (and at second and at third, too) this insane list can
be daunting, especially for those relatively new to Emacs as well as
Gnus, so in this section we'll go over the basic stuff that is good (and
hopefully sufficient) to know to get started, in roughly the order that
you'll need them. Then you can explore the intricacies as you get more
comfortable.

Note that this stuff pertains to both news and mail reading, which is
one of the best things about Gnus: it provides you with a powerful and
unified set of commands.


=== Moving Around ===

(I will discuss just the group and summary buffers, as that should be
all you're concerned with, most of the time.)

There are many navigation commands: to see a complete and intimidating
list, see the Gnus manual. Here are the most basic commands that you
should really learn on day 1, and some hints for memorizing them.

As in many packages and modes in Emacs, the letters n and p are
associated with next and previous operations in Gnus, respectively. In
both the group and summary buffers, lots of commands are generated by
using different modifiers with n and p. The commands are generally
analogous for the two buffers.

_Key_
: Group buffer
: Summary buffer

`n'
: next group with unread articles
: next unread article

`p'
: previous group with unread articles
: previous unread article

`N'
: next group
: next article

`P'
: previous group
: previous article

`C-n'
: next line
: next line

`C-p'
: previous line
: previous line

The idea here is that since most of the time you won't care to select
groups with no unread articles or articles which you have already read,
you can navigate to and fro just with n and p. But of course, there will
still be times when you will want to enter such a group (to find some
useful article that you had read) or select such an article (to read
that useful article from before), so the capitalized commands are also
conveniently available.

Note that if you get to the bottom of the summary buffer for a group,
and you type n or N, you will be taken to the first appropriate article
in your next group (so that sometimes you will find yourself just
reading away with one finger of the left hand on the n key, and with
your right hand around a warm cup of tea.

Also note that, as is typical in Emacs modes, C-n and C-p are not
overridden: they still take you to the next and previous lines, so you
can always fall back on this knowledge, since both group buffers and
summary buffers are line-based (i.e., one group or article per line).

Last but certainly not least, there are the commands (specific to the
summary buffers) for scrolling an individual article when reading
it. Switching windows (C-x o) and scrolling (C-v, M-v) is not the way to
go (I mean, it will work, but BLAH). Much better is to scroll the
article buffer up and down from the summary buffer with SPC and DEL. In
fact, you should almost never have to actually enter the article
buffer. (But if you do, you will find that the key bindings for article
and summary buffers is virtually the same.)
