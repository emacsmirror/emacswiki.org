This page is about '''[::Emacs Speaks Statistics]''', also sometimes called EmacsStatisticalSystem, but usually called '''[::ESS]'''. As always, you can click the page heading to list all pages related to ESS.

ESS is a package that integrates various statistical software with Emacs. S, R (a free implementation of S), Stata, Julia, and SAS modes are all supported by ESS, making it possible to hook writing and programming in Emacs right into your stats. It's pretty slick.

Consider using the prefix "ESS" for new ESS-related pages. -- PaulJohnson

== Basic configuration options ==

 (setq ess-eval-visibly nil) ; ESS will not print the evaluated commands, also speeds up the evaluation 
 (setq ess-ask-for-ess-directory nil) ;if you don't want to be prompted each time you start an interactive R session
