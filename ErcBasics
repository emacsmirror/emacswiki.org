ERC is an InternetRelayChat (IRC) client.

For more Info on IRC, see the IRC help archive:

* http://www.irchelp.org/

== Getting Started ==

Assuming you downloaded the tarball and extracted the elisp files into
~/elisp/erc, load ERC by using M-x load-file and typing ~/elisp/erc/erc.el at the prompt.
Then call M-x erc and answer the questions as follows:

* IRC server: irc.freenode.net
* IRC port: 6667
* Nickname: (type a nickname)
* Password: (none)

Note that ERC will append some punctuation characters to make your
nickname unique if it isn't.  Thus, usually you need not worry about
inventing unique nicknames.  On Freenode(irc.freenode.net) people
can reserve their nicknames; in that case you will see a warning, and
may be kicked off the network by the owner of the nickname, but let's ignore
that for the moment.


== How It Works ==

The first thing you have to do is join a channel.  Type the following
command:

 /JOIN #emacs

One of the lines should tell you the nicknames of the other users on the channel.
Whatever you type now will be seen by everyone else on the channel.
Type:

 Hi all.  I'm testing ERC!

Commands start with a slash.  Here are the most important ones:

* /JOIN #foo -- join channel #foo
* /PART -- leave the current channel
* /QUIT msg -- disconnect and leave message msg for all to see

You can join several channels at a time.  ERC will create a new buffer for each
channel you join.

NOTE: If you can't join #emacs channel or any other which requires you to be identified visit https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration to see the instructions to identify yourself.
