I wanted to use the ##'dynamic## symbol with my ##linum-format## but I also wanted a vertical bar separator between the linum and my code.  I took a look at what ##dynamic## does and just added the following to my ##.emacs## file and it works great.

{{{
(setq linum-format
  (propertize
   (format " %%%dd \u2502"
	   (length (number-to-string
		    (count-lines (point-min)
				 (point-max)))))))
}}}

your patch to display last line num doesn't work.
