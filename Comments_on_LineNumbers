I wanted to use the 'dynamic symbol with my linum-format but I also wanted a vertical bar separator between the linum and my code.  I took a look at what dynamic does and just added the following to my .emacs file and it works great.
(setq linum-format (propertize (format " %%%dd \u2502" (length (number-to-string (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))))))
