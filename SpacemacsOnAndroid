This page is about how to install, and update, the Spacemacs starter kit in Android Emacs. For an overview of the different alternatives for running emacs on Android, see EmacsOnAndroid.

Android Emacs can be used with various StarterKits, for example Spacemacs and Doom Emacs.

As compared to Doom Emacs on Android, Spacemacs on Android has the advantage, that installation and updates of packages is done completely inside the running emacs, without the need for starting a new emacs process in the running emacs. This is both faster, and does not rely on the capability to start a new emacs process. Android currently does not have official support for letting an application start a new process of itself. So even if emacs may currently be able to start a new version of itself, on your device, this capability may disappear when you upgrade Android to a new version.
