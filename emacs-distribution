# Simplifies running Emacs from an alternative $HOME in order to
# experiment with alternative configurations without affecting your
# default (~/.emacs.d) config.
#
# Run "emacs-distribution --help" for usage details.
#
# n.b. This script is essentially just a wrapper for the command:
# env HOME=$HOME/emacs/distributions/NAME emacs

# Version 1.01
# Author: Phil S.
# URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-distribution

# Dependencies:
# Currently assumes the presence of the non-POSIX GNU getopt utility
# which provides support for --long command line arguments.


# Commentary:

# For lack of a better term, I am referring to these independent
# configurations as Emacs "distributions".
#
# Distributions will live under ~/emacs/distributions/
# Each distribution will serve as an alternative $HOME directory, and
# therefore the actual Emacs configuration will typically live in a
# .emacs.d sub-directory of that distribution.
#
# Distributions shouldn't interact with each other, so you can run
# them together and have multiple side-by-side emacs instances, each
# using a different configuration.

# TO DO:
# Rename to emacs-sandbox and ~/.emacs.d.sandboxes/
# Allow cloning of a single init file (all supported formats).
# Post-processing of repositories to support other directory structures.
# Support archive formats?
# (or a generic "fetch a thing" command to cover files/archives/URLs/repos/etc?)


# Running a distribution:
# -----------------------
# To run an Emacs distribution (whether an existing distribution
# OR a new blank-slate distribution), simply use:
# $ emacs-distribution NAME
#
# If NAME is a new distribution, the necessary directories and init
# file will be created first before running Emacs. As a convenience,
# the new init.el file will also be visited the first time a new
# distribution is started, so that you can immediately make any desired
# changes. On subsequent starts, this file is not automatically visited.
#
# Once running, you may wish to install new packages using the package
# manager (M-x package-install), or follow the installation directions
# for any other libraries you are interested in -- remembering to
# substitute the path "~/emacs/distributions/NAME/" for "~/" if placing
# files under your home directory from outside of the running Emacs
# instance (inside that instance "~/" will be the distribution's home).


# Pre-packaged distributions, and --clone:
# ----------------------------------------
# Some configurations such as Emacs Prelude or Emacs Live come ready-
# made with an init.el file, and need only be installed to the
# appropriate .emacs.d directory. If the repository (or otherwise)
# represents the .emacs.d directory, then you can clone it directly:
#
# $ emacs-distribution prelude --clone="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git"
# $ emacs-distribution emacs-live --clone="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live.git"
#
# In other scenarios, you can manually copy the appropriate directory as
# ~/emacs/distributions/NAME/.emacs.d and then run the distribution with:
# $ emacs-distribution NAME
#
# Distributions can also be cloned from the filesystem.
# The uses of --clone are as follows:
#
# $ emacs-distribution --clone NAME
#   Creates a copy of ~/.emacs.d as NAME.
#
# $ emacs-distribution --clone=DIST NAME
#   Creates a copy of existing distribution DIST as NAME.
#
# $ emacs-distribution --clone=PATH/TO/DIR NAME
#   Creates a copy of existing directory DIR as NAME.
#   DIR will be copied as the .emacs.d directory, unless it
#   contains a .emacs.d directory.
#
# $ emacs-distribution --clone=REPO NAME
#   Clones version-control repository REPO as NAME.
#   (Only git repositories are supported at this time.)
#   REPO is assumed to represent the .emacs.d directory.
#   If it does not, you will need to manually modify the
#   distribution directory.


# Default command-line options and per-distribution Emacs versions:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# To use a specific version of Emacs for a distribution, either
# specify the emacs command to run using the --emacs="COMMAND" option,
# or place a file named "emacs-command" in the distribution directory
# containing the command to run. If this file exists, it will be used
# automatically (unless overridden by --emacs="COMMAND").
#
# e.g.:
# $ emacs-distribution --emacs=emacs-22.3 my-emacs-22-config
# $ echo "emacs-22.3" >~/emacs/distributions/my-emacs-22-config/emacs-command
# $ emacs-distribution my-emacs-22-config
#
# Note that you may specify emacs command-line options as part of the
# emacs command with either of these techniques. Therefore if you wish
# to use certain options by default for a given distribution, the
# simplest way is to specify them in an "emacs-command" file.
#
# To pass options to emacs from the command line without specifying an
# emacs command, simply use the -- argument first.  All subsequent
# arguments will be passed to Emacs. e.g.:
# $ emacs-distribution foo -- --debug-init --title="Foo distribution"


# Upgrading Emacs:
# ----------------
# This script facilitates a fairly useful approach for upgrading to
# a new version of Emacs (provided you are able to install the new
# version alongside the old).
#
# Simply set up a copy of your existing config as a new distribution
# to use with the new Emacs, until you're convinced everything is
# working. This will enable you to debug and edit the new config
# without the risk of breaking your existing one.
#
# Or you could flip this approach around, and instead make the
# original config into a distribution, in case you need it as a
# back-up.


# Notes on relocating $HOME:
# --------------------------
# As already indicated, this script works simply by setting an
# alternative $HOME directory for Emacs to see, which ensures that
# the 'distribution' is separate from your default configuration.
#
# See C-h i g (emacs) Find Init RET
#
# The down-side to this technique is that Emacs won't see all your
# other dot files (because it will be looking in $HOME), and so
# running other processes from within Emacs won't necessarily work as
# normal; but that's not likely to be a huge issue if you're just
# experimenting, and you can always symlink or copy the bits you need.
#
# The benefit is that if anything in the distribution writes files to
# the home directory, they can't clobber your real files, or add any
# unwanted cruft.
