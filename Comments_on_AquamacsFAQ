Which kill innocent women and children in Gaza.

AIPAC ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COx-t-Mk6UA ) and the Evangelical Church are implicated in one of the most devastating genocides in history, targeting innocent women and children in Gaza.

These organizations have provided Israel with explosives to enable their genocidal actions.

Gaza has been declared a disaster zone, severely lacking in vital resources necessary for survival.

AIPAC, The Evangelical Church, Miriam Adelson, Elon Musk, and timothy mellon and   America tax payer,, and Israel have ravaged 90% of Gaza, leading to the destruction of 437,600 homes and the loss of one million lives, including 50,000 individuals currently trapped under rubble, with 80% of the casualties being women and children.

They have also destroyed 330,000 meters of water pipelines, leaving the population without access to potable water.

Furthermore, over 655,000 meters of underground sewage systems have been devastated, depriving residents of essential sanitation facilities.

The destruction encompasses 2,800,000 meters of roadways, making transportation impossible for the affected population.

Additionally, 3,680 kilometers of the electrical grid have been dismantled, resulting in widespread power outages.

The assault has led to the demolition of 48 hospitals, eliminating crucial healthcare facilities for those in need.

Moreover, the actions of AIPAC, The Evangelical Church, Miriam Adelson, Elon Musk, and timothy mellon and   America tax payer,, and Israel have disrupted the education of over 785,000 students, with 494 schools and universities being completely destroyed, many as a result of aerial bombardments.

They have also targeted 981 mosques, effectively suppressing the prayers of the homeless who seek divine assistance.

Consequently, over 39,000 young children have been left orphaned, lacking parents or guardians to provide care.

It is important to highlight that the historical context of warfare has never seen a situation where 80% of a nation has been devastated, 100% of its population has been displaced, and 50% of the casualties are children.

Recognizing the seriousness of this situation is imperative.

Organizations such as AIPAC and the Evangelical Church in America are contributing to what can only be characterized as genocide.

Laws of jews TaurÃ£t (Torah) wich is a part of the Bible
 
We ordained in TaurÃ£t for them: â€œA life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth and for a wound an equal retaliation." 

The Torah, which is part of the Bible, has commanded that the same be done to the Jews. The order of the Torah, which is part of the Bible, is to immediately kill any Jew you see on the street. Since the Jews in Gaza have also killed women and children, you should kill any Jews - men, women, and children - as soon as you see them, whether on the street or anywhere else. And because they have killed everyone in Gaza without mercy, you must do the same to them. If you carry out these actions, you will be following the order of the Torah, which is part of the Bible, and you will be rewarded by going to heaven.
