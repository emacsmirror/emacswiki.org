This page is about library '''<tt>[[narrow-indirect.el]]</tt>''', which lets you 
create an [[IndirectBuffers|indirect buffer]] that is a clone of the current buffer and that is narrowed to a particular portion of it.

Such an indirect buffer gives you a different view of a portion of
the buffer, or even of the whole buffer (use '''`C-x h C-x 4 n n'''').
It always has the same text and text properties, but otherwise it
is pretty independent.

In particular, you can kill an indirect buffer without affecting
its base buffer.  You will likely want to kill indirect narrowed
buffers rather than widening them.

''Note:'' Because the indirect clone shares text properties with it
base buffer, if you give it a different major mode that uses
different font-locking then the font-locking of the base buffer
changes the same way.  However, you can restore the font-locking
appropriate to the base buffer, by just toggling `font-lock-mode'
off and on again there.

See the Emacs manual, node [[Manual:Indirect Buffers|Indirect Buffers]] (Concept).

It is helpful to be able to easily distinguish indirect buffers
from non-indirect buffers.  Library <tt>[[narrow-indirect.el]]</tt> offers two ways to do
this, for the indirect buffers it creates:

* The buffer name of an indirect narrowed buffer starts with a
  prefix that you can set using option `ni-buf-name-prefix'.  The
  default value is '''`I-''''.

* The name of an indirect narrowed buffer is highlighted in the
  [[mode line]] using face '''`ni-mode-line-buffer-id'''' instead of face
  `mode-line-buffer-id'.  To turn this off, just customize the
  former to be the same as the latter.

By default, the name of an indirect narrowed buffer reflects the
name of its base buffer and the text of the narrowed region (or
the name of the defined object, in the case of
`ni-narrow-to-defun-other-window').  But you can control this in
several ways.  See the command doc strings.

To customize the behavior of this library, do this:

  M-x customize-group Narrow-Indirect

Suggested key bindings:

 (define-key ctl-x-4-map "nd" 'ni-narrow-to-defun-other-window)
 (define-key ctl-x-4-map "nn" 'ni-narrow-to-region-other-window)
 (define-key ctl-x-4-map "np" 'ni-narrow-to-page-other-window)


Acknowledgments:

The idea and original code for a command that combines narrowing
with cloning a buffer as an indirect-buffer is due to ZaneAshby, [[http://demonastery.org/2013/04/emacs-narrow-to-region-indirect/ here]].

In Emacs [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=17401|bug thread #17401]], PhilSainty proposed adding three
commands to GnuEmacs based on this approach.  LennartBorgman
contributed code that uses,  in
the cloned buffer name, some text based on the narrowed region.

The code in <tt>[[narrow-indirect.el]]</tt> extends this a bit and provides
a couple of user options and some alternative ([[prefix argument|prefix-argument]])
behavior.  It is doubtful that Emacs Dev will ever adopt features
such as those defined here, and if they do then this library can
at least help for Emacs versions prior to their addition.
