I am member of the ChurchOfEmacs, development section. Author of a few Emacs Lisp libraries:

* a programmer's interface to PostGreSQL
* InternetPrintingProtocol (IPP)
* BabelMode, which uses translation engines such as babelfish to translate text. 
* DictWeb mode, which looks up dictionary definitions from dict.org
* CoffeeMode, an Emacs implementation of the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (RFC2324)
* EmacsHttpd, a web server embedded in the Emacs


I would love one day to use a CommonLispEmacs.
