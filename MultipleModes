= polymode =

See Polymode

= mmm-mode.el =

See MmmMode

= multi-web-mode.el =

Multi Web Mode ([https://melpa.org/#/multi-web-mode MELPA], [https://github.com/fgallina/multi-web-mode GitHub]) auto-selects major modes for HTML files as the point is moved around. It is written by FabianGallina

= mumamo.el =

See MuMaMo 
= multi-mode.el =

Multi Mode ([https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/multi-mode.html ELPA]) is mentioned in the Emacs TODO as a reference approach for supporting different major modes in one buffer.

* http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/multi-mode.el

See also its uses in noweb.el and haskell-latex.el in the same directory.

= two-mode-mode.el =

Two Mode Mode by DavidWelton.
This one is used for one of the solutions on the PhpMode page.
It seems to be very easy to use -- just specify the start and end regular expressions for the second mode.

See EmacsLispAndLaTeX for an example.

= Indirect buffers =

This is a built-in feature in Emacs. Indirect buffers feature does not exactly give multiple major modes in the same logical buffer but it gives user two (or more) different buffers which have their textual content linked together. To clone a buffer use `C-x 4 c' and then use different major modes in the clones. See the Emacs reference manual for more information about indirect buffers.  See also IndirectBuffers.

Library <tt>[[narrow-indirect.el]]</tt> facilitates creating indirect buffers cloned and narrowed from other buffers.  And yes, you can use different [[major mode]]s in them, even fontifying them differently etc.  See NarrowIndirect.
