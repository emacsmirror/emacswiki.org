Here's some examples of stuff you can do to configure [[rcirc]].

== Various ==

{{{
;; You can autoload, but at the end of this block we'll
;; connect to two networks anyway.
(require 'rcirc)

;; Don't print /away messages.
;; This does not require rcirc to be loaded already,
;; since rcirc doesn't define a 301 handler (yet).
(defun rcirc-handler-301 (process cmd sender args)
  "/away message handler.")

;; Turn on spell checking.
(add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook (lambda ()
			     (flyspell-mode 1)))

;; Keep input line at bottom.                                                                               
(add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (set (make-local-variable 'scroll-conservatively)
		 8192)))

;; Turn on logging everything to a special buffer, for debugging.
(setq rcirc-debug-flag t)

;; Adjust the colours of one of the faces.
(set-face-foreground 'rcirc-my-nick "red" nil)

;; Set typeface for rcirc buffers; this example uses variable-width Verdana size 10
(dolist (rcirc-face (remove-if-not 
		     (lambda (elt) (equal (cadr elt) 'custom-face))
		     (get 'rcirc-faces 'custom-group)))
  (set-face-font (car rcirc-face) "verdana-10"))

;; Include date in time stamp.
(setq rcirc-time-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M ")

;; Change user info
(setq rcirc-default-nick "chachi")
(setq rcirc-default-user-name "carcola")
(setq rcirc-default-full-name "scott baio")

;; Join these channels at startup.
(setq rcirc-startup-channels-alist
      '(("\\.freenode\\.net$" "#emacs" "#rcirc")))

;; Connect to servers.
(rcirc); freenode is the default
(rcirc-connect "localhost"); if you run bitlbee, this will connect to it
}}}

See BitlBee for an explanation of that last line.

== Changes in Emacs 23 ==

rcirc-startup-channels-alist changed to rcirc-server-alist in Emacs 23, see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/rcirc/Configuration.html.  The example there did not work for me, the first time you set it the list does not yet exist use something like the following:

<pre>
(setq rcirc-server-alist
      '(("irc.freenode.net" :channels ("#emacs" "#python" "#sml" "#nasm" "#gcc"))))
</pre>

Apparently this line is not working anymore:
<pre>
(rcirc); freenode is the default
</pre>
This works in my tests:
<pre>
(rcirc-connect "irc.freenode.net")
</pre>

== New Commands ==

Process and target are dynamically bound, so you only need to know about `defun-rcirc-command' and `rcirc-send-message'.

{{{
(defun-rcirc-command bold (text)
  "Post a bold message to the current target."
  (interactive)
  (rcirc-send-message process target (concat "\002" text "\002")))
}}}
