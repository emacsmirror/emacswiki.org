In GNU Plot, info files menu items do not match the regular expression:
{{{
"\n\\* \\(.*\\): " 
}}}
as it is used in ##info-look.el.gz##. To make info work with gnuplot-mode I've changed this regexp within the definition of ##info-lookup-make-completions## to:
{{{
"\n\\* \\(.*\\):[ :]"
}}}

Is there a way to make ##C-h S## pop directly to the info manual, rather than being prompted for the command to be searched for?  Thanks.
