[[VincentFoley]] asks: could anyone describe the differences between rcirc and ERC from an end-user point of view?

: AlexSchroeder replies: For beginners, there should be no significant differences. After all, both claim to be easy-to-use IRC clients. The differences begin when customizing or hacking it. Neither of the two has introduced radical changes to the user interface.

: WeakishJiang replies: I have not used ERC. But I found this piece on [[InternetRelayChat|this page]]:

:: I used ERC for a while, but I was not very fond of the 20 odd files required in 
:: my elisp directory, so I switched to rcirc and haven’t looked back since. It does
:: everything I need, the (very clean) code is contained in a single file, I’m very happy! 
:: – VincentFoley
: Hope it helps.
