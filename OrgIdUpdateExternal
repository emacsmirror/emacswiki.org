=== Update Orgmode IDs externally and asynchronously, using find and grep! ===



Do you have /a lot/ of OrgMode files, with many ##id:## links throughout?

Annoyed by how long the function ##org-id-update-id-locations## takes to run (especially given that Emacs is single threaded, and this is a blocking action)?

Even more annoyed that ##org-id-update-id-locations## needs to open /each and every one/ of your Orgmode files just to check them for IDs?  And then has the nerve /not to clean up after itself/, instead leaving them laying around all over the place, /like some sort of animal/?!

If so, this package may be for you.
