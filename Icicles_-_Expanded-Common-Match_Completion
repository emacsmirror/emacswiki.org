== Expanded-Common-Match Completion ==

Apropos (regexp) matching and [[prefix completion]] each match a
pattern against a [[completion]] candidate.  This operation concerns
only a single candidate; it does not take into account the fact
that there are others.  Since the matching operation is repeated
anyway for each candidate, however, we can also find an expanded
string that ''includes the same match'' (apropos or prefix) for ''all''
candidates.  For prefix completion, Emacs completes your input to the
longest common prefix match.  '''Icicles''' uses a similar notion for [[apropos completion]].

For example, if you enter `M-x minib' and hit `TAB', Emacs
completes your input to `minibuffer', which is the longest prefix
match for `minib' among all command names.  The actual string that
matches prefix `minib' among all candidates is, itself, `minib'.

If you hit `S-TAB', then each matching candidate contains a
substring that matches your [[regexp]] input `minib'.  In this case,
that substring is `minib', just as in the prefix-matching case.
And, as in the prefix case, each matching candidate also includes
a longer substring, `minibuffer', which includes what your input
matches for each candidate.

'''Icicles''' replaces your regexp input in the [[minibuffer]] by a common substring.  '''Icicles''' highlights this expanded common match
in buffer `*Completions*' using face
`icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions' (magenta foreground, by default).
What your input matches directly is highlighted in `*Completions*'
using face `icicle-match-highlight-Completions' (red foreground, by default).

It is of course possible that a given regexp matches different
candidates differently, so that there is no common match.  In that
case, only the individual matches are highlighted in `*Completions*'
-- you will see only red, no magenta, highlighting.  For example,
if your regexp input is `##min.*buf##' then various different
substrings (such as `minibuf' from `minibuffer-complete' and
`mint-truncate-buf' from `comint-truncate-buffer') are highlighted
in red, but these share no common substring.

You will also see only red highlighting if what your input matches
directly is the same as the expanded common match.  For example, if
a function `moccur-regexp-read-from-minibuf' is defined (it is in
library <tt>[[color-moccur.el]]</tt>), and your input to `C-h f' is
`##min[^-]*buf##', then only `minibuf' is highlighted in red.

[:C-l]
Expanded-common-match completion is convenient, but when
apropos-completing you often need to try variants of a regexp,
editing it and observing which candidates match in `*Completions*',
until you get the regexp right.  Expanded-common-match completion
has the disadvantage that you lose your regexp as input, which
makes it hard to edit it!  

To retrieve it, use '''`C-l''''
(`icicle-retrieve-previous-input') during completion.  You can repeat `C-l' to retrieve older completion inputs, cycling among them, and you can use
`C-S-l' (that is, '''`##C-L##'''') to cycle previous inputs in the other
direction -- see [[Icicles - History Enhancements]].  You can use [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match|icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt>'''' to turn off expanded-common-match completion altogether, if you prefer.   You can cycle the value of this option from the minibuffer at any time, using '''`##C-M-"##''''.



[:icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag]
Sometimes the current completion candidates can be quite long, and
so can their common match part.  In this situation it can
sometimes help to tell Icicles to hide the common match part.
User option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag|icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag]]</tt>''''
controls whether this part is hidden, in the `*Completions*'
display.  You can toggle this option from the minibuffer anytime
using '''`##C-x .##''''

Some '''Icicles''' [[multi-command]]s that typically display long candidates
automatically turn this option on, to hide the common match
portion, for clarity.  This is the case for file-finding commands
that expect an absolute file name.  Just use `##C-x .##' to turn
hiding off again.

You can control which commands do this, by adding/removing
property '''`icicle-hide-common-match'''' to/from the command symbol.
For example, command `icicle-locate-file' has the non-`nil'
property by default.  If you do not want this command to hide the
common match then add this to your [[init file]] (##~/.emacs##):


    (put 'icicle-locate-file 'icicle-hide-common-match nil)


But just what is meant by the '''[::expanded common match]''' that '''Icicles'''
finds?  It is the longest match of your input pattern that is ''common to all candidates''
and also ''contains the first input match'' in the ''first or second candidate'', whichever is longer.

For apropos completion, this is not always the longest common
match of your input, but in most cases it is, and it is quicker to compute.  In
general, the longest common match does not necessarily contain the
first match of your input with either the first candidate or the
second candidate.  It might contain a different input match from
the first in both the first and second candidates.

For example, with input `a' and candidates `abacb', `abbac', and
`bacba' (in that order), `bac' is the longest common match.  But
`a' is the longest common match that contains the first match in
the first candidate.  It is the second match of `a' against
`abacb' that yields `bac'.  Likewise for the second candidate: it
is the second match of `a' against `abbac' that yields `bac'.

So in this case '''Icicles''' will use `a' as the expanded input and miss the longest common
match.  If the candidate order is different, so that `bacba' is
either the first or the second candidate, then '''Icicles''' finds the
longest common match, because the first match of `a' against
`bacba' yields `bac'.

The reason that '''Icicles''' common-match expansion typically finds the
longest common match is that your input typically matches the
first or the second candidate in only one place.  And the longer the input you
type, the more likely this is.  In practice, it is only with very
short input such as `a' that '''Icicles''' expansion sometimes misses
the longest common match. '''Icicles''' independently tries two candidates (first and second) as
its starting point, to increase the probability of finding the
longest common match.

It is also technically incorrect to speak of "''the''" longest common
match: in general, there can be more than one.  For example, if
the input is `a' and the candidates are `abab', `abba', and
`baba', then both `ab' and `ba' are longest common substrings.
Again, however, for typical input and typical candidates there is
a single longest common match, and '''Icicles''' finds it.

Note that '''Icicles''' expanded common match is not just a common
substring among all of the candidates that are matched by your
input pattern.  It is a substring common to all candidates matched
by your input, but a substring that also ''matches your input''.  For
example, with apropos completion input `##a.z##' and candidates `abz' and `apz', there is
''no'' expanded common match.  The substring `a' is common to both
candidates, but it is not matched by the (complete) input pattern.

(Note that in Emacs 20 no common match is found if your
input or any of the candidates contains binary data.  This is
because function `string-match' cannot handle strings with binary
data in Emacs 20.)

Here is a screenshot showing the highlighting of the extended common match in the [[minibuffer]] and in [[buffer]] `*Completions*'.
