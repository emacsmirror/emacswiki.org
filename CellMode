=About=

Cell-mode implements an abstract spreadsheet control in an Emacs buffer.

As of 2019 %%CellMode%% is in development again and has undergone substantial revision. The current URL is https://gitlab.com/dto/cell-mode

The project page describes %%CellMode%% as follows:

"Cell-mode is an object-oriented spreadsheet control for GNU Emacs. It
provides a major mode for spreadsheet-based user interfaces; it can be
further extended by defining application-specific Emacs Lisp minor
modes which supply new cell and spreadsheet classes via Emacsâ€™
included object system, EIEIO."
