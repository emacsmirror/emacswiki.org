= Trac Wiki editor in Emacs =

I have written a very simple editor for [[http://trac.edgewall.org/ the Trac Wiki]].

The Elisp relies on a python file which implements the xmlrpc for doing the editing. This gets around Emacs lack of threading pretty neatly.

Here's the source of the elisp which you can also [[http://making.woome.com/repos/nics-emacs-bits/raw-file/3532eddb4931/trac.el download from here]]:

{{{
;; trac.el a simple wrapper around a command line trac tool
;; Nic Ferrier <nferrier@woome.com>

;; Todo:: 
;;
;; define derived mode from text-mode 
;;    with a keybinding of C-x C-w for save to trac
;;
;; delete the put buffer after the put has finished
;;    need another sentinel

;; Depends
;;
;; Nic's trac.py command line tool for trac
;;
;; xmlrpc interface for trac.

;; Usage
;; 
;; Login first with 
;;
;;   trac.py loginemacs
;;
;; or use an ini file to supply authentication details (see trac.py --help)
;;
;; To get a wiki page:
;;
;;   M-x trac-get <wikipagename>
;;
;; eg:
;;
;;   M-x trac-get releases
;;
;; gets the releases page


(defvar trac-page-meta '()
  "Used to store buffer local variable about each page")

(defun trac-get-sentinel (process signal)
  (cond
   ((equal signal "finished\n")
    (switch-to-buffer (buffer-name (process-buffer process)))
    (beginning-of-buffer)
    (let ((meta-data (read (current-buffer))))
      (if (listp meta-data)
	  (progn
	    (beginning-of-buffer)
	    (kill-sexp)
	    (kill-line)))
      (text-mode)
      (auto-fill-mode)
      ;; Has to be set here because mode-sets trash them
      (make-local-variable 'trac-page-meta)
      (setq trac-page-meta meta-data))))
    )

(defun trac-save (page-meta)
  "Save the current trac buffer back to trac

Uses the page meta-data collected from the retrieval so expects
to use a buffer that was the result of that call."
  (interactive (list trac-page-meta))
  (if (not page-meta)
      (error "not in a trac page buffer!")
    (let ((page-name (plist-get
		      (plist-get page-meta :tracwikiproperties)
		      :name)))
      (let ((p (start-process-shell-command 
		"trac-wiki-put"
		(concat "*trac-wiki-put-channel-" page-name "*")
		"/home/nferrier/woome/sysops/dev/trac.py"
		"wikiput"
		page-name)))
	(process-send-region p (point-min) (point-max))
	(process-send-eof p)))))

(defun trac-get (page)
  "Get the wiki page specified into a buffer

The meta data associated with the page is removed from the page
content and made into a buffer local variable."
  (interactive "Mtrac page:")
  (let ((p (start-process-shell-command 
	    "trac-wiki-get"
	    (concat "*trac-wiki-channel-" page "*")
	    "/home/nferrier/woome/sysops/dev/trac.py"
	    "wiki"
	    page)))
    (set-process-sentinel p 'trac-get-sentinel)
    ))

;; End
}}}


The python file that this depends on is [[http://making.woome.com/repos/nics-emacs-bits/raw-file/3532eddb4931/trac.py here]]. It's still rather WooMe specific... but is usable enough.


== Note ==

This is not the only editor for trac's Wiki. There is a completly [[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/EmacsWikiEditScript Emacs implementation using Emacs' XMLRPC library]]. I couldn't get that one to work over SSL however and I find Emacs lack of threading a pain for important things like that.
