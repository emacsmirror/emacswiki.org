Unicode Consortium made the controversial decision to map multiple different glyphs onto the same Unicode code point.

In their opinion, these national variants essentially represent the same {HanZi, Kanji, Hanja} character and are therefore merged.

The computer should then be able to select the correct variant by using system locale information and different fonts.  Such as

* Noto Sans Mono CJK JP
* Noto Sans Mono CJK SC
* Noto Sans Mono CJK TC

However, in the case that the system locale is not set to that of a CJK country -- commonly set to American English en-US.UTF8 -- Emacs default to Japanese variant of the glyph.  Which is inconvenient for native readers of Simplified Chinese.

= Select a National Variant in Emacs =

We make use of fallback fonts.  That is, the font used for the Latin alphabet remain unchanged.  We only select the font for Han characters.

= Select Default Font for Latin Alphabet =

Use Menu bar (or M-`) - Options - Set Default Font to set a default font for latin alphabet.

Use Menu bar (or M-`) - Options - Save Option to save the changes in your init file.

It should be similar to the following:

 (custom-set-faces
  '(default ((t (:family "JuliaMono" :foundry "corm" :slant normal :weight regular :height 113 :width normal)))))

= Select Fallback Font for Han Script =

Now, use =C-h v face-font-family-alternatives= to set the correct national variant as fallback font for Han Script, and save the changes:

 (custom-set-variables
  '(face-font-family-alternatives
   ; this line is added for simplified chinese in mainland china
   '(("JuliaMono" "Noto Sans Mono CJK SC")
   ; this are the default values
     ("Monospace" "courier" "fixed")
      ("Monospace Serif" "Courier 10 Pitch" "Consolas" "Courier Std"
       "FreeMono" "Nimbus Mono L" "courier" "fixed")
      ("courier" "CMU Typewriter Text" "fixed")
      ("Sans Serif" "helv" "helvetica" "arial" "fixed")
      ("helv" "helvetica" "arial" "fixed")))


You're done.

= Android Emacs =
For Android, you need to download CJK TTF font file to ~/fonts of the Emacs Application Storage, then follow the same steps above.

See this page: https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk/tree/main/Sans

Only TTF is supported by Android Emacs.
