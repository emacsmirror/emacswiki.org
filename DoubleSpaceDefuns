Here's my function to insert/remove lines between function definitions so that there is exactly 1 blank line separating them:

(defun double-space-defuns ()
  (interactive "*")
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (search-forward "defun" nil t)
      (end-of-defun)
      (cond ((and (line-empty-p) (line-empty-p 2))
             (delete-blank-lines))
            ((not (line-empty-p))
             (insert-string "\n"))))))

(defun line-empty-p (&optional offset)
  (= (line-beginning-position offset)
     (line-end-position offset)))
