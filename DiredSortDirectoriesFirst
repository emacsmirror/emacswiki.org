It seems pretty hard to achieve this simple task in Linux as the gnu-ls-command don't know any option to sort in this way. That lisp-code from the usenet looks hacky, but who cares - it works!

<pre>
(defun sof/dired-sort ()
  "Dired sort hook to list directories first."
  (save-excursion
   (let (buffer-read-only)
     (forward-line 2) ;; beyond dir. header  
     (sort-regexp-fields t "^.*$" "[ ]*." (point) (point-max))))
  (and (featurep 'xemacs)
       (fboundp 'dired-insert-set-properties)
       (dired-insert-set-properties (point-min) (point-max)))
  (set-buffer-modified-p nil))

 (add-hook 'dired-after-readin-hook 'sof/dired-sort)
</pre>

Here is a better method that is based on the above code, but doesn't break after adding marks (and pressing 'g').

<pre>
(defun mydired-sort ()
  "Sort dired listings with directories first."
  (save-excursion
    (let (buffer-read-only)
      (forward-line 2) ;; beyond dir. header 
      (sort-regexp-fields t "^.*$" "[ ]*." (point) (point-max)))
    (set-buffer-modified-p nil)))

(defadvice dired-readin
  (after dired-after-updating-hook first () activate)
  "Sort dired listings with directories first before adding marks."
  (mydired-sort))
</pre>

See DiredSortMenu for info on FrancisWright's library <code>dired-sort-menu.el</code>. It lets you do this and much, much more. -- DrewAdams
