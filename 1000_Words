: "Can you explain a hard idea
using only the ten hundred most used words? it's not very
easy. Type in the box to try it out." -- [http://splasho.com/upgoer5/ The Up-Goer Five Text Editor]

Back when I learned English, I was told that I'd be able to understand 80% of all English using the most common 2000 words only. I have no idea whether it's true or not.

This package provides two modes derived from Text Mode: `1000-words-mode' and `2000-words-mode'.
