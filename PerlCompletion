Lisp:perl-completion.el - minor mode provides useful features for editing perl codes

== What is perl-completion.el  ==
perl-completion.el is a minor mode which provides several useful features such as variable/method/module code completion, easy perldoc browsing, and more described below in your perl-mode.

This module is one of anything application [AnythingApplications] .
So that means anything.el is required to run this elisp. please install anything.el first unless you already have.

=== Screen cast is available ===
My English is not so good, so I made a screencast.

[http://vimeo.com/4739908 Screen Cast(vimeo)]


== Installation ==
=== Traditional way ===
drop perl-completion.el into a directory in your `load-path' and byte-compile it.

=== with install-elisp.el ===
If you have install-elisp.el, you can install perl-completion.el very easily.

Run code showed below to install perl-completion.el

    (install-elisp "http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/perl-completion.el")

See [InstallElisp] for more detail.

And auto-install.el is similar to install-elisp.el.
See [AutoInstall] for more detail.

=== Emacs version ===
perl-completion.el needs emacs version higher than 22.

=== requires libraries ===
requires emacs lisps are,

* Lisp:anything.el
* Lisp:anything-match-plugin.el

perl-completion.el does not really depend on anything-match-plugin.el.

But I strongly recommend you to install anything-match-plugin.el
because anything.el becomes more powerfull with anything-match-plugin.el.

Lisp:anything-match-plugin.el enables you to narrow select candidates by multiple words or regexp! -- from [AnythingApplications]


== Configuration ==
=== Default configuration ===
perl-completion.el is minor-mode for cperl-mode.
so, settings (loading and configs) are typically written in `cperl-mode-hook'.

below are configuration sample.
put these lines into your .emacs file (or something like .emacs file)

=== sample setting ===
<pre>
(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook
          (lambda()
            (require 'perl-completion)
            (perl-completion-mode t)))
</pre>


=== cooperation with auto-complete.el ===
perl-completion.el export `ac-source-perl-completion' to cooperate with auto-complete.el
add this variable to `ac-sources', perl-completion's candidates(perl keywords.methos,functions,variables,etc...) will appear in auto-complete's popup window.

here's sample configrations.
load auto-complete.el and add `ac-source-perl-completion' to `ac-sources', when cperl-mode is on.

Note, ac-sources was made buffer local in new versions of auto-complete.el(i'm not sure exactly version.but ver0.1,`ac-sources' is not "buffer local variable" at least).
      so in example, call `make-variable-buffer-local' to make buffer local variable expressly.

=== sample setting ===
<pre>
(add-hook  'cperl-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
             (when (require 'auto-complete nil t) ; no error whatever auto-complete.el is not installed.
               (auto-complete-mode t)
               (make-variable-buffer-local 'ac-sources)
               (setq ac-sources
                     '(ac-source-perl-completion)))))
</pre>

=== To get more infomation about auto-complete.el ===
see [AutoComplete] more detail.


== Extend find-file ==
perl-completion extends Emacs builtin find-file.

after (require 'perl-completion),
find-file-at-point (C-x C-f bind to find-file-at-point by default) is able to find installed perl module, when perl-completion-mode is on.

== Accessing Documentation ==
perl-completion.el provide some commands to open perldoc from installed modules.

* Open perldoc
* Open Module source

see "Default Keybind" -> "documents support commands" section for more detail.

== Commands ==
Commands description.

=== Format ===
[Default Keybind] command-name

=== Completion Commands ===
==== [C-c C-c a] plcmp-cmd-complete-all ====
invoke anything with all completion sources.
difference between this command and `plcmp-cmd-smart-complete'
is this command doesn't sort candidates smartly.


==== [C-RET] plcmp-cmd-smart-complete ====
[<C-return>] plcmp-cmd-smart-complete
[M-TAB] plcmp-cmd-smart-complete

complete all completion sources.
completions are smartly sorted.

e.x,
when invoke command context like: (cursor is `!!')

<pre>
use LWP::UserAgent;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
$ua->`!!'
</pre>

LWP::UserAgent's methods are shown at the top of candidates.

this is the main command of perl-completion.el!!.

==== [C-c v] plcmp-cmd-complete-variables ====
invoke anything with only variables completion source.

==== [C-c a] plcmp-cmd-complete-arrays ====
invoke anything with only array completion source.

==== [C-c h] plcmp-cmd-complete-hashes ====
invoke anything with only hash completion source.

==== [C-c f] plcmp-cmd-complete-functions ====
invoke anything with only function completion source.

==== [C-c m] plcmp-cmd-complete-methods ====
invoke anything with only using module's methods completion source.

==== [C-c i] plcmp-cmd-complete-modules ====
invoke anything with only installed modules completion source.

=== documents support commands ===
==== [C-c d] plcmp-cmd-show-doc ====
invoke anything with installed modules and man pages about perl.

default action is "Show doc" that open selected candidate's document.

e.x,
[module]
If selected DBIx::Class::ResultSet, open perldoc.
[manpage]
If selected perlop open manpage using `woman'

press TAB to select other Actions.

==== [C-c s] plcmp-cmd-show-doc-at-point ====
same as `plcmp-cmd-show-doc'.
only difference, word at point is used as initial-pattern.

=== Other Commands ===
==== [C-c c] plcmp-cmd-clear-all-caches ====
remove all caches
rebuild installed modules list asynchronously. as soon as called this command.
caches are,
* installed modules
* methods
* perl buffers last modified time. (used detect buffer is changed since last completion command is invoked
                                    other-perl-buffer-source doesn't try to get completions non modified buffer).

this command usually used, when you install new module from something like CPAN after once perl-completion-mode is on.

Internally, this command sets these variables to `nil'.
* `plcmp-other-perl-buffers-cache-hash'
* `plcmp-module-methods-alist'
* `plcmp-installed-modules'

==== [C-c C-c s] plcmp-cmd-show-environment ====
print infomations to *perl-completion show environment* buffer
environment,
perl-completion's customize variables,
perl-completion's commands and where bound to,
and value of PERL5LIB.

this command is good for debugging.

==== [C-c M] plcmp-cmd-menu ====
show perl-completion's menu.

this quite useful when before you remember perl-completion's keybinds.

=== Commands support perl programing ===
==== plcmp-cmd-eval-buffer ====
Run current buffer string as Perl code asynchronously.
when finished, popup result buffer.
the result buffer is named *perl output*.

==== plcmp-cmd-eval-on-region ====
Run selected region as Perl code asynchronously.
when finished, popup result buffer.
the result buffer is named *perl output*.

If run perl process is exit with nonzero status, using `switch-to-buffer' instead of `pop-to-buffer'

== Customize Variables ==
=== plcmp-lib-directory-re ===
regexp to detect directory that automatically added to PERL5LIB when build completions.

e.x,
If you are editting file at "~/dev/SomeModule/lib/SomeModule/Hoge.pm",
"~/dev/SomeModule/lib/" is added to PERL5LIB when invoke completion commands.

default value is "lib/"

=== plcmp-use-keymap ===
If this value is nil,
perl-completion-mode doesn't use own key-map.

it is useful if you want to use own keybind,
or don't like default keybinds.

Note, keymap is defined at library loading phase.
so this variables's value should be set before `require'.

e.x,
<pre>
;; OK, dont use default keybinds.
(setq plcmp-use-keymap nil)
(require 'perl-completion)


;; NG when `plcmp-use-keymap' is set, plcmp-mode-map is defined already.
(require 'perl-completion)
(setq plcmp-use-keymap nil)
</pre>


=== plcmp-extra-using-modules ===
list of String or Alist

If value is String(module name),
module name is always appear in candidates.

If value is Alist ("module-name" . "extra-module-name"),
and module-name is using in current buffer,
extra-module-name's methods are appear in candidates.

e.x,
<pre>
(setq plcmp-extra-using-modules '("DBIx::Class::ResultSet"))
(setq plcmp-extra-using-modules '(("LWP::UserAgent" . "HTTP::Response")))
;; also can both of them
(setq plcmp-extra-using-modules '("DBIx::Class::ResultSet" ("LWP::UserAgent" . "HTTP::Response")))
</pre>

=== plcmp-perl-buffer-re ===
Regexp

To Detect buffer is perl buffer or not.

default value is "\\.[pP][lmLM]$"

=== plcmp-other-perl-buffer-limit-number ===
Number

how many buffers get buffer words `plcmp-get-sources-other-perl-buffers-words'.

default value is 30

=== plcmp-module-filter-list ===
list of String(module name)

module is not appear in method completion list.

default value is '("strict" "warning")

=== plcmp-additional-PERL5LIB-directories ===
list of String(directory)

directory is added to PERL5LIB when invoke completion commands.

=== plcmp-coding-system ===
If this value is not nil,
value is bind to `coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write' temporary around these commands:
* `plcmp-cmd-eval-buffer'
* `plcmp-cmd-eval-buffer-and-go'
* `plcmp-cmd-eval-on-region'


== FAQ ==
=== I don't like default keybind ===
If you don't wanna use default keybind,
set `plcmp-use-keymap' to `nil',
then perl-completion-mode doesn't use own key-map any more.

Note, keymap is defined at library loading phase.

=== I want to use perl-completion's commands everywhere ===
you can use `global-set-key' to define global key.
e.x,
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-p") 'plcmp-cmd-show-doc)

see Commands section for command list.
