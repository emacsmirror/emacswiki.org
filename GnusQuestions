== Where to find the FAQs (frequently asked questions)==

They are included with Gnus. Use <code>C-h i m gnus RET</code> to see Gnus' info page.
You can also see the list of questions on-line in [http://gnus.org/manual/gnus_toc.html Gnus manual] (look for section 10.9 or so).
If you download the CVS version ([[GnusCvs]]), the FAQs are in the file gnus-faq.texi.

== Some Newbie Questions of a long-time VM user ==
Many, many pieces of documentation are living in the web concerning Gnus.  Funny, though, that they always seem to show the same thing.  Currently I'm not so sure, whether I am just plain stupid, or the questions that I've got are too far from the real world.  So I won't open a new wiki page for the moment and instead collect them here.

* After importing all my old mail using the "G f INBOX, M P b, B r nnml"-method described so often, how do I make my mail groups show up? Gnus seems to know about all those mail.*-directories that were created using a fancy split when I hit the j key, but L does nothing.  
** F (gnus-group-find-new-groups)
*** Uhm, no?  It does nothing for me, sorry.  Does that function look for new nnml-directories as groups or just on a news-server?
** ^ (gnus-group-enter-server-mode) will list available groups.

* Do I have to really subscribe all the groups that I want to read, or is there some magic, so that any group created automatically by fance-splitting will be displayed.  The fancy I do is along:

 (setq nnmail-split-fancy
      '(|
        (from ".*agood@friendofmine.de" "mail.private.thegoodfriend")
        (subject "[SPAM]" "mail.spam")
        (to ".*my@privateaddress\\.de" "mail.private.misc")
        (to "me@mycompany\\.de"
            (from ".* <?\\(.*\\)@mycompany.de" "mail.office.\\1"))
        ("mail.inbox")
        ))

* Is there any way to geht the groups buffer showing together with the summary and message buffer, like so:

 +------------------------------------+
 |  groups     | summary              |
 |    buffer   |      buffer          |
 +------------------------------------+
 |  message display                   |
 |  very large: want to see           |
 |     it all ....                    |
 +------------------------------------+

** This is in section 8.5 of the manual (that's (info "(gnus)window layout")), page 234 of the .pdf (slaughter you a forest, forasmuch as to print TFM).
C-h v gnus-buffer-configuration shows the arbitrarily recursive nature of window configurations for Gnus.
When I grow up and flex my potent Lispology, I think this would be a splendid opportunity for some macro-fu,
so that mortals could define a simple table of measurements and let the code manage itself.  -- ChristopherSmith

** You could try this, and change some of the numbers:

    (gnus-add-configuration
     '(article
       (vertical 1.0
    	       (horizontal 8
    			 (group 20)
    			 (summary 1.0 point) )
    	       (horizontal 1.0
    			 (article 1.0)))))


* What is the supposed way to just read mail and no news at all?
  Currently I have

  (setq gnus-select-method '(nnml ""))

: and no secondary-select-method at all, but I feel it's not right.

* Who is this stupid asking all this basic stuff anyone knows anyway?  -- StefanKamphausen (thankful for any pointers ;-) )


== LDAP support? ==
   
   Please see the updated [[EUDC]] Wiki page.  Many of the below bug fixes have been committed to Emacs 25.

[new]
I'm pondering the benefits of using Gnus for my mailer (and newsreader) over my current MUA. Is it possible to read and write to an existing addressbook using LDAP? I have read a little about EUCD, but I cant seem to find any good documentation about this. What I need is to have my mail and addressbook accessable via IMAP and LDAP, and BBDB seems to use its own format. Perhaps its even possible to use LDAP as a backend to BBDB? --HenrikHolmboe

[new]
: I don't think such code exists.  But look for ldap.el in the WikifiedEmacsLispList...  Perhaps that helps?

[new]
:: ldap.el seems to be an alternative to EUCD, which relies on the binary ldapsearch. I will have to check this out. --HenrikHolmboe

[new]

: I am using EUDC with a MS LDAP server for email address completion. I have come accross a number of problems but now have it working:

* Suumary: ldap.el (that I have on Gentoo linux shipped with emacs-21.4, not the ldap.el on the WikifiedEmacsLispList...)  does not work natively, there are problems with it and changes in the way ldapsearch works since ldap.el was originally written
* ldapsearch can wrap long lines so I use a wrapper script that gets rid of them called myldapsearch:
<pre> 
#!/bin/sh
ldapsearch $* | perl -p0e 's/\n //g'
</pre>
* I had to change the regexp and the command args to ldapsearch (actually myldapsearch wrapper)
