I use Emacs.

* John uses  GNU Emacs 26.1 on Win10 and Linux at home
* At work I use GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0, NS appkit-1348.17 Version 10.10.5 (Build 14F2511))

I use Emacs both at home and at work.

Because I have been subjected to numerous older development environments my desire for full-screen editors caused me at one time to write my own editors.  During my tour of duty as a programmer and analyst I ran across all the usual editor suspects until I dove into Emacs in the late 90's and really never looked back.  I'm learning elisp at the same pace as Emacs development ;-)

I doubt I'll ever completely get rid of Emacs because I keep finding more uses for it.  At home I do a little C and Python programming and HTML (in Emacs).  And for super-trivial Java stuff I find Emacs works easier than firing up my IDE (NetBeans).  If I ever get around to writing a novel I'll be using Emacs exclusively.  There's a lot to be said for a stable editor, and I consider Emacs to be a stable editor.

My function keys (including S-fn and C-fn) are customized.  The latest fad of mine is to assign about 4-6 of my S-fx to find-file my most frequent directories where my current work is.  For example I mapped C-f1 to open my .emacs for editing and inspection.  My latest use for Emacs in an IT environment involves Muse, a work diary, calendar, calculator and a few other builtin modes.  No toolbar and no menubar; just the main editing area, the status line and the command line.

Emacs being slow or resource hungry comes from people who try using Emacs as if it was still vi (or any other standalone text editor) and not as the user-level "operating system" (programmable and multi-purpose) that it is and should be.  Welcome. --AaronHawley

Emacs is open enough to be just about <b>anything</b> a power user wishes it to be.  I'm glad for that.
