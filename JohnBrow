Because I have been subjected to numerous older development environments my desire for full-screen editors caused me at one time to write my own editors.  During my tour of duty as a programmer and analyst I ran across all the usual editor suspects until I dove into Emacs in the late 1990's and really never looked back.  I'm learning elisp at the same pace as Emacs development ;-)

I've found Org-Mode to be extremely useful.  

My function keys (including S-fn and C-fn) are customized.  The latest fad of mine is to assign about 4-6 of my S-fx to find-file my most frequent directories where my current work is.  For example I mapped C-f1 to open my .emacs for editing and inspection.    No toolbar and no menu bar; just the main editing area, the status line and the command line.  For complex mass editing of data I start a macro with f5 (kmacro-start-macro), perform the editing operations once, S-f5 to end the macro (kmacro-end-macro) or f9 to execute the macro (kmacro-end-and-call-macro).  Very useful for those one-off repetitive edits!

Emacs being slow or resource hungry comes from people who try using Emacs as if it was still vi (or any other standalone text editor) and not as the user-level "operating system" (programmable and multi-purpose) that it is and should be.  Welcome. --AaronHawley

Emacs is open enough to be just about <b>anything</b> a power user wishes it to be.  I'm glad for that.
