Note: There have been some backward-incompatible changes in 2011-06-29
and some of the configuration options used in previous versions do not
work anymore. The previous "spelling suggestions" feature has been
generalized to "actions" feature. Now user can configure any kind of
actions for marked text, not just spelling suggestions. Please read the
documentation of variable `wcheck-language-data' and ##README## text in the
source repository.


== Introduction ==

Wcheck mode is a general-purpose text-checker interface for Emacs text
editor. Wcheck mode a minor mode which provides an on-the-fly text
checker. It checks the visible text area, as you type, and possibly
highlights some parts of it. What is checked and how are all
configurable.

Wcheck mode can use external programs or Emacs Lisp functions for
checking text. For example, Wcheck mode can be used with spell-checker
programs such as Ispell, Enchant and Hunspell, but actually any tool
that can receive text from standard input stream and send text to
standard output can be used. Wcheck mode sends parts of buffer's content
to an external program or an Emacs Lisp function and, based on their
output, decides if some parts of text should be marked in the buffer.


== Features ==

In Wcheck mode's configuration different configuration units are called
"languages". In terms of a spelling checker it is natural to think of
them as different human languages. Wcheck mode is not limited to that,
though. Language is just a configuration unit for certain kind of text
checking purpose.

Each language can use its own checker engine (external program or a
function), command-line arguments and other settings, such as the
regular expressions and syntax table that are used to match words (or
other text elements) in Emacs buffer. User can choose which "face" is
used to mark text elements in buffer.

User can create language-specific and major mode specific settings
defining which "faces" to read or skip in buffers. A typical use for
this feature is to spell-check only those areas in buffer which are
written in the target language. For example, in email messages usually
the message body and Subject header are important enough to spell-check.
In programming modes user could spell-check only documentation strings
and comments (or the opposite if you want to use Wcheck mode to check
keywords and syntax of the programming language itself).

Wcheck mode can also be configured to offer any kind of actions for
marked text. Actions are presented to user through a menu which is
activated either by (1) clicking the right mouse button on a marked text
or (2) executing interactive command `wcheck-actions' while the cursor
(the point) is on a marked text.

If you use Wcheck mode as a spelling checker then it's natural to
configure an action menu that offers spelling suggestions for the
misspelled word. The action menu could also have an option to add the
marked word to spell-checker's dictionary, so that the word is
recognized in the future. That's only one application for Wcheck mode,
though. Wcheck mode can be configured to find almost any kind of text
elements from buffer, mark them, and offer any kind of actions for
marked text.


== How does it compare to other spell-checkers? ==

The open design makes Wcheck mode (internally) quite different from
spell-checkers like Flyspell mode and Speck mode. They are specific
tools for spell-checking through Ispell or compatible program and are
therefore very much tied to Ispell's features and command-line
interface. This can be useful if you want to use Ispell or fully
compatible program for spell-checking natural languages. However, not
all human languages can be supported through Ispell and there can also
be other kind of text-checking needs.

The motivation behind Wcheck mode is to offer more general-purpose and
configurable interface for text checking. It can be configured to work
with almost anything: user's custom shell, Awk or Perl scripts, Lisp
functions or other checkers and text filters. Even if you only need a
spelling checker for human languages Wcheck mode can be a good choice.
It has more configuration possibilities than other spell-checkers and
the on-the-fly checker performs very well. It's a true real-time
checker.


== Install ==

Put ##wcheck-mode.el## file to some directory in your Emacs's `load-path'
and add the following lines to Emacs's initialization file (##~/.emacs##):

    (autoload 'wcheck-mode "wcheck-mode"
      "Toggle wcheck-mode." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-change-language "wcheck-mode"
      "Switch wcheck-mode languages." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-actions "wcheck-mode"
      "Open actions menu." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-jump-forward "wcheck-mode"
      "Move point forward to next marked text area." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-jump-backward "wcheck-mode"
      "Move point backward to previous marked text area." t)


== Configuration and basic usage ==

The internal documentation of variable `wcheck-language-data' has a
complete description on how to configure Wcheck mode language data. For
easy configuration you can use the options in the customize group named
##wcheck## (##M-x customize-group RET wcheck RET##).

It might be convenient to bind Wcheck mode commands to some easily
accessible keys, for example:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'wcheck-mode)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'wcheck-change-language)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'wcheck-actions)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'wcheck-jump-forward)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'wcheck-jump-backward)

Interactive command `wcheck-mode' toggles the text-checker for the
current buffer. Command `wcheck-change-language' is used to switch
languages and command `wcheck-actions' (or the right mouse button) opens
an actions menu for marked text. Commands `wcheck-jump-forward' and
`wcheck-jump-backward' jump to next or previous marked text area.


== Examples ==

See the [https://github.com/tlikonen/wcheck-mode 
README] file for configuration examples. Wcheck mode users are encouraged
to put their configuration examples here, though.
