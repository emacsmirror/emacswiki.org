Lisp:wcheck-mode.el

== Introduction ==

Wcheck mode is a general-purpose text-checker interface for Emacs. It's a minor mode for on-the-fly (spell-)checking and marking words or other text elements in Emacs buffers.

Wcheck mode can use external programs or Emacs Lisp functions for checking text. For example, Wcheck mode can be used with spell-checker programs such as Enchant, Ispell and Hunspell, but actually any tool that can receive text from standard input stream and send text to standard output can be used. Wcheck sends parts of buffer's content to an external program or an Emacs Lisp function and, based on their output, decides if some parts of text should be marked in the buffer.

== Features ==

In terms of spelling checker and user interface Wcheck mode is an on-the-fly checker which can also offer spelling suggestions (corrections) when asked. In Wcheck mode different configuration units are called languages. They don't have to be human languages, though. Language is just a configuration unit for certain kind of text checking purpose.

Each language can use its own checker engine (external program or a function), command-line arguments and other settings, such as the regular expressions and syntax table that are used to match words (or other text elements) in Emacs buffer. The on-the-fly checker can use different program than the spelling correction feature. User can choose which "face" is used to mark text elements in buffer. All the settings are language-specific and user is free to interpret the semantics of text analyzing: it's left open what marked text elements in the buffer actually mean. When using Wcheck mode as a spelling checker we usually think of marked words as misspellings.

User can create language and major mode specific settings defining which "faces" to read or skip in buffers. A typical use for this feature is to spell-check only those areas in buffer which are written in human language. For example, in email messages usually the message body and Subject header are important enough to spell-check. In programming modes user could spell-check only documentation strings and comments (or the opposite if you want to use Wcheck mode to check keywords and syntax of the programming language itself).

== How does it compare to other spell-checkers? ==

The open design makes Wcheck mode (internally) quite different from spell-checkers like [[FlySpell]] and [[SpeckMode]]. They are specific tools for spell-checking through Ispell or compatible program and are therefore very much tied to Ispell's features and command-line interface. This can be useful if you want to use Ispell or fully compatible program for spell-checking natural languages. However, not all human languages can be supported through Ispell and there can also be other kind of text-checking needs.

The motivation behind Wcheck mode is to offer more general-purpose and configurable interface for text checking. It can be configured to work with almost anything: user's custom shell, awk or perl scripts, Lisp functions or other checkers and text filters. Even if you only need a spelling checker for human languages Wcheck mode can be a good choice. It has more configuration possibilities than other spell-checkers and the on-the-fly checker performs very well. It's a true real-time checker.

== Install and configure ==

Put Lisp:wcheck-mode.el file to some directory in your Emacs's `load-path' and add the following lines to Emacs's initialization file (##~/.emacs##):

    (autoload 'wcheck-mode "wcheck-mode"
      "Toggle wcheck-mode." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-change-language "wcheck-mode"
      "Switch wcheck-mode languages." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-spelling-suggestions "wcheck-mode"
      "Spelling suggestions." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-jump-forward "wcheck-mode"
      "Move point forward to next marked text area." t)
    (autoload 'wcheck-jump-backward "wcheck-mode"
      "Move point backward to previous marked text area." t)

See the documentation of variable `wcheck-language-data' for information on how to configure Wcheck mode. For easy configuration you can use the options in customize group named "wcheck" (##M-x customize-group RET wcheck RET##). Interactive command `wcheck-mode' toggles the text-checker in the current buffer. Command `wcheck-change-language' is used to switch languages and command `wcheck-spelling-suggestions' (or right mouse button) gives spelling suggestion for marked text (if the suggestion program is properly configured). Commands `wcheck-jump-forward' and `wcheck-jump-backward' jump to next or previous marked text area.

It might be convenient if Wcheck commands are bound to some easily accessible keys, for example:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'wcheck-mode)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'wcheck-change-language)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'wcheck-spelling-suggestions)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'wcheck-jump-forward)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'wcheck-jump-backward)

Below is an example configuration for spell-checking languages Finnish (using Enchant) and British English (using Ispell). The default language will be "Finnish". There are also two non-human languages: "Trailing whitespace" is a checker which highlights trailing whitespace characters in lines and "Highlight FIXMEs" highlights FIXME words if they appear in comments in `emacs-lisp-mode' or `c-mode' (or anywhere in other modes). The example also configures some global defaults for all languages. For example, text-checkers will read only certain buffer areas (faces) in `emacs-lisp-mode', `c-mode' and `message-mode'.

== Questions and Other Things ==

Are there any grammar checkers available that you can use with this?

Suggestion: Write your example using `( ... ) so that you can for example write ,ispell-program-name instead of "/usr/bin/ispell".

[new]

: Using variable `ispell-program-name' with ##`()## construct may be a good idea for some individuals' configuration but, in my opinion, not as a general example. The reason is that the variable is not defined by default: it exists only after Emacs ispell package is loaded.
