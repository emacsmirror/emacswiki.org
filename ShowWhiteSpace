This page is about making particular whitespace characters stand out better.

Emacs comes with a standard solution: ##M-x whitespace-mode##.
See WhiteSpace. 

== Some Details ==

GNU Emacs 24 has internal variable `nobreak-char-display' (turned on by default), which highlights hard space and hard hyphen characters.  But the face is hardwired, and you cannot highlight only one of these chars. 

GNU Emacs 22 or later has library ##whitespace.el##, which lets you highlight whitespace in several ways.

GNU Emacs 21 or later provides the [[option]] `show-trailing-whitespace' to
highlight trailing whitespace in face `trailing-whitespace'.

== CPerl ==

CPerl shows trailing whitespace by default.
You can specify the face to use for trailing whitespace.
You can use face `default' for invisible whitespace, if you don't care about trailing whitespace:

{{{
(setq cperl-invalid-face 'default)
}}}

[:HighlightChars]
== highlight-chars.el ==

(Library <tt>[[highlight-chars.el]]</tt> replaces obsolete library <tt>[[show-wspace.el]]</tt>.)

Library <tt>[[highlight-chars.el]]</tt> lets you easily highlight any sets of characters that you choose, including whitespace characters.  There are commands and functions to use on hooks.

You can highlight whitespace and other easily confused characters: spaces, tabs, hard spaces, and hard hyphens, as well as trailing whitespace.

For example, command `hc-toggle-highlight-tabs' turns on/off highlighting of tab chars.  Or you can turn on tab highlighting by default by adding function `hc-highlight-tabs' to `font-lock-mode-hook' in your [[init file]]:

   (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'hc-highlight-tabs)

You can turn on/off the highlighting provided by library ##highlight-chars.el##:

* in the current buffer only (i.e., locally),
* globally whenever FontLockMode is turned on, or
* automatically whenever a buffer is in a given [[major mode]]



[::highlight.el]
=== Not Just Whitespace - Highlight Any Set of Characters ===

Unlike what is offered by libraries such as ##whitespace.el##, with library ##highlight-chars.el## you are not limited to whitespace highlighting.  You can highlight ''any set of characters''.  You can define the set using any number of entries of any of these kinds:

* string of chars
* range of successive chars (Emacs characters are integers)
* character class (e.g. ##[:nonascii:]##, ##[:space:]##)
* character set (e.g. `iso-8859-1' or `lao')

You can use any faces to do this.

In addition, you can ''exclude'' any set of characters from this highlighting.

You can thus, for example, highlight all characters in character
set `greek-iso8859-7' ''except'' `##GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMBDA##'.  Or all
characters in class ##[:space:]## (whitespace) ''except'' `tab'.  Or
all Unicode characters in the range ##?\u2190## through ##?\u21ff##
(mathematical arrows) ''except'' ##?\u21b6##, ##?\u21b7##, ##?\u21ba##, and
##?\u21bb## (curved arrows).  You get the idea.












== BlankMode ==

[[blank-mode.el]] (BlankMode) was a precursor to standard library ##whitespace.el## (see WhiteSpace) and has been replaced by it. When <code>blank-mode</code> is on, it looks like this:

[[image:BlankModeOn]]
 
%%BlankMode%% saves and restores the font-lock state when it is turned on and off. So, if %%BlankMode%% is turned on and font-lock is off, %%BlankMode%% also turns on the font-lock to highlight blanks, but font-lock is turned off when %%BlankMode%% is turned off. So turn on font-lock before %%BlankMode%%, if you want font-lock to stay on after %%BlankMode%% is turned off.







== Visible Whitespace Mode ==
[[visws.el]] - Simple and very easy to use.  Shows you tabs, spaces and newlines:

[[image:VisWS]]






== Red Space ==

Library <tt>[[redspace.el]]</tt> detects and highlights trailing whitespace.






== 80-Column Rule ==

EightyColumnRule provides highlighting of trailing spaces, TABs, and lines past column 80.





== Show Whitespace Minor Mode ==

ShowWhitespaceMode shows whitespace in either of two ways:

* using faces (highlighting)
* using typographical symbols (pilcrow for return, middle dot for space, guillmet for tab)







== Show Tabs in Modes ==

This code uses font-lock to highlight TABs with face `extra-whitespace-face' in `emacs-lisp-mode' and
in `text-mode'.  You can add an add-hook statement for every other mode
you want this for. Put the following in your init file:

 (defface extra-whitespace-face
   '((t (:background "pale green")))
   "Used for tabs and such.")

 (defvar my-extra-keywords
   '(("\t" . 'extra-whitespace-face)))

 (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
	   (lambda () (font-lock-add-keywords nil my-extra-keywords)))

 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
	   (lambda () (font-lock-add-keywords nil my-extra-keywords)))

[new]
To show tabs in the same color as trailing whitespace:

    ;; Draw tabs with the same color as trailing whitespace  
    (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook  
              (lambda ()  
                (font-lock-add-keywords  
                  nil  
                  '(("\t" 0 'trailing-whitespace prepend)))))






== Show TABs Using a String (^I) ==

To make TAB display as ##^I##, you can do this:

 (standard-display-ascii ?\t "^I")




== Show TAB with Wide Cursor ==

Customize `x-stretch-cursor' to non-`nil' to make the cursor as wide as the character it is over.



== Get Rid of Tabs ==

If you want to change spaces into TABs or the other way around, use
`M-x tabify' or `M-x untabify'.  See also NoTabs.
