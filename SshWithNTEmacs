It is possible but awkward to use cygwin SSH to access a Linux machine from within NTEmacs. This page gives some suggestions on how to get by without resorting to a cygwin Emacs. (I guess life might be easier using plink instead of ssh, but the server in my office doesn't seem to like it).

== SSH from a shell window ==
The Cygwin !OpenSSH client can be used to start an SSH session from the command line, and works fine when run from a DOS command prompt. However when run within an Emacs shell window it likes to give errors:

=== fakecygpty ===
As noted in the Cygwin archives[http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2001-11/msg00631.html], an NTEmacs build doesn't know how to present itself as a cygwin tty device when running cygwin commands. As a possible workaround, someone smart has come up with '''`fakecygpty''''[https://github.com/Shougo/fakecygpty/blob/master/fakecygpty.c]. When compiled from within cygwin according to the instructions, you get a nice little shim program which does present the expected tty interface. The command to run then becomes

  c:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs-24.3\bin>fakecygpty ssh my_server

which works nicely for me!

=== Xming ===

X forwarding with Xming[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming] can be used as usual to fire up graphical applications on the remote host. The DISPLAY environment variable may need some modification however:

  (setenv "DISPLAY" "localhost:0.0")
  ...
  c:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs-24.3\bin>fakecygpty ssh -X my_server

=== Convenience wrappers ===
Since "fakecygpty ssh" is a bit of an awkward command, these helper functions may be useful:

  (defun ssh (hostname &optional flags)
    "Start an SSH session in a shell window."
    (interactive "MSSH to host: ")
    (let ((buf (concat "*SSH:" hostname "*")))
      (if (and (get-buffer buf) (get-buffer-process buf))
          (switch-to-buffer-other-window buf)
        (async-shell-command (concat "fakecygpty ssh " flags (when flags " ") hostname) buf))))
  
  (defun sshx (hostname)
    "Start an SSH session with X11 forwarding in a shell window."
    (interactive "MSSH to host (X11): ")
    (ssh hostname "-X"))

== Tramp using cygwin SSH ==

If fakecygpty works from the shell, it should also work via tramp if you call "fakecygpty ssh" instead of just "ssh". This lisp snippet can be used to make a copy of the "sshx" method with the appropriate substitution:

  (eval-after-load "tramp"
    '(progn
       (add-to-list 'tramp-methods
                    (mapcar
                     (lambda (x)
                       (cond
                        ((equal x "sshx") "cygssh")
                        ((eq (car x) 'tramp-login-program) (list 'tramp-login-program "fakecygpty ssh"))
                        (t x)))
                     (assoc "sshx" tramp-methods)))
       (setq tramp-default-method "cygssh")))

<code>C-x d /myserver:</code> should then throw up a well-behaved password prompt followed by a dired buffer pointing at your home directory.  Example syntax to connect to your server from within Emacs:

<code>C-x d /cygssh:myuser@servername:/home/myuser/</code>
