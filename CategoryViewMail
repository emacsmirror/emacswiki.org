'''ViewMail''' (VM) is a mail reader that runs on GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

'''As of April 2021, the last update was May 2010.'''

VM comes with XEmacs but not GNU Emacs.

VM is very well documented. It comes with a fine set of info pages, and there are two EmacsNewsgroups dealing with VM. These pages attempt to distill some of the useful information from the other sources.
