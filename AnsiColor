<code>ansi-color.el</code> translates ANSI SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) escape sequences like "Esc [ 30 m" into EmacsOverlays, TextProperties, or XEmacsExtents with face colours, bold, etc.

These escape sequences are best known as "ANSI" which is where they were first standardized.  They can be found in ECMA-48 (section 3.8.117, identical to ISO/IEC 6429), freely available as a PDF file.

The "Graphic Rendition Combination Mode (GRCM)" implemented by <code>ansi-color.el</code>
is "cumulative mode" as defined in section 7.2.8.  Cumulative mode
means that whenever possible, SGR control sequences are combined
(ie. blue and bold).

'''ansi-color.el is part of Emacs!'''

To install it, put the following into your InitFile:

    (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)

And In order for this to have any effect, `ansi-color-process-output' must
be in `comint-output-filter-functions'. If not, use the following line to add it.

    (add-to-list 'comint-output-filter-functions 'ansi-color-process-output)

Some GNU/Linux distributions allow you to install a "color gcc" -- the warnings and errors are colored using escape sequences.  These usually display as garbage within Emacs.  The above code fixes this as well.

== Old Versions ==

You can also get a copy of ansi-color.el from this wiki.

* Lisp:ansi-color.el

If you're using an old Emacs, you might have to install ansi-color.el on
your LoadPath and add the following to your InitFile:

    (autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on "ansi-color" nil t)

== Eshell ==

If you want to use it with [[Eshell]], try the following to remove escape sequences
from the output:

 (add-hook 'eshell-preoutput-filter-functions
           'ansi-color-filter-apply)

The following will add colors, but its very slow.  Don't try it on /dev or similar huge directories:

 (add-hook 'eshell-preoutput-filter-functions
           'ansi-color-apply)

== term ==

`M-x term' and `M-x ansi-term' do their own hilighting.
It makes no sense to add ansi-color to these modes.
If you still want to investigate this, take a look at
term-emulate-terminal.  That is the function where you
would have to add your stuff.
