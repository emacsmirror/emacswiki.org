*repo-grep* runs a recursive grep through the folder structure of your Git repository, SVN working copy, or plain folder. It uses the symbol under the cursor as the default search term, which you can edit interactively. The search term can include a regular expression, and you can configure regex patterns as a prefix or suffix to further refine the search.

*repo-grep-multi* extends this to a recursive grep across multiple repositories or folders located in the same parent directory.
