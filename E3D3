I'm E3D3, alias [::e3d3], and use Emacs mostly for hobby programming, notes & OS-tasks.

I love Org-mode for literal programming, generating crazy config files, note taking and more.
My Emacs config keeps growing and often changes daily. It survived multiple bankruptcy's, that I often consider as welcome holidays with "new" rebirth. Elisp is still not my thing but learning a bit Common Lisp made it much more fun. - Update 2024: this changed; Now I'm often elisp its thing & even enjoy it most of the time.

My favorite external packages are [[http://github.com/larstvei/try try]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra hydra]] and [[http://github.com/areina/helm-dash dash-docs]], and ca. 50 more (in 2024).

What I still don't like (to say it nice) in Emacs are the theme's. None is good enough for both GUI & terminal, that is; all hides one or more elements by giving it the same color as the background !!! Crazy !!! - Update 2024: I didn't and won't try Prot's or other new theme's, so sick am I of waisting time on endless color lists.

Some of the things I shared here can be find on:
* [OrgSpeedKeys Org speed keys]
* [[smarterNavigatingBufferLimits]] (alternatives for `beginning-of-buffer' and `end-of-buffer')
