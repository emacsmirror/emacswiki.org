I'm E3D3, alias e3d3, and use Emacs mostly for hobby programming, notes & OS-tasks.

I love Org-mode for literal programming, generating Emacs & OS config files, note taking and more.
My Emacs config keeps growing & changing but survived some bankruptcy's. elisp is still not my thing but learning a bit Common Lisp made it much more fun.

Some of my favorite packages are [[http://github.com/larstvei/try try]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra hydra]] and [[http://github.com/areina/helm-dash dash-docs]].

What I still don't like in Emacs are the theme's. None seems to work in both GUI & terminal, and many even hide elements by giving it the same color as the background !!!
