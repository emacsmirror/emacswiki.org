You can upload an image to a page, replacing the text on that page.  A page can contain only text or an image.  You can inline these images on other pages, of course.

Alternatively, just use sites such as [http://www.flickr.com Flickr] to store your images.

== Standalone Images ===

Here are the steps to create an image and link to it. The image appears on a Web page by itself.

# Edit a page that you want to link to the image page.
# Create a link to a page named after the image by typing its name, eg. ''Here is a screenshot: !MyScreenShotPage''
# Click '''Save''' to render the page.  A question-mark link will appear after the image-page name in the preview: ''Here is a screenshot: !MyScreenShotPage'''?'''''
# Open the question-mark link in another browser window.
# Click on _Replace this text with a file_ at the bottom of the page.  (!MyScreenShotPage, in this example.)
# Click '''Browse''' and choose the image file you want to upload to the Web page.
# Click '''Save''' to upload the image and save it on the new page.

NOTE: Avoid Internet Explorer for the uploading (see EmacsWikiProblems).

== Inline Images ===

Here are the steps to make an image appear ''in line'', together with text and other images on the same Web page.

# Follow the steps above, placing a link to the image page where you want the image to appear in line.
# Change the link to this form: ''<nowiki>[[image:MyScreenShotPage]]</nowiki>''.

The image page still exists, but the link to it ''does not appear''. Instead, the image is displayed in place of the link.

== Limits on the Number of Inlined Images ==

Note that this wiki is protected by a SurgeProtector: You are only allowed 10 hits in 20 seconds.  If you inline images stored on wiki pages, then every image counts as another hit.  Assume a visitor does nothing for 20 seconds, and then visits a page with 10 inlined images.  With the 10 hits allowed in 20 seconds, you will be able to load the page itself, and 9 inlined images.  The last image will not load.  You can try it yourself by reloading this page more than 10 times: You'll get an error: '''Too many connections from xxx'''!

== External Images ==

The limit on inlined images does not apply if you inline images from ''external sources'' using an ordinary URL.

Example:

    http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/oddmuse-logo.png

Result:

http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/oddmuse-logo.png

=== imgur.com hosted images ===
An ''ordinary URL'' is not defined explicitly, but it would appear to require an image-type suffix (eg. <code>.jpg .png .gif</code> etc.)

http://imgur.com is a decent, easy-to-use host that does not require an account (unlike Flickr), but their images are not inlined by default: <code>http://imgur.com/K2UweJp</code>

::: http://imgur.com/K2UweJp

Unless you grab the special URL <code>http://i.imgur.com/mEfHEIZ.png</code>

::: http://i.imgur.com/mEfHEIZ.png


=== Ending a page with an External Image ===
Don't, and probably can't. 

One of the BannedRegexps prohibits pages from ending with URLS, so an ending url-image will fire off the ban-hammer.
You will see this in action if you hit preview.
If the page can't be rendered, backup, and edit the page so that ''something else'' (non-whitespace) comes after the url.
