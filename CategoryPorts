Click on the title to list all pages related to porting to other operating systems.

For various other platforms where compilation is required, see CategoryBuilding.
Here are the pages for platforms / distributions with binary packages:

* GnuEmacs source code for Unix and Windows NT.
* EmacsImplementations -- A list of Emacs clones and implementations.
* EmacsForDebian -- peculiarities of Emacs on Debian systems
* EmacsForGentoo
* EmacsForWindows -- also known as NT Emacs
* EmacsForDOS -- also works on Windows
* EmacsForWinCE
* For other Windows ports, see CategoryWThirtyTwo (W32).
* GtkXEmacs
* EmacsForOSTwo -- (OS/2)
* EmacsForMacOS
* EmacsForGuardianOSS -- AKA Tandem or NSK
* EmacsForZaurus -- compiles natively with pdaxrom
* EmacsOnFreerunner
* EmacsOnAndroid -- run Emacs on your google phone
* MaemoEmacs -- Emacs on Nokia N800, N810, N900

How well alternate versions of
emacs match the capabilities of Emacs and XEmacs is documented
in ComparativeEmacsology.

Here are some pages for those interested in building Emacs.

* EmacsDirectories

And here are some pages relevant for people using Emacs in a non-Unix
environment.  Mostly these pages add EmacsLisp-only replacement for common
unix tools:

* WoMan -- the man program
* EmacsShell -- a shell
* [[Sorting]] -- Replacing the unix `sort' command, and beyond.
* TarMode -- Operate on existing tar files.

(Some people may find the NT EmacsFaq a good [http://defensetax.com/ resource] for non-Unix
environments.  See OnlineResources.)
