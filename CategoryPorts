in ComparativeEmacsology.

Here are some pages for those interested in building Emacs.

* EmacsDirectories

And here are some pages relevant for people using Emacs in a non-Unix
environment.  Mostly these pages add EmacsLisp-only replacement for common
unix tools:

* WoMan -- the man program
* EmacsShell -- a shell
* [[Sorting]] -- Replacing the unix `sort' command, and beyond.
* TarMode -- Operate on existing tar files.

(Some people may find the NT EmacsFaq a good resource for non-Unix
environments.  See OnlineResources.)
