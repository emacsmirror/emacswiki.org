** LineCopyChar -- Copy character(s) from the line before or after to the current line.
** Lisp:savekill.el -- Save kill-ring immediately and restore to protect from emacs crash.
** Motion/kill do-what-I-mean -- [[cursor]] movement and [[kill|killing]] [[DWIM]] functions.  Lisp:motion-and-kill-dwim.el
** MousePlus -- highlight the [[yank]] position while you press `mouse-2', so you hit the right spot
** RectangleCommands --  commands that operate across lines in a region in a column-intelligent manner.
** Lisp:view-kill.el -- Displays the entire kill ring as a single page menu of numbered items.
** WholeLineOrRegion -- operate on current [[line]] if [[region]] is undefined
** ZapToChar -- Delete the characters from [[point]] to a character you specify.
** KillMatchingLines -- The power of ‘M-x flush-lines’ with killing.
** [[Anything]] -- `M-x anything-show-kill-ring' narrows the kill-ring by multiple patterns.

** duplicate-previous/next-line lets you replace current line with a neighboring one by cycling through them like you can with history in Bash. I bind them to M-n and M-p.  Lisp:duplicate-line.el
