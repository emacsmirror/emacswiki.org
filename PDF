Portable Document Format (PDF) is a digital document format under the ISO 32000 standard. A PDF can contain all possible elements to render a page or several pages, independently of the software or harware used to process it. 

== Reading ==
* DocViewMode -- Library included in Emacs. Converts document pages into images asynchronously to show them. It is costly and requiers other programs (such as Ghostscript and pdftotext).
* [[PDFTools]] -- Available in [[MELPA]]. A replacemente of DocView for PDF files. Uses a server to render pages on-demand and stored in memory.

=== Annotations ===
* [org-noter https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter]  -- Available in [[MELPA]]. Save notes in an external Org files while reading PDF documents.
** [https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools org-noter-pdf-tools] -- Integrate org-noter with org-pdftools.

== Writing ==
Using Emacs to write PDF directly is not a convenient option. It is preferable to write the contents in another format, and then convert it to PDF with a program or a compiler.

The following are viable options to create a PDF document.

=== Org exporters ===
A way to create a PDF document is to write it in OrgMode and export with the ##M-x org-export-dispatch##. Org documents uses an easy syntax and it is fully supported by Emacs. 

* ox-latex -- Included in Emacs by default. LaTeX and PDF exporter enabled by default (use the org-export-dispatch <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd>). Requires the Texlive (LaTeX) suite installed on your system.
* ox-beamer -- Export Org files to Beamer presentations in PDF.
: By default, uses level 1 and 2 headers as section and subsection, level 3 headers are new frames, and level 4 are considered as blocks.
* ox-pandoc -- Export Org files to several formats, including PDF. In this case, it uses the Pandoc program.

=== Markdown ===
Writing a document using MarkdownMode, and then converting it to PDF with Pandoc is another possible way. 

== Managing PDF documents ==

* [https://codeberg.org/kutuptiyini/elisp bibliothek] -- Managing a digital PDF library.

== Org mode support ==
* org-inline-pdf -- Previewing PDF files.
* [https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools org-pdftools] -- Support links in Org mode for PDFView.

== Converting ==
Tools and libraries to convert from or to PDF.

* UnPdf -- Convert PDF files to plain text.

== Interoperability ==
* LaTeX is one of the most used languages to create PDF documents, presentations, and books.
* Libreoffice can export to PDF files.
* Pandoc can also convert several formats (such as Markdown, plain text, and others) to PDF.
