My real name is Emanuele Tomasi and I'm from Lecce (Italy). I use Emacs on Slackware both for working and enjoyment. You can see my elisp packages on my [https://github.com/targzeta github page].

I love Emacs, EmacsWiki (but I think it's a little bugged) and [InternetRelayChat IRC] community.

A little screenshot (low quality but note [EmacsWiki:Smex#toc8 Smex] with acronyms, [EmacsWiki:LineNumbers#toc6 linum-mode] and the wombat theme): [[image:targzeta_screenshot]]
