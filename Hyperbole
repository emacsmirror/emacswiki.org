From its documentation:

: //GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Hi-per-bo-lee) is a mature, efficient, and programmable hypertextual information management and outliner system for GNU Emacs.//

Hyperbole is like Markdown for hypertext.  Hyperbole automatically
recognizes dozens of common patterns in any buffer regardless of mode
and can instantly activate them as hyperbuttons with a single key:
email addresses, URLs, grep -n outputs, programming backtraces,
sequences of Emacs keys, programming identifiers, Texinfo and Info
cross-references, Org links, Markdown links and on and on.  All you do
is load Hyperbole and then your text comes to life with no extra
effort or complex formatting.

Hyperbole interlinks all your working information within Emacs for
fast access and editing, not just within special modes.  Every button
is automatically assigned a type and new types can be developed for
your own buttons with simple function definitions.  You can create
your own buttons by simply dragging between two buffers.

But Hyperbole is also a hub controller for your information supplying
built-in capabilities of contact management/hierarchical record
lookup, legal-numbered outlines with hyperlinkable views and a unique
window and frame manager.  It is even Org-compatible so you can use
all of Org's capabilities together with Hyperbole.

Hyperbole is unique, powerful, extensively documented, and free.  Like
Emacs, Org, Counsel and Helm, Hyperbole has many different uses all
based around the theme of reducing cognitive load and improving your
everyday information management.  Then as you grow with it across
time, it helps you build new capabilities that continue to speed your
work.

GNU Hyperbole is available as a quick install package from GNU [[ELPA]]. The project home page is https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole. That page includes screenshots, download and installation instructions, and resource links.

A major new release of Hyperbole, version 7, the Git Ready for Action Release, was released on November 15, 2017.  It includes easily embeddable cross-references to git and Github objects, social media hashtag and user page links, rapid drags for displaying buffers and files in any desired window and window grids for displaying many buffers/files in a specified grid of windows, e.g. 3 rows by 5 columns.

Hyperbole's major capabilities include:

* Info Management: an interactive, unstructured textual information management interface
* HyControl: the fastest and easiest-to-use window and frame control
* HyRolo: a hierarchical contact manager with free-form records and fast retrieval
* KoutlineMode: advanced outliner with multi-level autonumbering
* Button Types: set of hyper-button types which supply core hypertext and other behaviors
* Programming Library: library classes for system developers who want to integrate with Hyperbole.

From [[RSW]], author of GNU Hyperbole:

People often ask us about the differences between Org mode and Hyperbole.  Although on the surface this comes up a lot, once you use both of these, you'll quickly see how different they are.  Hyperbole and Org mode can be used together, e.g. Hyperbole's Smart Keys work in Org mode, or separately; there is no need to choose.  Here is a contrast of the two, for those interested.

* Org-mode is a major-mode that works on structured files built atop Emacs outlining mode.
* Hyperbole is a system that spans across much of Emacs' functionality, providing quick access keys and hyperbuttons wherever needed.
\\
\\
* Org-mode's outliner is like Emacs outliner.
* Hyperbole's Koutliner is unique; every node/paragraph has a unique id and settable attributes plus a relative id that is auto-updated as you move trees around the outline, so you know that node 2b4 is a child of 2b and is the next sibling of the 2b3 node.
\\
\\
* Org-mode has explicit hyperlinks that you create and a limited form of implicit links (links recognized contextually from just the text of a file).
* Hyperbole has these too, allowing you to create them in any type of text file, with simple drags between windows.  But Hyperbole also recognizes hyperlinks embedded in many different types of files and buffers and can easily support new types.  You simply press one button and Hyperbole figures out what to do in dozens of contexts.
\\
\\
* Org-mode manages todos, time entries and some basic project management.
* Hyperbole does none of this but allows you to integrate with whatever other tools you like, including Org mode’s tools.
\\
\\
* Org-mode doesn't have any contact management builtin, only through add-on packages.
* Hyperbole has an integrated, fast, effective hierarchical contact manager.
\\
\\
* Org-mode does nothing with your buffers, windows and frames since it is just a major mode.
* Hyperbole has a fast, thoughtfully designed window and frame manager that lets you quickly arrange your Emacs artifacts as you like.  Eventually, these window and frame configurations will be saveable and will be able to be the target of links, so you can have quick access buttons that arrange things for different work tasks (similar to Workspaces but integrated with all of Hyperbole's other features).
\\
\\
* Org-mode does nothing for quick management of large, existing libraries of information.
* Hyperbole helps organize, link, search and retrieve libraries of any kind of text files.
\\
\\
* Hyperbole also has features that speed code browsing and structured code editing and support for using the mouse keys as Control and Meta modifiers so you can point and operate on screen entities quickly.

Q: I would like to see a comparison between the various Information Management tools and [[Hyperbole]].  Could anyone comment on this?

Q: Am I right if I assume that the major components of Hyperbole are something similar to outline minor mode + the ability to create links to different places (a position in a file for example)?
In that case I think that OrgMode can do the same things very good. And that already comes with Emacs 22.  New control of windowing, if as described, may be very exciting.  Exact position of windows and such.  As of the libraries of text files, I think I've used files of Org links for that, but never got them to "search and retrieve" as described.  I doubt the new incarnation of Hyperbole would replace Org, but if they merge as the above kind of predicts, this could be very useful.

A merger of Org, Hyperbole/Koutline, Muse, and Info modes would be perfect, sort of a „unified documentation project mode”, or a replacement for the very aged and limited Info system.
* afterthought: not necessarily a replacement of info, merely an additional, modern implementation which can directly interlink any relevant documentation (and completely casually can serve as a demonstration of the concepts and power of the system as a whole, showing off Org/Hyperbole in real action, with options to „Muse” docu into web-form or PDFs).
