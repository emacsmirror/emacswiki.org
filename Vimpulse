== History ==

Vimpulse prehistory started with [http://common-lisp.net/project/vial/darcs/extended-viper/ extended-viper], by Brad Beveridge. Alessandro Piras took extended-viper and enhanced it into a codebase called vimper, which isn't available online.

Vimpulse history began when Jason Spiro split vimper into two parts to make two projects: viper-in-more-modes 0.1 and Vimpulse 0.1.

Jason was maintainer of Vimpulse from 0.1 (May 2007) until he passed the maintainership on. Alessandro inherited the maintainership from him in June 2009.[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/39] Vegard Ã˜ye inherited it from Alessandro in April 2010.[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/309] In February 2011, Frank Fischer proposed to merge the Vimpulse and vim-mode projects.[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.vim-emulation/692] Frank's initiative culminated in a new project, Evil.[https://lists.ourproject.org/pipermail/implementations-list/2011-April/000756.html]
