One way to reduce repetitive-strain injury from Emacs is to avoid pressing two keys simultaneously with the same hand.  That is, avoid using [[modifier key]]s. For C-KEY, use one hand for KEY and the other for Ctrl.  For M-KEY, do similarly as for C-KEY, or press and release Esc and then press KEY.  And of course, take advantage of the automatic indenting and other features of Emacs that save keystrokes.

= OS-level =

== Microsoft Windows ==

On MS Windows it is the operating system that implements this feature for any application. It is in the Control Panel under Accessability Options and is called !StickyKeys, see [http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/stickykeys.aspx/ Accessibility Tutorials for Windows].

== OS X ==

Turning "Sticky Keys" on in the Macintosh is extremely easy (OSX 10.4.4). One goes to "Universal Access" in "System Preferences" and selects "Keyboard" in the horizontal menu across the top of the screen.  It is self-explanatory from there on. (Citing a message from John Gage on emacs-nxml-mode list.)


== Android ==

See [[StickyModifiersLinuxAndroid]].

== Linux ==

=== Console ===

For Linux console you can use ##loadkeys## from ##kbd## package to set Control, Alt and Shift keys to SCtrl, SAlt, SShift keycodes. See e.g. [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-15.html Keyboard and Console HOWTO:  15. Examples of use of loadkeys and xmodmap].

=== Desktop Environment ===

For wlroot-based and Sway, see [[StickyModifiersSway]].

For Gnome and KDE, see [[StickyModifiersLinuxDE]].

== Keyboard Configuration Daemons ==

See [[StickyModifiersKeyboardConfigDaemon]].  Some of them are cross-platform.

== APIs ==

The underlying API-level framework is called MSAA on MS Windows and ATK in GNOME. The applications have to use this to support Sticky Modifiers (and a lot of other accessiblity options). In some cases this is very simple due to the way the frameworks are built.

On MS Windows the support is simply built into the newer widgets so if you use those you get it for nothing

== Relation to Fitness and Health ==

Some people might find the comment at the end of AlexSchroeder home page useful.

[new]

I recommend trying out sticky keys if your OS supports it, because your hands really feels better. It takes a while to switch mindset e.g. from M-x to M x (pressing one after the other), but it's worth it. No less effective and less stress in the hands.

It seems that StickyModifiers conflict with [[Accelerate]].  -- XueFuqiao
