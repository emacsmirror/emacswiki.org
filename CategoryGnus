== Problem solving and debugging ==

The following functions and variables are useful for tracking down and debugging problems with your gnus setup:

|| function/variable            || Description                                                   ||
|| nnmail-split-history         || see where mail were split                                     ||
|| gnus-summary-respool-trace   || see where the respool algorithm would put the current article ||
|| gnus-summary-respool-article || respool the current article                                   ||
|| gnus-summary-respool-query   || Query where the respool algorithm would put this article.     ||
|| gnus-get-info                || show info for a specific group                                ||
|| gnus-set-info                || set info for a specific group                                 ||
|| gnus-newsrc-alist            || assoc list of read articles and group info                    ||
|| gnus-newsrc-hashtb           || hashtable of info stored in gnus-newsrc-alist                 || 


Group info is stored in the .newsrc.eld file (in the same location as <code>gnus-startup-file</code>),
and includes extra info not accesible via normal group parameter editing (<code>gnus-group-edit-group-method</code>).
You can alter group info using the <code>gnus-set-info</code> function, but to make sure the new settings are permanent
you may need to edit .newsrc.eld (after quitting gnus). For more info about .newsrc.eld and other startup files see
the manual: http://www.gnus.org/manual/gnus_7.html#Startup-Files

I use https://github.com/vapniks/org-dotemacs to store my gnus config code which makes tracking down errors easier.
