Jorgen Schaefer (aka. [::JorgenSchÃ¤fer]) is some happy emacs user with a homepage at
http://www.jorgenschaefer.de/ (formerly http://www.forcix.cx/ or http://old.jorgenschaefer.de/ ).  His nick on #emacs is [::forcer].

: Welcome, forcer. -- AlexSchroeder
:: Absolutely. (-: -- AndreasFuchs
::: hiya forcer! -- ShaeErisson
: Thanks all <nowiki>:)</nowiki> -- JorgenSchaefer
: forcer enjoys banning users from #emacs irc channel because of their nick names, for example a nick name 'zeppelinfeld' is such a name, bringing forcer's feelings into trouble where he has to do something about it, his solution is banning the user, now he has shown his power in the #emacs channel he does not have outside of this channel, it seems, he is happy. In short forcer can change his nick to 'nicktator', it would describe well his attitude. Modern, hidden 'hitler 2.0' type of personalities continue living in persons like 'forcer' in Germany, hiding is not easy, many actions show themselves. Burn others books, kill them, ban them. Because you are the master, hitler 2.0, welcome. Even reading others nick names in irc channels brings his true personality out. forcer, now you can come and delete this part, for deleting it from the history, you will find a way.

== Emacs Wishlist ==
Some things I have missed in Emacs, and don't see a way to implement
it easily.

* A minor mode that allows point to move past the end of a line without modifying the buffer. Going to the next line should always keep the current column.
* A `hl-column-mode' similar to `hl-line-mode'.

: Try Library Lisp:col-highlight.el . -- XueFuqiao

== Configuration ==
These are some configuration files I use. It's not all of my
configuration -- some of the Gnus stuff is missing -- but it's most of
it.

* JorgenSchaefersEmacsConfig (2007-07-27)
* JorgenSchaefersGnusConfig (2006-12-07)

JorgenSchaefersUpdateEmacswikiConfigfiles is the shell script I use to update these config files here. You will also need my [http://www.forcix.cx/software/wikiput.html wikiput utility] for this.

== Emacs Projects ==

* [[Circe]] - Yet Another Client for IRC in Emacs
* [[EMMS]] - The Emacs Multi Media System

* Lisp:bracketphobia.el - If you think that brackets in Lisp sources are a Bad Idea, this is for you
* Lisp:comint-scroll-to-bottom.el - Persuade comint-mode to keep the input line at the end of the window
* ErecMode - Trivial interface to sound recording and playback
* FlashCard - Flashcard learning program
* Lisp:golb.el - The way I generate my home page http://www.forcix.cx/
* LaterDo - Pseudo-concurrent "threading"
* Lisp:legalese.el - Add legal headers
* LuiMode - A line-oriented user-interface
* Lisp:mudel.el - Small but extensible MUD client
* [[Scheme48Mode]] - A major mode for improved Scheme48 interaction
* Lisp:srfi.el - Access SRFIs like from quack.el
* Lisp:tracking.el - Track buffer changes (application API)
* UnicodeHelperMode - Some quick functions to work with UnicodeData.txt
* Lisp:winpoint.el - Store point per-window, not per-buffer

=== Orphaned Projects ===
I don't use these things anymore, or they have found better
maintainers.

* AntMode - A very simple mode for ant files of http://www.ant-wars.net/
* Lisp:duck.el - All the stuff from quack.el that I actually use, slightly improved
* Lisp:emacs-wiki-finddead.el - Find dead files within an EmacsWikiMode wiki
* Lisp:idlehelp.el - Display configureable help when idle
* OutlineWikiMode - Outline-mode with file links
* VisibleMark - Make mark visible

I used to help with the EmacsIRCClient, but I switched to [[Circe]].

VcDarcs was originally written by me, but has found a better
maintainer since then.

What emacsen do you use? I use Emacs 21.4. I cannot find `with-selected-window' macro.
<code>(defalias 'with-selected-window 'save-selected-window)</code>
Is this workaround wrong?

[new]
Oh, this is GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1 (2006-06-03). A workaround might be

<pre>
(defmacro with-selected-window (win &rest body)
  `(let ((win ,win))
     (save-selected-window
       (select-window win t)
       (with-current-buffer (window-buffer win)
         ,@body))))
</pre>

The definition from subr.el:

<pre>
(defmacro with-selected-window (window &rest body)
  "Execute the forms in BODY with WINDOW as the selected window.
The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.

This macro saves and restores the current buffer, since otherwise
its normal operation could potentially make a different
buffer current.  It does not alter the buffer list ordering.

This macro saves and restores the selected window, as well as
the selected window in each frame.  If the previously selected
window of some frame is no longer live at the end of BODY, that
frame's selected window is left alone.  If the selected window is
no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
BODY remains selected.
See also `with-temp-buffer'."
  (declare (indent 1) (debug t))
  ;; Most of this code is a copy of save-selected-window.
  `(let ((save-selected-window-window (selected-window))
	 ;; It is necessary to save all of these, because calling
	 ;; select-window changes frame-selected-window for whatever
	 ;; frame that window is in.
	 (save-selected-window-alist
	  (mapcar (lambda (frame) (list frame (frame-selected-window frame)))
		  (frame-list))))
     (save-current-buffer
       (unwind-protect
	   (progn (select-window ,window 'norecord)
		  ,@body)
	 (dolist (elt save-selected-window-alist)
	   (and (frame-live-p (car elt))
		(window-live-p (cadr elt))
		(set-frame-selected-window (car elt) (cadr elt))))
	 (if (window-live-p save-selected-window-window)
	     (select-window save-selected-window-window 'norecord))))))
</pre>

Could you explain how did you produce the screenshot with the dvorak layout on top of your background image ?
And then, could you explain how to setup screen with Emacs C-a is taken by Emacs and I don't know what key to use instead of this one.

Thank you
[new]

The screenshot is simple. I added the dvorak layout using Gimp to my usual background image. The reason it can be seen is that I run Emacs in console mode - i.e. <code>emacs -nw</code> - and my terminal ([http://software.schmorp.de/#rxvt-unicode urxvt]) supports transparent backgrounds.
As for <code>C-a</code>, to the horror of some people on the EmacsChannel, I actually use <code>C-a</code> for both screen and ratpoison, resulting in me having to type <code>C-a a a</code> to get to the beginning of the line - or just the <code>Home</code> key. But for those who are not as crazy, you can tell screen to use for example <code>C-z</code> as the escape key using <code>screen -e ^Zz</code>. (I just couldn't find a better key than <code>C-a</code> for this...)

[new]
As for the Screen escape key: I've used <code>C-q</code> and liked it.  I've change recently to <code>`</code> (<code>escape `~</code>) and I'm liking it better so far. --EmilioLopes
[new]
As recommended in a .screenrc sample i use <code>C-p</code>. -- AnalphaBestie

[new]
 Thanks for the suggestion! I tried <code>C-q</code> for a bit, but for some reason it stressed my fingers more than <code>C-a</code>. <code>C-o</code> works nicely, but I used that for something else already (lengthy explanation). What keyboard layout do you use? --JorgenSchaefer

[new]
I also use the Dvorak layout but with some changes, e.g. unshifted parentheses.  I also implemented some of the tweaks from http://ratpoison.elektrubadur.se/Tweaks.  Nice tips there...
 --EmilioLopes

[new]
I'm using your mudel mode for my MUSH endeavours, and find it quite nice save for a thing: highlighting. I'd like to be able to add a list of words to highlight in either one or several colours, so that (for example) when a certain user speaks (or when someone whispers/pages) the line or the username stands out. I don't know how to really implement this, though... Is it supported already in mudel?
