Indirect buffers allow you to edit the same buffer in another buffer.
The most interesting thing, however, is that the indirect buffer can
have '''a different major mode'''.

This is great: If you want to write some elisp in a mail, start
writing the mail, create an indirect buffer, put it in
emacs-lisp-mode, write your lisp function, switch back to the original
mail, and send it.

A comment: if I do as suggested above, although I can turn on lisp mode in the cloned buffer (Emacs 21) and get indentation etc correct, font locking is still as in the original buffer. Why? -- MaDa

I have the opposite problem. Font locking works fine in the indirect buffer with the new mode, but when i go back, the rest of the base buffer is also colored according to the indirect major mode. Anyone with insights into the workings of font-lock-mode and indirect buffers/narrowing? -- [[Anonymous]]

The indirect buffer shares its text with the original buffer, including properties. -- PeterMielke

That's OK -- no problem.  Just toggle `font-lock-mode' in the base buffer (twice) to get back its font-locking.  You can have different [[major mode]]s in the buffers, and they can use different font-locking. -- DrewAdams


== Indirect Buffers that Clone and Narrow Other Buffers ==

Library NarrowIndirect provides simple commands to create an indirect buffer that is a clone of the current buffer and that is narrowed to a particular portion of it.  By default, it helps you distinguish such indirect buffers from non-indirect buffers, by using a buffer-name prefix (default '''`I-'''') and by using a different face for the buffer name in the [[mode line]].

 
= Emacs 21 and More Recent =

Emacs 21 provides functions to do this easily:

; <code>clone-indirect-buffer</code>: This creates an indirect buffer visiting the same file as the current buffer.
; <code>clone-buffer</code>: Use this for <nowiki>*Info*</nowiki> and <nowiki>*Help*</nowiki> buffers.  You
cannot clone buffers visiting files. You can clone buffers with inferior processes; anything which uses comint, such as *SQL*, *shell*, and *ssh* buffers. A new inferior process is spawned for the cloned buffer.

= Emacs 20 =

Here's the code to put in your ~/.emacs in order to get something like
<code>clone-indirect-buffer</code>.

    (defun indirect-buffer ()
      "Edit stuff in this buffer in an indirect buffer.
    The indirect buffer can have another major mode."
      (interactive)
      (let ((buffer-name (generate-new-buffer-name "*indirect*")))
        (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (current-buffer) buffer-name))))

Use `M-x indirect-buffer' to create an indirect buffer of the current buffer.



[:IndirectRegion]
== Indirect Region Extension to Vanilla Emacs ==
And this is what I use now regularly for reading book material containing
sourcecode examples. 

    (defvar indirect-mode-name nil
      "Mode to set for indirect buffers.")
    (make-variable-buffer-local 'indirect-mode-name)

    (defun indirect-region (start end)
      "Edit the current region in another buffer.
    If the buffer-local variable `indirect-mode-name' is not set, prompt
    for mode name to choose for the indirect buffer interactively.
    Otherwise, use the value of said variable as argument to a funcall."
      (interactive "r")
      (let ((buffer-name (generate-new-buffer-name "*indirect*"))
            (mode
             (if (not indirect-mode-name)
                 (setq indirect-mode-name
                       (intern
                        (completing-read 
                         "Mode: "
                         (mapcar (lambda (e) 
                                   (list (symbol-name e)))
                                 (apropos-internal "-mode$" 'commandp))
                         nil t)))
               indirect-mode-name)))
        (pop-to-buffer (make-indirect-buffer (current-buffer) buffer-name))
        (funcall mode)
        (narrow-to-region start end)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer)))

It seems one can also set the mode from a fake <code>buffer-file-name</code> (using
<code>auto-mode-alist</code> in the usual way). At least with Emacs v20.  So a
fake-file-name of say "x.el" will result in emacs-lisp-mode.

     (with-current-buffer the-indirect-buffer
       (set 'buffer-file-name fake-file-name)
       (set-auto-mode) ; in files.el
       ; (set 'buffer-file-name nil) doesn't appear necessary.
       )
