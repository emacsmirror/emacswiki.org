http://www.verona.se, where may of my Emacs projects are detailed.


I've worked on some emacs stuff like:

* Javascript and Ebrowse support for Cedet, CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools
(Of course hand-held by the illustrious Mr EricLudlam)

* maven2 support for Cedet

* Java support for Cedet

* zen-mode.el, a facility to quickly change between fullscreen and windowed mode for emacs.

* a patch for windows.c such that windows can be tagged to not be deleted by delete-other-windows.
This is useful for ECB like windows layouts, implemented at the C level.

* a semanticdb backend for java, which moves the responsibility of handling completions
from jdee to semantic.

* Fixed buglets in various modes such as visual basic mode and wdired mode.

* A package called Lisp:fsdired.el for sorting files with dired.

* EmacsXembed, a patch for embedding gtk widgets in emacs windows!

* A patch for Emacs so ImageMagick can be used to load image files.
I use it load .djvu files. It is now in Emacs 24.

* dired-sequence.el, dired functions to handle sequentialy named files.

* A patch for emacs to call the libmagic library for file info(This seems to get rejected due to complexity)

* dragbox.el -- draw a bounding box interactively in an image, and have it ocr:d

* emsane.el -- An Emacs SANE frontend, SANE is the scanner interface for free operating systems.

* dna-debug.el -- debug your dna

* inkmacs.el -- emacs and inkscape integration

Most elisp projects are at https://github.com/jave


The xwidget patch is a branch in the Emacs repos.

I've used Emacs since '88, but I only realised the potential of emacs nirvana in '04 when I migrated nearly all
my applications to emacs, except multimedia. Slow learner I suppose. Recently I've even been interested in moving 
musical and graphical workflows to Emacs.

A TODO of some stuff I should fill in:

* BabelMode
* EmacsCsound
* EmacsMidi
* EmacsSvg
* EmacsMemoryDebugging
* EmacsOnFreerunner
* EmacsTables
