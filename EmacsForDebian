== Emacs and related packages in Debian GNU/Linux ==

One can obtain Debian and Ubuntu packages newer than those included in the official versions, as well as build from source: see details [[EmacsSnapshotAndDebian|here]].

=== Debian related Emacs libraries === 

One can find lots of Emacs-related Debian packages with [[http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages|its search engine]] or with your favorite [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool|APT]] package management tool.

* Debian Emacs documentation is in package `*emacs-common-non-dfsg*` if `C-h i' isn't working for you.

* Many ELPA packages can be installed using the debian package manager. Try running "apt search ^elpa-" in the terminal.

* Note that the old Debian package `emacs-goodies-el' is "now a metapackage that installs the elpa-* packages corresponding to some of the previously bundled add-ons".

=== Misc ===

* http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/devscripts-el.html.en "Debian Developer's emacs utilities"
* apt-cache.el
* AptMode -- easy running of Debian apt-related software from Emacs.
* TinyDebian -- the TinyTools contains also a package with some utilities for Debian users;
  especially controlling [http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ Debian BTS] via mail interface.
* :( AptUpgrade :(  (Link dead since 2008!)-- major mode for selecting packages to upgrade.

* Debian package `debian-el': Emacs helpers specific to Debian users.  Contains:

** AptSources - major mode for editing Debian sources.list files;
** apt-utils - interface to APT (Debian package management);
** debian-bug - an Emacs command to submit a bug report;
** deb-view - view contents of Debian package, similarly to tar-mode;
** gnus-BTS - provides buttons for bug numbers seen in Gnus messages.


* dpkg-dev-el
** debian-changelog-mode.el: a helper mode for Debian changelogs;
** debian-control-mode.el: a helper mode for debian/control files.

* dpkg

== Problems ==
Please remember: The [http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ debian bug tracker] is the prime place to report bugs in emacs packages.
Keeping this list current is much easier if you add these infos:
* The package affected: [w3m-el-snapshot|wget-el|...]
* Link to the bug report
* Release you found this problem in: [Lenny|Squeeze|...|Sid]
I propose to limit the listing here to releases [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#Release_history still] supported to avoid cruft.


=== Avoiding Issues with Site Wide Init Files === 

The init files of the external packages should not, by default (or through an option), be loaded at startup, unless the user (or the administrator) declares  (require 'external-packages-inits) or requires packages or their init files individually.

Most debian packages that contain add on el files that would be installed site wide actually already do this.

If a specific package installs itself site wide, and you later decide that this is not what you want, you can always remove the offending file from /etc/emacs/site-start.d/  This change is sancrosant, and a Debian package will not later reinstall this file. (If it does, please file an RC bug using reportbug with Severity: serious)
