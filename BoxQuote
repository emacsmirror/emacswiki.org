Package boxquote by Dave Pearson provides flexible fancy quoting for most use cases like this:

 ,----
 | The default style looks like this.
 `----

* With <code>M-x boxquote-yank</code> you can put a box around text in your kill-ring and insert it at point.
* <code>M-x boxquote-region</code> puts a box around the region you selected before.
* <code>M-x boxquote-buffer</code> quotes the entire buffer you are just visiting at point in a fancy box.
* <code>M-x boxquote-title</code> prompts you for a title and adds it at point to the box that is already there.

Package boxquote can be configured via Customize using <code>M-x customize-group RET boxquote RET</code>. It is hosted on GitHub:
