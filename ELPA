== ELPA  ==
ELPA is the *Emacs Lisp Package Archive*, written originally by TomTromey. It is included in GnuEmacs, starting with version 24.  ##package.el##  is the package manager library for ELPA.


//“Our goal is to make it simple to install, use, and upgrade Emacs Lisp packages.  We supply// ##package.el## //a simple package manager for Emacs, and a repository of pre-packed Emacs Lisp code.”//


##package.el## supports multiple ELPA repositories.  Sometimes "ELPA" is used to refer to an ELPA repository.


[::GnuELPA]
The [[http://elpa.gnu.org/ GNU ELPA]] repository contains FSF-sanctioned Emacs packages.  It is the default repository used by ##package.el##.

You can use other repositories. The following examples show how to access [[Marmalade]] and [[MELPA]] repositories, in addition to GNU ELPA.

Add this to your [[init file]]:

{{{
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))
}}}

Any combination of repositories is fine.  You should probably always include "gnu", which is for GNU ELPA, but it is not required.

Package archives may also be [[LocalElpaArchive|local to your machine]].

You can also add repositories one at a time:

{{{
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t) ; Org-mode's repository
}}}

You can also customize [[option]] `package-archives':

{{{
M-x customize-variable [RET] package-archives [RET]
}}}

You get a UI and then you can add the archives directly:

{{{
Hide Package Archives:
INS DEL Archive name: gnu
            URL or directory name: http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/
INS DEL Archive name: marmalade
            URL or directory name: http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/
INS
    State : SAVED and set.
   An alist of archives from which to fetch. Hide
   The default value points to the GNU Emacs package repository.
}}}

=== Contributing to GNU ELPA ===

Package authors may wish to contribute their packages to the GNU ELPA respository. The first step is to complete your FSF copyright assignment. Then visit the [[https://savannah.gnu.org/|Savannah GNU website]] and create an account. Once the account is created, you can request inclusion in the ##emacs## group. Once granted, clone the GNU ELPA repository as shown on [[https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs|this page]], using the instructions from section ##Member clone##. Be sure to read the ##README## file in the repository. You should now be able to push to the repo.


== How Packages work in Emacs 24 ==

[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics|The Elisp Manual describes how the package system is initialized]]:
: Whenever Emacs starts up, it automatically calls the function `package-initialize' to load installed packages. This is done after loading the init file and abbrev file (if any) and before running `after-init-hook' (see Startup Summary). Automatic package loading is disabled if the user option package-enable-at-startup is nil.

So packages are initialized //AFTER// the init.el is loaded.  This means you should //NOT// put package specific initialization into your init.el except in a few ways:

* customization variables for a package are fine, they can be set before a package has loaded
* auto-mode-alist changes can be made in a way that does not require the package to be loaded before they are setup:

{{{
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.gradle" . groovy-mode))
}}}

* mode specific customization of a package could go in a package hook which can be set before the package is loaded, for example:

{{{
    (add-hook 'groovy-mode-hook (lambda () (setq tab-width 4)))
}}} 

* key bindings can also be done in such a way to not cause init failure, even if the package is not loaded:

{{{
    (global-set-key
     "\M-?"
     (lambda ()
       (interactive)
       (call-interactively 'magit-status)))

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-'")     'shell-switcher-switch-buffer)
}}}
* some package specific initialization can be done with eval-after-load, see [[ELPA#eval-after-load|eval-after-load]]

* it could be easier just to move package-initialize to another point during startup so you can (require) ELPA packages;
this takes care of a lot of the described issues:
{{{
    ;; basic initialization, (require) non-ELPA packages, etc.
    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
    (package-initialize)
    ;; (require) your ELPA packages, configure them as normal
}}}

* if all these tricks don't work you can still postpone config until after the packages have been loaded like this:

{{{
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'cycbuf-init)
}}}

=== Using the `after-init-hook' for package config ===

Some people think that using //after-init-hook// seems like a last resort because it may force the load of the package you're referring to (thus slowing down Emacs). Others point out that moving your whole initialization to after ELPA is loaded makes things easier to use. 

You can do that by putting this in your init file:

{{{
(add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda () (load "<real init file>")))
}}}

and moving all your normal init to the ##<<real init file>>##.

[:eval-after-load]
=== Using `eval-after-load' for package config ===

Using `eval-after-load' is one way of achieving fine grained configuration per-package. It falls back gracefully if the package is not present. 

The following code is an example of customizing a hypothetical major mode called abcd-mode using eval-after-load:

{{{
    (eval-after-load "abcd-mode" ; <-- "abcd-mode", not 'abcd-mode
      '(progn
         (setq-default abcd-basic-offset 7) ; setting some option
         (add-to-list 'abcd-globals-list "console") ; appending to a list option
         (add-hook 'abcd-mode-hook 'prepare-some-abcd-soup) ; things to do for abcd mode buffers
         (define-key abcd-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'play-some-abcd-song) ; add some key binding for abcd mode
     ))
}}}

And here is an example for a hypothetical global minor mode called broccoli mode.

{{{
    (eval-after-load "broccoli-autoloads" ; <-- "broccoli-autoloads", not "broccoli"
      '(progn
         (if (require 'broccoli nil t)
             (progn
               (broccoli-mode 1) ; Turn on Broccoli global minor mode if broccoli-autoloads.el doesn't do it.
               (setq-default broccoli-how 'steamed) ; set some option.
               (add-to-list 'broccoli-additional-stuff 'salt) ; add to a list option.
               )
           (warn "broccoli is not found."))))
}}}

[:with-eval-after-load]
=== Using `with-eval-after-load' for package config ===

Starting in emacs 24.4, `with-eval-after-load' is simpler than `eval-after-load':

{{{
    (with-eval-after-load 'abcd-mode
       (setq-default abcd-basic-offset 7) ; setting some option
       (add-to-list 'abcd-globals-list "console") ; appending to a list option
       (add-hook 'abcd-mode-hook 'prepare-some-abcd-soup) ; things to do for abcd mode buffers
       (define-key abcd-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'play-some-abcd-song) ; add some key binding for abcd mode
     )
}}}


[new]
I (who?) didn't see anything here about actually using the program (what program?). After setting variable `package-archives' via the instructions above, refresh the repository via
`M-x package-refresh-contents'.

Then to install a program, for example `geiser', use:
 `M-x package-install RET geiser'.
(Note package ##geiser## requires the [[Marmalade]] repo.)

Another hint, if the installed package doesn't seem to work, is to confirm that the package is actually installed, using `package-list-packages'. Search for the package name. The reason I added this step was that I had used ##install## a few times before it actually was verified as installed, after which it worked. During each installation, I got a question about saving the contents to a local file, and I'm not sure what that was about. But in the end, I was able to get this running. [[Who?]]

=== ELPA policy ===

ELPA policy for Emacs 24 was discussed here: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/132634/focus=132640

== How packages work in Emacs 23 ==

You can make packages work in Emacs 23, you need to add something like this to your //init.el//:

{{{
(require 'package)
;; Any add to list for package-archives (to add marmalade or melpa) goes here
(add-to-list 'package-archives 
    '("marmalade" .
      "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
}}}

In order to use package.el in Emacs 23, the following package.el (link found on github) version is needed:
http://bit.ly/pkg-el23 (source of info:https://github.com/technomancy/package.el)

In case Emacs 23 shows this error at startup: //File error: Cannot load file, package//, a solution to this error message is to add the following code to the Emacs init file:

{{{
(when
    (load
     (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/package.el"))
}}}
(Idea is from http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs23_install_elpa.html)

== Other Repositories ==

AndrewHyatt has written an [http://code.google.com/p/elpa-on-appengine/ implementation of ELPA for AppEngine], written in Go.  It is not yet running publicly yet, as of April 2013.

The source code for [[Marmalade]] is available on
[[http://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade GitHub]]. It is a complete
EmacsLisp project, an [[Elnode]] webapp.
