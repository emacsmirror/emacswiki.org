== Getting Emacs from from git ==

After the release of Emacs 24.4, the [[Bazaar]] repository was converted to a Git repository.

The official git repository is available from Emacs's Savannah page. See [http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs this] page on Savannah for further instructions on how to clone or browse the repository.

To clone (download) Emacs:

<pre>
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>

You can also get Emacs speedily from git by ignoring a lot of Emacs history. This makes the download size much smaller:

<pre>
git clone --depth 1 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>

and if you just want a particular branch
<pre>
git ls-remote (to see a list of remote branches)
git clone --depth 1 --branch emacs-24.4 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
</pre>

Lars Ingebrigtsen has written a helpful post on [http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2014/11/13/welcome-new-emacs-developers/ compiling Emacs] for Debian and Ubuntu users.

== ELPA package sources ==

The GNU Elpa package repository is also maintained using Git.

You can clone (download) the repository with this command:

<pre>
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/elpa.git
</pre>

== Alternatives ==

A mirror of the old Bazaar repository (please check to see if this is now pegged to git) available at http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git and a mirror of that mirror at https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.
