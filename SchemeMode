The scheme.el package included with Emacs provides a major mode for editing [[Scheme]] files.  It can be used with the CmuScheme (cmuscheme.el) or ExScheme (xscheme.el) packages for interacting with inferior scheme processes.

See QuackPackage for extensions to SchemeMode.

See GuileIde on using SchemeMode and other tools for developing in [[Guile]].

== Usage ==

Start Scheme mode with ##M-x scheme-mode## or visiting a ##.scm## file. Emacs will attempt to open an inferior Scheme process (a REPL). Emacs will communicate with this process while you work.

* ##C-h m## will list keybindings for the current mode.
* ##C-c C-z## -- Switch to the REPL
* ##C-c C-l## -- Load a Scheme file
* ##C-c C-t## -- Trace procedure
* more :3
