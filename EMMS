[[ja:イーマックス_マルチメディア_システム]]
== Overview ==

EMMS is the Emacs Multi-Media System. It tries to be a clean and
small
application to play multimedia files from Emacs using external
players. Many of its ideas are derived from MpthreePlayer, but it
tries to be more general and cleaner. It is comparable to [[Bongo]].

http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/

== Quick start ==

The best way to get started with EMMS is to read the quick start
guide here:

http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/quickstart.html

For information on how to develop EMMS or submit patches to it,
please visit the [[EMMSDevelopment]] page.

== Various Notes ==

=== Caching of tags & Async reading ===

Caching has now been implemented, and this largely solves the
problem of slow metadata gathering. Do we still need an async
process
which spits out the data, so we can process it in a filter?

=== Missing ===

* '''emms-lang.el''' - [[i18n]] support
* '''emms-remote.el''' - Popup window/frame with widgets for the
main functions

** Maybe a popup window like CEDET's browser with the playlist would 
be also interesting. For the main functions I have global keys (previous, 
next, pause...) in four consecutive keys.

* Some more player files (xmms, xine)

(simple players like 'play' are trivial to implement with
emms-player-simple - info is in the manual)

** Have you thought of using mpg321's remote control capabilities
(LOAD <file>, PAUSE, JUMP [+-]<frames>, STOP, QUIT)?

*now implemented - see emms-player-mpg321-remote*

=== MOD, XM, S3M and similar ===

For those who like to play MOD, XM, S3M and similar files, here's a
way to do it using mikmod:

    (require 'emms-player-simple)
    (define-emms-simple-player mikmod '(file)
      (regexp-opt '(".669" ".AMF" ".DSM" ".FAR" ".GDM" ".IT" ".IMF"  
                    ".MED" ".MTM" ".OKT" ".S3M" ".STM" ".STX" ".ULT" 
                    ".APUN" ".XM" ".MOD" ".amf" ".dsm" ".far" ".gdm"                            
                    ".it" ".imf" ".mod" ".med" ".mtm" ".okt" ".s3m" 
                    ".stm" ".stx" ".ult" ".apun" ".xm" ".mod" ".MOD")
                    ) "mikmod" "-q" "-p" "1" "-X")
    (add-to-list 'emms-player-list 'emms-player-mikmod)

However, since I seem unable to pass multiple arguments to mikmod
correctly, you might need to enable these settings in ~/.mikmodrc:

    LOOP=no
    EXIT_AFTER=yes
    PM_MODULE=no
    PM_MULTI=no

-- MartinSchoenmakers

Just fixed: "mikmod" "-q" "-p" "1" "-X", at the end of definition

-- Aitherios

=== sbagen Binaural Beat files ==

    (define-emms-simple-player sbagen '(file) (emms-player-simple-regexp "sbg") "sbagen")

Binaural Beats are sound files that try to induce mental states by playing sine-waves with
phase differentials in ear phones.

The player definition is trivial, I just didnt occur to me previously that emacs can be a very nice 
integrated binaural beat experimentation environment!

=== Mix CD Creation ===

While this code won't burn a CD for you (any suggestions there?),
it will take your current EMMS playlist buffer and symlink those
tracks (in the order they are in your playlist buffer) to a given
directory. Please feel free to post improvements (but do note what
you change; I'm curious).

Note that you probably need to make some adjustments if you don't
use a fairly uniform naming scheme for your music files. You
definitely need to adjust at least one path in the code (just take
a look).

Here it is:

<pre>
(require 'emms-playlist-mode)
(require 'cl)

(defun emms-playlist-make-mix (dir)
  "Eases mix creation by doing the symlinking for me."
  (interactive "FWhere should I make the mix? ")
  (save-excursion
    (unless (progn (get-buffer-create emms-playlist-buffer)
                   (set-buffer emms-playlist-buffer)
                   (> (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)) 0))
      (error "There is no playlist"))
    (if (file-exists-p (if (string-match "/$" dir)
                           (replace-in-string dir "/$" "")
                         dir))
        (if (not (file-directory-p dir))
            (error "File %s exists and is not a directory" dir)
          (unless (y-or-n-p "Directory exists. Continue? ")
            (error "Not continuing")))
      (make-directory dir))
    (set-buffer emms-playlist-buffer)
    (emms-playlist-current-select-first)
    (let ((counter 1)
          (lines (count-lines (point-min) (point-max))))
      (unless (string-match "/$" dir)
        (setq dir (concat dir "/")))
      (while (<= counter lines)
        (let ((track (cdr (third (emms-playlist-current-selected-track))))
              (symlinkname (replace-in-string
                            (cdr (third
                                  (emms-playlist-current-selected-track)))
                            "/home/user/media/music/.*/[0-9][0-9]-"
                            (concat (if (< counter 10) "0")
                                    (number-to-string counter)
                                    "-"))))
          (make-symbolic-link track (concat dir symlinkname) t)
          (emms-playlist-current-select-next)
          (setq counter (1+ counter)))))))
</pre>

=== KDE Notifications ===

Use knotify to display the current song. Requires Emacs with dbus:

<pre>
(defun ts/showsong ()
  (emms-next-noerror)
  (set 'notifyid (dbus-call-method :session "org.kde.knotify" "/Notify" "org.kde.KNotify" "event" "emms_song" "emacs" '(:array (:variant nil)) "Currently Playing" (emms-show) '(:array :byte 0 :byte 0 :byte 0 :byte 0) '(:array) :int64 0))
  (run-at-time "5 sec" nil 'dbus-call-method :session "org.kde.knotify" "/Notify" "org.kde.KNotify" "closeNotification" :int32 notifyid)
  )

(setq emms-player-next-function 'ts/showsong)
</pre>
[new]
Don't know why above code doesn't work for me. Hence, I came with another simple (and maybe rude one ;)

<pre>
;;; A rude way to make use of KNotify.  Tested on Debian/Squeeze. --lgfang
(when (and window-system (executable-find "kdialog"))
  (setq emms-player-next-function
        (lambda ()
          (emms-next-noerror)
          (call-process "kdialog" nil nil nil "--title" "Emacs - EMMS"
                        "--passivepopup" (emms-show) "5"))))
</pre>

=== Freedesktop/D-Bus notification ===

Use D-Bus to communicate with the Freedesktop notification service, or the minibuffer if D-Bus is not running.

<pre>

	   (dbus-ping :session "org.freedesktop.Notifications"))
      (progn
	(setq notify-method 'notify-via-dbus-notifications)
	(require 'notifications))))
 ;; could use the message system otherwise
 (t (setq notify-method 'notify-via-message)))

(defun notify-via-notifications (title msg icon)
  "Send notification with TITLE, MSG via `D-Bus'."
  (notifications-notify
   :title title
   :body msg
   :app-icon icon
   :urgency 'low))

(defun notify-via-messages (title msg)
  "Send notification with TITLE, MSG to message."
  (message "APPOINTMENT: %s" msg))

(defun emms-notifications-dbus (track-name)
  "Share track name via `D-Bus'."
  (let ((icon "/usr/share/icons/gnome/24x24/categories/applications-multimedia.png"))
    (notify-via-notifications "EMMS is now playing:" track-name icon)))

(defun emms-notifications-message (track-name)
  "Share track name via Emacs minibuffer."
  (message "EMMS is now playing: %s" track-name))

(setq emms-player-next-function 'emms-notify-and-next)

(defun emms-notify-and-next ()
  "Send a notification of track and start next."
  (emms-next-noerror)
  (let ((track-name (emms-track-description (emms-playlist-current-selected-track))))
    (cond
     ((eq notify-method 'notify-via-dbus-notifications)

=== Youtube, Vk.com and read tags from the stream===
Inspired by /sachachua.com/blog/2008/09/emacs-w3m-open-pages-in-external-browsers/

github.com/snoopcatt/vksearch/blob/master/vksearch

github.com/renard/emms/blob/master/lisp/emms-stream-info.el

I'm not a programmer, can you help me refactor this piece of code?


1. Adding youtube link from w3m-buffer

<pre>

(defun w3m-open-link-or-image-in-chromium ()
  "Open the current link or image in Firefox."
  (interactive)
  (let ((url (or (w3m-anchor) (w3m-image))))
   (if (string-match "youtube" url)

	  (emms-playlist-insert-track track)))
 (browse-url-generic url))))

(define-key w3m-mode-map "z" 'w3m-open-link-or-image-in-chromium)

</pre>

2. Searching in youtube and displaying in w3m-buffer

<pre>
(defun emms-youtube-walk (node)
      (when (listp node)
	(let* ((title (car (nthcdr 2 (car (xml-get-children node 'title)))))

=== How about movies, and subtitles? ===

The home page says that EMMS supports playing movies too and I am
too lazy to find out how far that goes? For example, does it
support selecting of sub text files for mplayer or other players?
Some more detailed information about this would be nice. -- MaDa

[new] It supports movies, just define a new player than can play
the extensions you want. What it doesn't support, though, is
subtitles selection. If you have an idea about how to enable that,
we'd like to hear it :) Currently I just use a custom python script
that parses mplayer output and let me choose among the different
tracks embedded in a .MKV. But for video clips, EMMS just works. --
LucasBonnet

[new] I am not aware of .MKV files, so I will ignore you just said
that, for now. :) What I do know, however, is that sub text files
most of the times have the same base name as the movie file, and
ends in .srt or .sub. Yes, there are other variants too, with
"vobsub" files. EMMS should be able to make quite good guesses. I
have some example elisp at home that I can publish here later, that
makes such guesses. Many times, mplayer will guess the correct file
automatically though. -- MaDa

[new] Here is the code I promised. I use it to more easily play
movie files using mplayer in dired:

<pre>
(defvar dired-mplayer-program "c:/pgm/mplayer/mplayer.exe")

(defun dired-mplayer ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((file (expand-file-name (dired-get-filename)))
        ext files basename dir curr-file idx-file sub-file srt-file
command options)

=== Streaming radio? ===

Can I use this package to listen to streaming radio (as is
available from http://www.kfai.org for example)? -- JoeCorneli

: ''Yes!  Now you can!  It's in CVS.  I've been using it for a
while, and it works really well once you find a good station.  Just
do (require 'emms-streaming) followed by `M-x emms-streams' to
start it up. -- DanielBrockman''

:: At least of my Debian EMMS (version 1.3), the correct require is
(require 'emms-streams). -- LucaCapello

RichardRiley: 3 Nov 2009

Create or edit your emacs home directory file "emms-streams" and add/paste this in (editing appropriately) for BBC Radio streams around the world:-

=== How about AlsaPlayer? ===

AlsaPlayer is a generic command line (--interface text) music
player that can play back a large amount of file formats, including
CDDA (CD) audio playback and icecast/shoutcast streaming support.

The name AlsaPlayer might be confusing a bit today since it now
supports a whole bunch of different output systems. The old default
OSS audio interface is supported, as well as Esound, NAS (Network
Audio Server), Sparc and SGI audio outputs. The most interesting
new output is JACK.

: ''Yes! You can! Follow these two simple steps.

* Customize '''emms-player-list''' variable so that it looks like
<pre>
'(emms-player-list (quote (emms-player-alsaplayer)))
</pre>
in your '''custom-set-variables''' section of your .emacs file.

* Conveniently add the following line in your .emacs file
<pre>
(define-emms-simple-player alsaplayer '(file url) (regexp-opt
'(".ogg" ".mp3" ".wav" ".flac" ".pls" ".m3u" "http://"))
"alsaplayer" "--quiet" "--nosave" "\"--interface text\"")
</pre>

Note: alsaplayer's icecast/shoutcast streaming support is not (yet)
integrated with EMMS, but usable.

=== How about a CD player ? ===
Is emms-cd.el deprecated ?

See AlsaPlayer notes, above.

=== How about using the Apple Remote control? ===

=== How about scrobbling to libre.fm? ===
[new] Emms (from the main git repo) now has Libre.fm support for both scrobbling and streaming music, and will be included in the upcoming 4.0 release. Last.fm support has been removed.

=== How about MPD? ===

MPD or MusicPD is an audio player. It acts as a daemon that can be controlled with different user interfaces, all audio files must be on one directory.

I found this, but I'm unable to configure emacs correctly. I would like to know how to play all the supported files with mpd and I have all my audio files on a specific directory in my user /home.

http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/emms/emms/emms-mpd.el?revision=HEAD

Here is the site: http://musicpd.org

----

Bug:  For some reason, if the playlist in MPD is very long (i.e., for listening to songs on random, out of an entire music selection), it always displays as the playing song the song prior to the actual currently-playing song in the playlist.

Bug:  Also, using emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all (in ~/.emacs), even if the MPD cache is updated, calling this function either in a running emacs session or in a brand-new emacs session will fail to update the cache accordingly.

=== How about UADE? ===

UADE means Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator. It emulates part of the Amiga computer hardware (using code from the UAE Amiga emulator) for running the original players of tons of audio formats, most of these formats are of the mod type and composed using tools known as "trackers". Amiga computers were mainly used by the multimedia stuff (before the term was invented), largely known by its games and demoscene productions, meaning there are tons of music files.

Stuff like mikmod is usable for a few of formats, but it can't play lots of others from Amiga platforms and others.

Site is here: http://zakalwe.fi/uade/


=== emms-print-metadata binary ===
Is there somewhere a win32 binary for emms-print-metadata or
another way to get all my tags work?

[new]
I've uploaded w32 build of emms-print-metadata to [http://gashinsky.googlecode.com/files/emms-print-metadata.zip]. It is compiled with MinGW. --DiGash

=== Getting lyrics ===
I've written a few lines to get the lyrics to the song that emms is
currently playing.  
(Just the lyrics, it doesn't get the lyrics in the format that will
allow emms to display the lyrics synchronically.)
It's a bit rough, but it works for me, so I thought I'd post it.

Lisp:emms-get-lyrics.el (2007), [[http://github.com/talau/elisp/blob/master/emms-get-lyrics.el|emms-get-lyrics.el]] (2010)
(The original Lisp:emms-get-lyrics.el do not work for me, so I fixed
it, removing mode-map, and adding some features: debug mode;
variables for match/unmatch the lyric in the answer;
match and remove ads;
auto redirect to the correct lyric when the tag of audio file is wrong;
when the lyric is not found, prepare buffer if the user want to write it;
before try to find the lyric, check: required programs, and artist and title in the song. -- talau)


Jay

JohnSturdy has written a major mode for creating and editing lyric files; it connects directly to ogg123, and doesn't actually use EMMS, but might be useful alongside it.

LyricMode

=== Getting it to work on win32 ===
I've recently downloaded EMMS, mplayer for windows, and
vorbis-tools in cygwin, but i can't seem to get emms to work. 

The config i used is the following: 
<pre>
;;EMMS player (a music/video player for emacs)
(add-to-list 'load-path "D:/emacs/site-lisp/emms/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "C:/mplayer/")
(require 'emms)
(require 'emms-player-simple)
(require 'emms-source-file)
(require 'emms-source-playlist)
(setq emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpg321 
			 emms-player-ogg123 
			 emms-player-mplayer)
      emms-source-list '((emms-directory-tree "D:/My Music/")))
</pre>

Where C:/mplayer/mplayer.exe is where i downloaded the windows
version of myplayer.

When i enter emms-play-file D:/abc.mp3 (a small test file), it
returns symbol's value as variable is void: emms-player-mplayer
Thanks alot!

[new] You'll need to add
<pre>
(require 'emms-player-mplayer)
</pre>
as well.  --MichaelOlson

[new] Well, i added that, but now when i tried to play the file, it
gave me this error: Don't know how to play track: (*track* (type .
file) (name . "D:/abc.mp3"))

It is probably that i cannot figure out or find how to get
mpg321/mpg123 working on windows, i got cygwin and vorbis-tools in
it as per advice from MpthreePlayer page. Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks alot!

[new]You need to put the player executable
(mpg321/mplayer/whatever) in Emacs' exec-path list:

 (add-to-list 'exec-path "C:/mplayer/")

--LucasBonnet

=== Images in Playlist Buffer? ===

So on the EMMS website, there's a screenshot in which the playlist
buffer (not just the browser buffer) displays cover images! I've
tried googling around but haven't found the code that enables that
particular feature, but would really like to prettify the playlist
buffer some...basically, it would be cool to have the default
display mode, plus images.

Anyway...any response is much appreciated. And just think--then
this'll be on the internet and will come up in google searches the
first time around.

[new]This is part of emms-browser.el - when you add tracks from the
browser into the playlist, it automatically adds the images as
well.
If you want to use images without the browser, you'll need to write
your own code to insert the images into the buffer.

- Well, that's the thing! I always use emms-browser. When I add
tracks from the browser into the playlist, it does *not* insert an
image (whether inserting individual tracks, a whole album, or
everything by an artist). And I use a recent (a few days old) darcs
version (this didn't work on the Debian version either, back when I
used that). What might be causing this abnormal behavior?

[new]The playlist uses a different size image by default. Have a
look at the variable `emms-browser-covers'

[new]
By default, emms will insert cover_small.jpg into browser buffer and
 cover_med.jpg into playlist.  Therefore, you need to make sure there
 are such image files for each directory.

Here is the script I used to create such files from images:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Modified: Fang lungang 03/13/2010 21:55>
for afile in "$@"; do
    path=$(dirname "$afile")
    convert -resize 60x60 "$afile" "$path/cover_small.jpg"
    convert -resize 120x120 "$afile" "$path/cover_med.jpg"
    # large cover not used
done
</pre>

=== EMMS and WMA ===
For one reason or another I have a bunch of WMA files. However, EMMS does not read the tags.
Instead WMA tracks are just mixed together under Misc. EMMS will play back the tracks, however.
Does somebody know how to make EMMS handle WMA tags? 

== DVD's and CD's Using MPlayer Player? ==

Is this possible? Would I just point EMMS to the /mnt/cdrom
directory?

== Deleting Items From Cache Without Deleting Files ==

Since EMMS seems to cache everything (which, normally, is useful
since I like to use the Browser), is there a way to delete items
from the cache without deleting the files? For example, I might
move a file to a different location, eject a CD (if there's a way
to play CD's), or delete it from somewhere else--in which case,
when I try to remove it from the cache using "D" in browser-mode, I
get an error about the file not existing (and the item remains in
the cache), so I have to use "touch" to create new files for it to
delete. Any thoughts?

[new]
Run M-x emms-cache-sync and it will look through your cache for
files which have been updates or deleted.

== Playing files from Apache directory listing ==

I share my whole mp3-collection through a secret link (i.e. you need to know the exact link to access them) on my Apache server, and some of my friends does too. So I wanted an easy way to get EMMS to play all mp3 files found in such a directory listing. It was quite easy to do. Enjoy!

<pre>
(defun my-emms-play-apache-mp3-folder (folder-url)
  "Plays mp3 files found in Apache directory listing."
  (interactive "sURL to Apache directory listing: ")
  (let ((tmp-file "~/.my-emms-play-apache-mp3-folder-tmp"))
    (when (file-exists-p tmp-file)
      (delete-file tmp-file))
    (url-copy-file folder-url "~/.my-emms-play-apache-mp3-folder-tmp" t)
    (while (not (file-exists-p tmp-file))
      (sleep-for 0 500)
      (message "Looking for file..."))
    (message "Listing downloaded. Parsing...")
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents "~/.my-emms-play-apache-mp3-folder-tmp")
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (search-forward-regexp "a href=\"\\(.+\.mp3\\)\"" nil t)
        (emms-add-url (concat folder-url (match-string 1))))
      (message "Done."))))
</pre>

Usage: Copy the URL to a specific folder with mp3-files. Execute the command above and paste the URL. The URL needs to end in a slash, I was lazy and did not want to check for it in the code...

-- MaDa

== Keybindings ==

This code sets up the arrow keys to control the player:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e <up>") 'emms-start)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e <down>") 'emms-stop)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e <left>") 'emms-previous)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e <right>") 'emms-next)

If you have "multimedia keys" on your keyboard, you might want to do the following:

    (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioPlay>") 'emms-pause)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioStop>") 'emms-stop)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioPrev>") 'emms-previous)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioNext>") 'emms-next)

Or... Are you running Emms inside your emacs daemon? Have you ever wanted to set it as your
default, primary audio player? Have you ever wanted to switch to the next track (this 
one suc*s!) but you where in Firefox/OpenOffice/whatever ?

Well, then give a look to [[EmmsRemote]], in order to bind your Window-Manager keychain
to Emacs/Emms ;-)


== Calculating Total time of all tracks in emms playlist, below the point==
I just started out with lisp and there can be any better thing to hack on but emms!

<pre>
(defun my-emms-playlist-total-time-below-point ()
"Calculates the total time taken for all the tracks currently in playlist and below point"
(interactive)
(let ((move-forward t)
      (total-playlist-time 0))
  (save-excursion 		
    (while move-forward
      (setq total-playlist-time (+ total-playlist-time (or (emms-track-get (emms-playlist-track-at (point)) 'info-playing-time) 0)))
      (forward-line 1)
	(setq move-forward (next-single-property-change (point) 'emms-track))))
(setq total-hour-only (/ total-playlist-time 3600)
	total-minutes-only (/ (% total-playlist-time 3600) 60)
	total-seconds-only (% total-playlist-time 60))
(message "Total time is %dh:%dm:%ds" total-hour-only total-minutes-only total-seconds-only)))
</pre>

== Use with Anything ==
'''[[Anything]]''' is a candidate selection framework.

Lisp:anything-config.el has EMMS related sources, `anything-c-source-emms-streams' and `anything-c-source-emms-dired'.

== Discnumber and discsubtitle ==

The discnumber tag is supported by at least mp3 and ogg files, and most players understand it. Is there a special reason EMMS ignores it ? It kinda messes up my media library, since files are played by track number apparently and thus when playing an album with two disc, both first tracks are played, then both second tracks, etc.

[new]
I implemented support for discnumber, patch sent to emms-patches and viewable from here: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.emms.patches/691 .  No response yet.  -- ChristopheRhodes
