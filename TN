== TN ==
Gnu-emacs user.

I use Emacs from within Debian, Ubuntu, and Cygwin.

=== Using Emacs from within cygwin ===

<b>Problem:</b> aspell crashes with messages like:

    "^M.cset" could not be opened for reading or does not exist.lib/aspell/
    Aborted

Characteristic in this kind of error messages is the carry return character &quot;^M&quot;. Maybe, it is not even printed. Then the error messages often look like there is a file name missing. 

<b>Error description:</b> One cause of this error may be that the personal word list file or other configuration files of aspell in the user's home directory have DOS-line ends (CR-LF &quot;carry return&quot;+&quot;line feed&quot;).

The &quot;carry return&quot; is wrongly interpreted by aspell as configuration information. Often it is mistaken as a file name and the corresponding file can naturally not be found.

For example, this error occurs when you switch off the low-level CR-LF conversion of Cygwin. This may cause some trouble in finding the error since at a first glance it has nothing to do with emacs or aspell.

<b>Fix:</b> For each of the configuration files of aspell in your home directory (matching the file pattern .aspell*)

# load it into emacs
# change End-of-line style to unix by clicking onto &quot;(DOS)&quot; until it changes into &quot;:&quot;; This should mark the file as modified.
# save the file.

== auctex-preview: keep old preview visible when editing ==
I don't like it if auctex hides the old preview for a formula while I edit it.
With the following snippet (e.g., in .emacs) you can keep the old preview:
<pre>
(defadvice preview-inactive-string (around preview-show-old nil activate)
  "Show old preview when editing source code."
  (when (overlay-get ov 'preview-state)
    (let ((preview-icon (or (car-safe (overlay-get ov 'preview-image)) preview-icon)))

      )))

(defadvice preview-disabled-string (around preview-show-old nil activate)
  "Show old preview when editing source code."
  (when (overlay-get ov 'preview-state)
    (let ((preview-icon (or (overlay-get ov 'preview-old-image) preview-icon)))
      ad-do-it
      )))
</pre>

== auctex-preview: Scale preview images with respect to the buffer-local face size==
One can change the buffer local face size with the help of text-scale-increase and text-scale-decrease from text-scale-mode (key strokes C-x C-+ and C-x C--).
The following advice synchronizes the size of the preview images with the buffer local face size.
Usage:
Install the package by pasting the following advice into your .emacs file.
In an auctex-buffer with previews first adjust the font size with C-x C-+ or C-x C-- and then regenerate the previews with C-c C-p C-d.
<pre>
(require 'face-remap)
(defadvice preview-inherited-face-attribute (after preview-inherit-local-face nil activate)
  "Scale preview images with respect to buffer-local face"
  (when (eq attribute :height)
    (message "advice preview-inherit-face-attribute")

	  (scale-factor text-scale-mode-step))
      (when (< scale-amount 0)
	(setq scale-amount (- scale-amount))
	(setq scale-factor (/ 1.0 scale-factor)))
      (while (> scale-amount 0)

== Pasting images from ms-windows clipboard into cygwin-emacs ==
Images cannot directly be pasted from the clipboard in cygwin (only text is supported). Therefore, one needs some windows program to grab the image from the clipboard and save it to a file. This is done via wpython2.7 and the python imaging library (PIL).

== Using xpdf as viewer with forward and inverse search ==
xpdf exists in cygwin and in linux and can be configured for forward and inverse search using synctex.

One clumsy method is shown here that overcomes some problems such as that emacsclient cannot be started from the xpdf-mouse bindings because of the obscuring parenthesis.

Note however, that this is a fast hack!

Prerequisites: "xpdf", "synctex", "bash", "bc", and "pgrep" must be installed additionally to "emacs".

The ".xpdfrc"-file in the users home directory should contain the line:
<pre>
bind ctrl-mousePress1 any "run(xpdfsynctex edit %i %j %k)"
</pre>

There should be the executable shell script "xpdfsynctex" in the users command path:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/bash
LOG=xpdfsynctex.log

echo "Running $0" "$@" > ${LOG}

declare -A FIELDS 

INPUT="`zgrep Input:1: *.synctex.gz`"
INPUT="${INPUT/Input:1:/}"

tofields () {
for ((i=1; i <= ${#EDIT[@]}; i=i+1 )); do
    IFS=:
    tmp=(${EDIT[$i]})
    if [[ "${tmp[0]}" != "" ]]; then
	eval FIELDS["${tmp[0]}"]="${tmp[1]}"
 	echo "FIELDS[${tmp[0]}]=${tmp[1]}" >> ${LOG}
    fi
done;   
}

echo "INPUT=${INPUT}" >> ${LOG}

HEIGHT=842
echo "Assuming A4 with $HEIGHT pt (72dpi)." >> ${LOG}

if [[ "$1" == "edit" ]]; then

PAGE=$2
X=$3
Y_FROM_BOTTOM=$4
Y=`bc <<< "${HEIGHT}-${Y_FROM_BOTTOM}"`

echo "Position in dots from top left: X=$X, Y=$Y on page ${PAGE}." >> ${LOG};

IFS="
"
EDIT=(`synctex edit -o ${PAGE}:$X:$Y:${INPUT}`)

tofields

CMDLINE="emacsclient -a /usr/bin/emacs -e \"(find-file \\\"${INPUT}\\\")\" -e \"(goto-line ${FIELDS[Line]})\""

echo "Executing:${CMDLINE}"  >> ${LOG}

eval ${CMDLINE}  >> ${LOG}

elif [[ "$1" == "view" ]]; then

BASENAME=$2
LINE=$3
COLUMN=$4
EDIT=(`synctex view -i ${LINE}:${COLUMN}:${INPUT} -o ${BASENAME}.pdf`)

tofields

PAGE=${FIELDS[Page]}
XTL=${FIELDS[x]}
YTL=`bc <<< "${HEIGHT}-${FIELDS[y]}"`
XBR=`bc <<< "$XTL+${FIELDS[W]}"`
YBR=`bc <<< "$YTL-${FIELDS[H]}"`

CMDLINE="xpdf -remote xpdfServer${BASENAME} ${BASENAME}.pdf";

if ! pgrep -x -n ${CMDLINE}; then
    echo "Starting \"${CMDLINE}\"" >> ${LOG}
    eval ${CMDLINE} >> ${LOG} &
    sleep 1
else
    echo "Server \"${CMDLINE}\$ already running." >> ${LOG}
fi

CMDLINE="xpdf -remote xpdfServer${BASENAME} -exec \"gotoPage(${PAGE})\""
echo "Executing:${CMDLINE}" >> ${LOG}
eval ${CMDLINE} >> ${LOG}

CMDLINE="xpdf -remote xpdfServer${BASENAME} -exec \"setSelection(${PAGE},$XTL,$YTL,$XBR,$YBR)\""
echo "Executing:${CMDLINE}" >> ${LOG}
eval ${CMDLINE} >> ${LOG}

else
echo help # todo
fi
</pre>

In the users initialization there should be the lines:
<pre>

== Multiple languages in one buffer (e.g. flyspell in latex-document with \selectlanguage) ==
The following piece of code lightens the input of multilingual text. It switches the ispell-dictionary in dependence of the language at the current point position.
The points in the buffer where the language switches are recognized by predefined strings at the beginning of line (see variable swL-alist).

Paste the following into your .emacs.el file (or whereever your configuration is).
Adapt the variable swL-alist to your needs.
Currently, detecting between english and ngerman in babel-latex documents is configured.
Then open your document and start swL-mode by M-x swL-mode.
The dictionary to be used for flyspell or ispell is then recognized automagically in dependence of the point-position.
