[[ja:カテゴリ・プログラミング]]
'''Category Programming''' is about using Emacs in programming other languages than EmacsLisp. Click the heading to find pages that link to this page.  

Language-specific:

* AssemblyProgramming -- Programming with the assembler.
* CPlusPlus -- C++ specific programming.
* CProgrammingLanguage -- C specific programming.
* DProgrammingLanguage -- D specific programming.
* CategoryJavaScript -- (including JScript) also see FlashActionscript.
* [[JavaLanguage]] -- Java programming with Emacs.
* ErlangLanguage -- Erlang specific programming
* MozillaDevelopmentEnvironmentforEmacs -- support for Mozilla technologies in Emacs.
* MythrylLanguage -- Mythryl specific programming
* PerlLanguage -- Perl specific programming.
* PuppetProgramming -- Puppet specific programming.
* PythonProgrammingInEmacs -- About python programming features
* RubyLanguage -- Ruby specific programming.

Coding style:

* AutomaticFileHeaders -- automatic insertion and update of file headers for different types of file (C, shell, EmacsLisp, and so on). 
* CategoryIndentation
* CommentingCode
* DeletingTypedefs -- adapt your coding style and convert typedefs to plain structs

Code navigation and information:

* [[EAssist]] -- Offers rapid method/function navigation for C++, C, Java, Lisp...
* ElDoc -- Display the argument list of current function at point in the EchoArea
* Lisp:tooltip-help.el --- show help as tooltip
* WhichFuncMode -- Display the name of the current function at point in the ModeLine
* ToggleTest -- A language agnostic tool to create/navigate quickly between source (test subject) files and the corresponding test files (Category: TDD, productivity, navigation)
* [[Tree]] -- Multi-directory find, grep, tags generation

Development environments:

* CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools -- complete development environment
* EmacsBrowse -- simpler than ObjectOrientedBrowser, but comes with Emacs
* EmacsForDevStudioUsers-- will make your MSVC-using friend envious of your comfortable development environment
* [[eproject]] - project workspaces for emacs
* IdeSkel -- simple environment for svn/cvs projects, with embedded "speedbars"
* ObjectOrientedBrowser -- supports C++, Java, Python, and a few other languages
* ProjectBufferMode -- generic mode to handle projects
* For !JavaScript -- try [https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode js2-mode] and [http://ternjs.net/ Tern]
* For Perl5 -- try CPerlMode and [https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::PerlySense Devel::PerlySense]
* For OCaml -- try [https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg tuareg] and [https://github.com/MarcWeber/merlin Merlin]

File management:

* AutomaticFileHeaders -- automatic insertion and update of file headers for different types of file (C, shell, EmacsLisp, and so on). 
* [[Bookmark+]] -- Tag files and code fragments a la [[http://delicious.com|del.icio.us]], to organize into sets and facilitate/control access. Bookmark [[Dired]] states. Open Dired on predefined sets of files located anywhere.
* ChangeLog -- Log the changes to your source files.
* EmacsCodeBrowser -- provides views of directories and files that go one step beyond what SpeedBar does
* [https://github.com/mattkeller/mk-project/ mk-project] -- Quickly switch between projects and perform operations on a per-project basis
* ProjectSettings -- Configuration settings for an entire project (directory).
* ProjectWizard -- simple, customizable project wizard
* ProjmanMode -- move between different projects (directories) maintaining options and open buffers for each
* SimpleProjectManagment -- A simple project managment
* SpeedBar -- provides alternate views into individual source files
* SrSpeedbar -- Display speedbar in same frame, very handy!
* [http://github.com/myfreeweb/startproject StartProject] -- Start framework projects (Django, Rails, SproutCore, etc.)
* VersionControl -- Manage revisions to your source files.
