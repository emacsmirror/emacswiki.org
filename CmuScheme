The cmuscheme.el standard package provides support for interacting with various [[Scheme]] inferior processes, and is used in conjunction with SchemeMode.

The QuackPackage extends SchemeMode and CmuScheme.

See GuileIde for information on using CmuScheme and other tools with the [[Guile]] dialect of [[Scheme]].

See RunSchemeHere for an extension that allows you to run multiple inferior scheme processes .
