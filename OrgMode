[:using]
== Texts on using org-mode ==

David O'Toole has written a [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html general tutorial] with screenshots. It has been translated into [http://hokmen.chan.googlepages.com/OrgTutorial.en-cn.html Chinese], [http://web.archive.org/web/20080225214358/http://lumiere.ens.fr/~guerry/orgtutorialfr.html French], [http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~mpasztor/orgtutorial/notebook/orgtutorial-hu.html Hungarian], [http://hpcgi1.nifty.com/spen/index.cgi?OrgMode/OrgTutorial Japanese] and [http://jmjeong.com/index.php?display=Emacs/OrgMode Korean]. [http://orgmode.org/worg/ Worg] has many tutorials on specific features. Charles Cave has [http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/org_dates/index.html has written] on using date and times. Bernt Hansen describes his use and customizations of Org-mode in 70(!) pages long [http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html document], which assumes basic familiarity with Org.

One of the major influences in 2006/2007 on task organization has been the book [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done Getting Things Done] (GTD). Using Org-mode for GTD has been [http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html described] by Charles Cave and a modest example configuration has been given [http://www.brool.com/index.php/using-org-mode-with-gtd here].

Eric Neilsen has a [http://home.fnal.gov/~neilsen/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html cookbook of Org configuration snippets]. Bernt Hansen wrote about [http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html lots of things you can do with Org]. SachaChua has [http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/tips-learning-org-mode-emacs/ a graphical map for learning Org]. 

Somewhat dated (2007): Both [http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/ John Wiegley] and [http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/29/how-to-use-emacs-org-as-a-basic-day-planner/ Sacha Chua] have described day planner usage. Another piece by SachaChua is [http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/22/a-day-in-a-life-with-org/ "A day in the life with Org"].

[:publish]
== Publishing ==

You can *publish to HTML* using `C-c C-e h', or you can use BhlMode for LaTeX or HTML output. Just switch modes before exporting (`M-x bhl-mode'). BhlMode should automatically recognize the asterisks as marking sections and subsections. See EmacsOutlineToHtml for other alternatives.

[http://dto.mamalala.org/e/org-publish.el org-publish.el] (this comes in the latest version of org-mode) by DavidOtoole
  is a publishing management system for creating
  websites composed of all the files within a project (including
  OrgMode files, images, and source code, if desired).

=== new exporter/publish framework ===
* [http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/ox-overview.html The New Org-mode Exporter Framework] - ''As of release 8.0, Org-mode has transitioned to a new export framework, authored primarily (entirely?) by Nicolas Goaziou…''
* For instructions on how to upgrade from the previous Org-mode exporter, see the [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-8.0.html upgrade guide.]


[:conflicts]
== Conflicts ==

If you're using WindMove, CuaMode or MTorus (with default keybindings), you might want to disable the Org Mode keybindings for Shift+arrow keys:

    (setq org-replace-disputed-keys t)

(This need to be done before org.el is loaded, or requires a restart of Emacs to be effective.)

This will result in the following replacements:

*  S-RET   -> C-S-RET
*  S-up    -> M-p
*  S-down  -> M-n
*  S-left  -> M--
*  S-right -> M-+

If AllOut from Emacs 21 is loaded before org.el, you will be getting a ##Wrong type argument ((keymapp nil))## error. This was fixed in Emacs 22.

If you are forced to use Emacs 21, either install a newer version of allout.el, or make sure that org.el is loaded before allout.el.  For example, use ##(require 'org)## before requiring allout.

If you're using session.el (EmacsSession), you need to excempt a circular data structure from saving:

    (add-to-list 'session-globals-exclude 'org-mark-ring)

If you're using Emacs 23 and Org 7.5, then you can also have some pseudo-compatability while maintaining CUA support with Lisp:org-cua-dwim.el

[:datasources]
== External Data Sources ==

If you publish external sources to org mode agenda files, you'll need to refresh those files after changes occur.  Try this snippet to reload those files.

    (defun org-reload ()
      (interactive)
      (switch-to-buffer "mail.org")
      (revert-buffer nil 1)
      (org-agenda nil "a")
      (delete-other-windows))

=== Dragging URLs ===

This function uses org-mode support for plain list to facilitate dragging URLs from a webbrowser (or other apps) to an org-mode buffer:

<pre>
(defadvice dnd-insert-text (around org-mouse-dnd-insert-text activate)
  (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
      (progn
	(cond
	 ;; if this is the end of the line then just insert text here
	 ((eolp)
	  (skip-chars-backward " \t")
	  (kill-region (point) (point-at-eol))
	  (unless (looking-back ":") (insert ":"))
	  (insert " "))

	 ;; if this is the beginning of the line then insert before
	 ((and (looking-at " \\|\t")
	       (save-excursion
		 (skip-chars-backward " \t") (bolp)))
	  (beginning-of-line)
	  (looking-at "[ \t]*")
	  (open-line 1)
	  (indent-to (- (match-end 0) (match-beginning 0)))
	  (insert "+ "))

	 ;; if this is a middle of the line, then insert after
	 (t
	  (end-of-line)
	  (newline t)
	  (indent-relative)
	  (insert "+ ")))
	(insert text)
	(beginning-of-line))
    ad-do-it))
</pre>

=== Including all org files from a directory into the agenda ===

<pre>
(setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/org/*.org"))
</pre>

=== Turn header lines into apparent visible separators ===

To make header lines more apparently visible in the buffer, set them a background color and change this part of `org-set-font-lock-defaults', so that the header line is drawn across the screen:

<pre>
	   ;; Headlines
	   '("^\\(\\**\\)\\(\\* \\)\\(.*\xa\\)" (1 (org-get-level-face 1))
	     (2 (org-get-level-face 2)) (3 (org-get-level-face 3)))
</pre>

The only change is the `\xa' character is added before the last closing paren. This feature has been added to org-mode; see `org-fontify-whole-heading-line'.

=== Following Links ===

To follow links with RET, rather than a 2 key combo:

    (setq org-return-follows-link t)

You can also make TAB follow links in a similar way.

=== Opening pdf at specific page ===
To open links of type [~/test.pdf::3] i.e. open file at page 3:
<pre>
    (delete '("\\.pdf\\'" . default) org-file-apps)
    (add-to-list 'org-file-apps '("\\.pdf::\\([0-9]+\\)\\'" . "evince \"%s\" -p %1"))
</pre>

=== Opening pdf with alternative application ===
To open a link with a program other than the default(e.g. modify a pdf rather than read it):
<pre>
(defun my-org-open-at-point()
  (interactive)
  (let ((org-file-apps '(("\\.pdf\\'" . "xournal %s"))))
    (org-open-at-point)
    ))
</pre>

=== Sort a column in an Org Table ===

Org-Mode provide org-table-sort-lines ##C-c ^## to sort all  the table lines based on a column. But sometime one need to sort just one column :
<pre>

(defun org-table-sort-column ()
  "Sort table column at point."

  (interactive)
  (let* ((thisline (org-current-line))
	 (thiscol (org-table-current-column))
	 (otc org-table-overlay-coordinates)
	 beg end bcol ecol tend tbeg column lns pos)
    (when (equal thiscol 0)
      (if (org-called-interactively-p 'any)
	  (setq thiscol
		(string-to-number
		 (read-string "Use column N for sorting: ")))
	(setq thiscol 1))
      (org-table-goto-column thiscol))
    (org-table-check-inside-data-field)
    (if (org-region-active-p)
	(progn
	  (setq beg (region-beginning) end (region-end))
	  (goto-char beg)
	  (setq column (org-table-current-column)
		beg (point-at-bol))
	  (goto-char end)
	  (setq end (point-at-bol 2)))
      (setq column (org-table-current-column)
	    pos (point)
	    tbeg (org-table-begin)
	    tend (org-table-end))
      (if (re-search-backward org-table-hline-regexp tbeg t)
	  (setq beg (point-at-bol 2))
	(goto-char tbeg)
	(setq beg (point-at-bol 1)))
      (goto-char pos)
      (if (re-search-forward org-table-hline-regexp tend t)
	  (setq end (point-at-bol 1))
	(goto-char tend)
	(setq end (point-at-bol))))
    (setq beg (move-marker (make-marker) beg)
	  end (move-marker (make-marker) end))
    (untabify beg end)
    (goto-char beg)
    (org-table-goto-column column)
    (skip-chars-backward "^|")
    (setq bcol (point))
    (goto-char end)
    (previous-line)
    (org-table-goto-column column)
    (skip-chars-forward "^|")
    (setq ecol (point))
    (org-table-copy-region bcol ecol nil)
    (setq lns (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons 
				   (org-sort-remove-invisible 
				    (substring-no-properties x) )
				   x))
		      ( mapcar 'car org-table-clip)))    
    (setq lns (org-do-sort lns "Column" ))

    (setq org-table-clip (mapcar 'list (mapcar 'cdr lns)))
    (goto-char beg)
    (org-table-goto-column column)
    (org-table-paste-rectangle)
    (org-goto-line thisline)
    (org-table-goto-column thiscol)
    (when otc (org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays))
    (message "%d element sorted in column %d" (length lns) column)))

</pre>
=== Editing Wikipedia ===

Org Mode can be easily configured to help edit *Wikipedia* articles by changing outline-regexp in the mode hook:

<pre>
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook '(lambda () (setq outline-regexp "=+")))
</pre>

If you use WThreeM, add the following instead:
<pre>
(setq w3m-form-textarea-edit-mode 'org-mode)
(add-hook 'w3m-form-input-textarea-mode-hook
          '(lambda nil
                   (setq outline-regexp "=+")))
</pre>

=== Export UTF-8 checkboxes ===

This snippet turns <code>- [X]</code> into ☑ and <code>- [ ]</code> into ☐.

<pre>
(defun sacha/org-html-checkbox (checkbox)
  "Format CHECKBOX into HTML."
  (case checkbox (on "<span class=\"check\">&#x2611;</span>") ; checkbox (checked)
	(off "<span class=\"checkbox\">&#x2610;</span>")
	(trans "<code>[-]</code>")
	(t "")))
(defadvice org-html-checkbox (around sacha activate)
  (setq ad-return-value (sacha/org-html-checkbox (ad-get-arg 0))))
</pre>

===Refile to opened orgmode buffer===
The following codes allow refile to opened orgmode buffer files. (Currently set at level 1, to avoid too many refile targets when there are lots of orgmode files opened).

<pre>
(defun ixp/org-buffer-files ()
  "Return list of opened orgmode buffer files"
  (mapcar (function buffer-file-name)
	  (org-buffer-list 'files)))

(setq org-refile-targets
      (quote ((nil :maxlevel . 3)
	      (ixp/org-buffer-files :maxlevel . 1)
	      (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 3))))
</pre>

===Run org-todo at a specified date===
The following code snippet allows you to run <code>org-todo</code> as though it had been executed at some prior time that is interactively selected using <code>org-read-date</code>. This is particularly useful if you use the org-habits module and you are late to file the completion of a habit. If you complete the habit with org-todo it will be completed for the current day, and scheduled to repeat at the next repeat interval based on the current date. If you use <code>org-todo-at-date</code> and set the appropriate date, the task will be scheduled to repeat as though the task had been completed on the specified date.
<pre>
(defun org-todo-at-date (date)
  (interactive (list (org-time-string-to-time (org-read-date))))
  (flet ((org-current-effective-time (&rest r) date)
         (org-today (&rest r) (time-to-days date)))
    (org-todo)))
</pre>
