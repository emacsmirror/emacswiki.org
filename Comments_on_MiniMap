I like the sublimity package - it seems much less intrusive and doesn't show my ido-mode completions inside the minimap buffer.

I found minimap very helpful - thanks. 
However, It is not working with R scripts (ess-mode). It works well with Lisp, perl ... 

Any hint on how to fix that ? it will be much appreciated.
