Click on the page title to find all pages related to PersonalInformationManager (PIM) software for Emacs.

Various packages can be used to cover particular aspects of a
Personal Information Manager (PIM).

* BbdbMode (BBDB) does addresses, phone numbers, notes, mailing lists,
comments, communication history, scoring of mails in Gnus, printing of
address lists. See CategoryBbdb

* DiaryMode allow you to make appointments, plan ahead, remember
birthdays (these are not linked to entries in the BBDB), holidays.

* CalendarMode does transformation into other calendars, has islamic,
jewish, mayan and other calendars, prints weekly and monthly calendars
(using LaTeX and not including your appointments).

* RemembranceAgent watches over your shoulder and suggests information
relevant to what you're reading or writing.

* PlannerMode integrates the various modes out there (EmacsWikiMode,
BbdbMode, DiaryMode, Gnus, etc.)  and tries to provide a coherent,
wiki-based interface.

* OrgMode is a organizer based on OutlineMode.

* OrganizerMode generates and uses pages with linked information from
todo mode, bbdb, diary, gnus, vm, etc.. as well as a related organizer
file (similar to a todo file).  Provides commands to link entries to
their proper pages and access the proper pages from entries in their
native modes as distributed with emacs.  Organizer actions may be
performed on upon organizer page entries.  Note that OrganizerMode is not being
maintained anymore.

* RememberMode allows you to save the occasional snippet of information
here and there and organize it later.  It is little more than a key
combo that copies the region into a special notes buffer and saves it.

* RecordsMode provides an online journal and a todo list.

* CategorizingInformationManager collects information from different
sources and converts it into a database of related facts and displays
category trees in a view buffer.  It can be used as stand-alone PIM,
where information is stored in its own database files.  Also it can be
used as an "indexer" for other existing PIMs to provide the simple
interface to browse and operate on their data (e.g. it already
provides an extension for BbdbMode to organize its data in a tree
outlines).

* HowmMode allows you to take notes fragmentarily and browse them collectively.

* EmacsPilot allows synchronization of the BBDB database and the Emacs diary with 
any PDA supported by pilot-link.

* AddressBook is a vCard based contacts manager (similar to bbdb). It is still in development.

* EmacsDataBase is a flexible system for defining, accessing, modifying,
summarizing, and generally playing with, a set of records.  You can view each
record individually or summarized (with other records) in separate buffer.
Record format (field names and their types) can be arbitrarily complex.

* [[Synonyms]] lets you search and browse comma-separated values (CSV) file as a hyperlinked "thesaurus". This could as well be a list of contacts or any other CSV data. For example, export your Outlook (or Fire Fox) Contacts as a CSV file, then use Emacs to browse and search them.

* ExtendedPageHandling provides an early and primitive system to sort, search and navigate records separated by PageBreaks.
