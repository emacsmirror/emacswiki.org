Click on the page title to find all pages related to PersonalInformationManager (PIM) software for Emacs.

Various packages can be used to cover particular aspects of a
Personal Information Manager (PIM).

* AddressBook is a vCard based contacts manager (similar to bbdb). It is still in development.

* BbdbMode (BBDB) does addresses, phone numbers, notes, mailing lists,
comments, communication history, scoring of mails in Gnus, printing of
address lists. See CategoryBbdb

* CalendarMode does transformation into other calendars, has islamic,
jewish, mayan and other calendars, prints weekly and monthly calendars
(using LaTeX and not including your appointments).

* CategorizingInformationManager collects information from different
sources and converts it into a database of related facts and displays
category trees in a view buffer.  It can be used as stand-alone PIM,
where information is stored in its own database files.  Also it can be
used as an "indexer" for other existing PIMs to provide the simple
interface to browse and operate on their data (e.g. it already
provides an extension for BbdbMode to organize its data in a tree
outlines).

* DiaryMode allow you to make appointments, plan ahead, remember
birthdays (these are not linked to entries in the BBDB), holidays.

* EmacsDataBase is a flexible system for defining, accessing, modifying,
summarizing, and generally playing with, a set of records.  You can view each
record individually or summarized (with other records) in separate buffer.
Record format (field names and their types) can be arbitrarily complex.

* EmacsPilot allows synchronization of the BBDB database and the Emacs diary with 
any PDA supported by pilot-link.

* ExtendedPageHandling provides an early and primitive system to sort, search
  and navigate records separated by PageBreaks.

* HowmMode allows you to take notes fragmentarily and browse them collectively.

* [[Hyperbole]], the Everyday Hypertextual Information Manager, is a set of tools with easy-to-navigate keyboard and menubar menus that lets you hyperlink your world without learning a markup language, lets you precisely and quickly control your windows and frames, lets you quickly look up contacts in hierarchical categories (including basic BBDB integration) and comes with an extensive manual.

* [[LinkdMode|LinkD]] lets you create links within and among Emacs buffers and files.

* OrganizerMode generates and uses pages with linked information from
todo mode, bbdb, diary, gnus, vm, etc.. as well as a related organizer
file (similar to a todo file).  Provides commands to link entries to
their proper pages and access the proper pages from entries in their
native modes as distributed with emacs.  Organizer actions may be
performed on upon organizer page entries.  Note that OrganizerMode is not being
maintained anymore.

* OrgMode is a organizer based on OutlineMode.

* PlannerMode integrates the various modes out there (EmacsWikiMode,
BbdbMode, DiaryMode, Gnus, etc.)  and tries to provide a coherent,
wiki-based interface.

* RecordsMode provides an online journal and a todo list.

* RememberMode allows you to save the occasional snippet of information
here and there and organize it later.  It is little more than a key
combo that copies the region into a special notes buffer and saves it.

* RemembranceAgent watches over your shoulder and suggests information
relevant to what you're reading or writing.

* [[Synonyms]] lets you search and browse comma-separated values (CSV) file as a
  hyperlinked "thesaurus". This could as well be a list of contacts or any other
  CSV data. For example, export your Outlook (or Fire Fox) Contacts as a CSV
  file, then use Emacs to browse and search them.
