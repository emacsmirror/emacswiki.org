This page tries to help people be better writers on this wiki. It belongs to the HowToEdit group of pages.

Be *short*. Long pages make things hard to find.

Use *headers*. A table of contents will be created for every page containing several headers.

Use *bold* (##*bold*##) to make text easy to skim.

If things are important for *older versions*, clearly separate them from the main body
of the page using headers.

*Delete* stuff that is no longer relevant.

Avoid *discussion* of stuff that's outdated or wrong. Just rewrite it to be up to date and correct.
If there is a discussion, take it to the talk pages (follow the _Talk_ link at the bottom) or make the discussion obvious to future readers by using a header ("Discussion") and separating contributions using ##[new]##.

Write *as if you are talking to someone*.

You can ask people on the EmacsChannel to *peer review* your contribution.

When saving a page, please make sure you add a *summary*. Just copy and paste a sentences from the text you wrote or mention a keyword or two. It helps others that are following along on RecentChanges.

Does a newbie need any more bulletpoints than necessary? Let's reformat this into more prose and less bullet points, to make this more coherent and less jarring. -- StudentRadical

I don't know how prose is always better than lists.  Itemized lists are pretty simple and good for navigation on the Web (and in [[Info]]!) and easier to maintain and likely translate.

The issue is more of the Wiki practice of referencing every page in a category, of which EmacsNewbie is one, rather than having a thoughtful navigation of the pages in a category.  "Writing as if you are talking to someone" is important.  It's not the only requirement for the Web though. -- AaronHawley
