What is specpdl?

You can find references to it in the Emacs source code.


From lisp.h:

  /* Elisp uses multiple stacks:
   - […]
   - The specpdl stack keeps track of backtraces, unwind-protects and
     dynamic let-bindings.  It is allocated from the 'specpdl' array,
     a manually managed stack.
   - […]


What does specpdl mean?

Please document specpdl here or link to documentation. Or add comments to the C code.


In lisp.h you can also find: ~~union specbinding~~, ~~enum specbind_tag~~.

The variable max-specpdl-size is now obsolete and you should use max-lisp-eval-depth
