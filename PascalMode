Emacs comes with **Pascal Mode** - a major mode that adds features to be used while programming in the Pascal programming language.

== Using Pascal Mode ==

Pascal mode may start automatically when Emacs opens a ##.pas## file. You may also use ##M-x pascal-mode##

Pascal mode comes with several functions, including:

* ##M-x pascal-beg-of-defun## - Move point to the beginning of the last block.
* ##M-x outline-mode## - Collapse all codeblocks to get a birds-eye view of your code.
* ##M-x show-all## - Re-expand all collapsed blocks.
* ##M-x capitalize-keywords## - Make keywords start with a capital letter.

== Customization ==

You can see different customization options for Pascal mode by using ##M-x customize-group RET pascal##
