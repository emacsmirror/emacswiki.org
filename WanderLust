* Can use address manager (included in WL) and/or [[BBDB]] as addressbook

Wanderlust has //very// good IMAP support; it leaves messages on the server & caches them. It integrates with [[BBDB]], supports MIME, and can integrate with Mailcrypt. MIME and PGP/MIME is handled via [[Semi]].

== Installing Wanderlust ==

WanderLust is installable via [[MELPA]] or [[el-get]].

Alternatively, you may be able to find `wanderlust', `wl', or `wl-beta' from your system's package manager.

== Basic Usage ==
Wanderlust has four basic buffers: '''Folder''' buffer, '''Summary''' buffer, '''Message''' buffer/view, and '''Draft''' buffer. 

Wanderlust starts in folder buffer, from which you can open a summary buffer (press "q" to close), which lists a summary of all messages in chosen folder. Navigate up/down with n/p, and N/P (only unread messages). Open a message for viewing with RET, and scroll up/down with SPC/BKSPC or RET/M-RET for line-scrolling. You can jump to the message with "j" for copying text, for instance, and press "q" to go back to summary buffer. Pressing "v" hides the message buffer, and "l" toggles the list of folders (folder buffer). 

Pressing a/A opens the draft buffer for answering the message at point with/without citing the message. To write a new message press "w". You can auto complete email addresses (form ~/.addresses), with TAB in the draft buffer. 

There's tons of more stuff you can do so reading the manual is a must. (<code>M-x info RET >> C-s Wanderlust</code>). The manual is also available at [http://wanderlust.github.io/wl-docs/wl.html Github].


== Configuration (Quickstart) ==

For the new user, configuration can be confusing. This guide aims to ease that pain.

To get started, add the following line to your InitFile:
<pre>
(autoload 'wl "wl" "Wanderlust" t)
</pre>

As well as your init file, wl reads ~/.folders. See [[.wl]] and [[.folders]] for more tips.

We want to tell Wanderlust where our email account is. We can do this in <code>~/.folders</code>:

{{{
# The .folders file: Specify our folders and accounts.

# Connect to an IMAP server with %
%INBOX:"me@example.com"/clear@mail.example.com:993! "INBOX"

# Or from an MH folder with +
# +~/mail/inbox

# Or from a maildir folder with .
# .~/maildir/inbox

# Or from an NNTP server with -
# -some.group@some.nntp.server
}}}

Then from inside Emacs, you can use <code>M-x wl</code> to start Wanderlust. If you're connecting directly to your IMAP server, you will be asked for a password. Afterwards, if you use <code>M-x elmo-passwd-alist-save</code>, your password will be stored in <code>~/.elmo/passwd</code>

* `m p' - Give a folder a nickname.
* `s' - Sync with the server (check for new mail)
* `q' - Quit Wanderlust
* <code>?</code> - Get a help menu

Wanderlust doesn't automatically display your IMAP folders. You can do so by adding <code>%/</code> to your <code>.folders</code> file. There are also other types, as per this example:

{{{
# Display all IMAP folders in reverse order.
# Use 'M s' to sort alphabetically.
%/

# Produce a tree of shimbun feeds, which you can browse:
@/

# Show newsgroups available on your default NNTP server:
~/
}}}

=== Setting up with Gmail ===
Check that you have enabled IMAP in your Gmail account settings, then put the following in your .wl:
{{{

;; For non ascii-characters in folder-names
(setq elmo-imap4-use-modified-utf7 t)

;; SMTP
(setq
  wl-smtp-connection-type   'starttls         ; Use TLS
  wl-smtp-posting-port      587               ; The SMTP port
  wl-smtp-authenticate-type "plain"           ; Authentication type
  wl-smtp-posting-user      "myname"          ; Username
  wl-smtp-posting-server    "smtp.gmail.com"  ; SMTP server
  wl-local-domain           "gmail.com"       ; The SMTP server again
  wl-message-id-domain      "smtp.gmail.com") ; And... Again?

(setq
  ;; All system folders (draft, trash, spam, etc) are placed in the
  ;; [Gmail]-folder, except inbox. "%" means it's an IMAP-folder
  wl-default-folder "%inbox"
  wl-draft-folder   "%[Gmail]/Drafts"
  wl-trash-folder   "%[Gmail]/Trash"

  ;; The below is not necessary when you send mail through Gmail's SMTP server,
  ;; see https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892?hl=en&rd=1
  ;; wl-fcc            "%[Gmail]/Sent"

  wl-from "Me <myname@gmail.com>"  ; Our From: header field
  wl-fcc-force-as-read t           ; Mark sent mail (in the wl-fcc folder) as read
  wl-default-spec "%")             ; For auto-completion
}}}

See [[WlMultipleAccounts]] for a more detailed example.

=== Problems ===

* I have the "Cannot generate valid FQDN" message on the minibuffer when sending. 

Check the variable `wl-local-domain' and `stmp-local-domain'. It should have a real domain, at least "localhost". See the previous example.

* When I send an email with starttls, wanderlust first stalls for a long time after "Opening...done" and the aborts with "invalid type: arrayp nil". This happens with three different accounts (web de, gmail, yahoo).

* How do I format an IMAP folder entry line if my username includes a domain name? (e.g. Microsoft campus university addresses)?

If the appropriate elmo-imap4-default-* variables are set then this is no problem. For individual folder entry lines, quote the username@domain, e.g.:
%/:'username@campus.someuniversity.edu'/clear@serverdomain.com:993!
