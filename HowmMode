Howm allows you to take notes fragmentarily and browse them collectively.
It has hyperlinks and full-text search like EmacsWikiMode.
It is a minor mode and can be combined with other modes.

* https://howm.osdn.jp/

There is no distinction between pages - each record can be arbitrarily
timestamped, hyperlinked, and displayed with other related pages in
one buffer, if needed. Quite convenient if one wants what did he put
in about X, and next day - what was marked as Y. Very practical tool
for organizing notes into ad-hoc searchable ontology.

The interesting thing about this mode is that it doesn't only have
"normal" forward pointing links -- it also has backwards pointing
links:

'''Goto link''': These can point to keywords or to filenames.

      >>> ~/BabyloniaWave.txt
      >>> highway planet

'''Come-from link''': These can point "from" keywords.

      <<< crystal star cluster

The string 'crystal star cluster' in all other files will now automatically point here.

Todo and Notifiers are created as you type and displayed in a separate buffer according to the importance, so you can click and see the context of the appontment. 


''The format is as follows:''

[YYYY-MM-DD]- sink after the date (reminder)

[YYYY-MM-DD]+ float after the date (todo)

[YYYY-MM-DD]! float until the date (deadline)

As for recurring scheduled tasks, you can simply list them :-)
<pre>
      [2005-06-13]@ hogehoge
      [2005-06-20]@ hogehoge
      [2005-06-27]@ hogehoge
      [2005-07-04]@ hogehoge
</pre>
A method to input such lists is described in https://howm.osdn.jp/README.html

: Thanks to SebastianBlatt for this question; it was not documented in English.
I am lazy and tend to leave problems until someone gives comments. --khi

: That's pretty convenient, thanks! One more question, though: is it possible to get howm to query the diary file or abuse diary-lib (diary-mode supports cyclic tasks and also has a nice entry format to specify e.g. the third Monday of August), so that I wouldn't have to enter holidays by hand every year? ...yes, I know I'm lazy. :-) --SebastianBlatt

Some codes to integrate howm and diary are found in HowmAndCalendar (pasted by --DavidOtoole for convenience)
(Please search the word "mark-calendar" in this page).
I expect everyone can read elisp part at least.

These codes provide the below features.

(calendar to howm)
* If you write "%hdiary" in your menu file ~/howm/0000-00-00-000000.howm, schedule from diary is shown in howm menu by "C-c , ,".
* M-x calendar, move TextCursor to a certain date, and type "d" to search that date in howm notes.

(howm to calendar)
* Dates for tasks in howm notes are highlighted in calendar.
* Type "d" in howm menu to open calendar.

I have a question: is it possible to show and maybe highlight "missed" appointments in the Schedule section? That is, appointments of the form "[date]@ text" that were not explicitly finished by hitting RET on the "@"? --SebastianBlatt

This should work. --[[khi]]
<pre>
    ;; show schedule items in menu...
    (setq howm-menu-schedule-days-before (* 365 30)) ;; from (today - X days)
    (setq howm-menu-schedule-days 7) ;; to (today + Y days)
</pre>

Highlighting is not available at now. How about "separators" instead?
* Write %reminder instead of %schedule and %todo in menu file 0000-00-00-000000.howm. Both appointments and todo items are shown in an unified form. (experimental hidden feature)
* Set separator lines as you like.
<pre>
    (setq howm-menu-reminder-separators
          '(
            ;; missed
            (-1  . "----------- m -----------------")
            ;; today
            (0   . "----------- 0 -----------------")
            ;; 1-3 days
            (3   . "----------- 3 -----------------")
            ;; 3-7 days
            (nil . "----------- t -----------------")
            ;; todo
            ))
</pre>

== Discussion ==

[new] Is there any way to have "templates" in howm ? I mean, I'd like
to create all my notes and put them in a "inbox" category (goto-link)
so that I could review them easily at each end of day ?
Also, is there any possibility exclude certain tags when searching for
notes ? -- XavierMaillard

Yes. Please read docstring of the variable `howm-template'.
You can exclude certain notes by typing C-u f contents RET
or C-u f summary RET in *howmS* buffer. -- [[khi]]

[new:XavierMaillard:2008-10-26 18:35 UTC]
Yes, I have seen it after having asked it here ... -- [[XavierMaillard]]
----


I already have a directory of notes. Can howm-mode take it from there ? [[ychaouche]]

[[ychaouche]]

Answere from [[khi]]:

<pre>
; howm-mode :)
;; search other directories in addition to `howm-directory'.
(setq howm-search-path '("/path/to/notes/directory" "/path/to/other/notes/directory"))
(setq howm-search-other-dir t)
</pre>

== Workflow Possibilities ==

=== Stagewise filtering of notes based on grep as well as keywords ===

Say you are part of a team or project called ABCD and have a frequent number of meetings. These can be captured as notes including a defined howm keyword ABCD.

Now, in those meetings, there would be different topics and linking to other keywords. These keywords can be added to the notes as required.

One specific example that would be often necessary would be links to specific Confluence pages pertaining to a subject. While browser bookmarks would also work - it may be more difficult to maintain context and include notes along with it. Confluence pages tend to have a specific URL structure, like company.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/XXX. Since these are notes, it is likely you would have some additional 'description words' surrounding the link in the meeting note.


1. howm-list-grep-fixed (=C-c , s=) > choose ABCD for obtaining notes mentioning keyword ABCD.

2. howm-search-in-result (=G=) > 'wiki' which will filter above notes to those containing confluence links.

3. If you remember something close to the description words related to the confluence link - you then hit =G= again and search within the filtered notes to find notes with those description words.

   With the above method, it is then possible to find the desired link, and also have a view of other notes that are related to the description words, and thus being able to form more connections between notes!Say you are part of a team or project called ABCD and have a frequent number of meetings.

Since these are notes, it is likely you would have some additional 'description words' surrounding the link in the meeting note.

The workflow to quickly identify confluence links:

1. howm-list-grep-fixed (`C-c , s`) > choose ABCD for obtaining notes mentioning keyword ABCD.

2. howm-search-in-result (`G`) > 'wiki' which will filter above notes to those containing confluence links.

3. If you remember something close to the description words related to the confluence link - you then hit `G` again and search within the filtered notes to find notes with those description words.

With the above method, it is possible to find the desired link, and also have a view of other notes that are related to the description words, and thus being able to form more connections between notes! Note that when you hit 'G` to grep within results, it is also possible to call up `howm-insert-keyword` (C-c , i) to insert a keyword as a search term, and thus filter based on other howm defined keywords in the filtered notes.
