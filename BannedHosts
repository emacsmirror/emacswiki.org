# This page lists all banned hosts and IP numbers.  The page is
# locked; only administrators can edit it.

# Post on EmacsWikiAdministrators if you would like to get unbanned,
# or if you would like to help maintain this list.  That page also
# shows how we arrived at IP ranges, if we're blocking ranges.

# A lot of innocent people can be banned if entire networks are being
# banned.  Sometimes this is the only solution since the banned person
# is using a dynamic IP and hostname assigned by the ISP.

# Generally, we prefer to use BannedContent to fight link spam.
# Banning hosts and IP numbers is for vandals and leeches.

# If you got banned because you leeched the site (downloaded all the
# pages), please get the page database instead.  See
