Polymode is a framework for multiple major modes (MMM) inside a single Emacs buffer. It is fast and has a simple but flexible object oriented design. Creating new polymodes normally takes a few lines of code.

Polymode also provides configurable facilities for literate programming - exporters, weavers and tanglers.
