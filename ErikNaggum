Erik Naggum (1965&ndash;2009) was a Norwegian software engineer. He contributed many patches to GNU Emacs from version 19.26 to 20.4. A fan of [CommonLisp Common Lisp], he took [EmacsLisp Emacs Lisp] in the direction of Common Lisp. He contributed early support for multiple character sets. He quit over the [http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3074457554801967%40naggum.no introduction of MULE] to GNU Emacs and for a while maintained a "multi-byte survival kit" for Emacs 20 users who wanted Emacs 19 character set behaviour (see below).

One of the last big flamers on Usenet, veteran of countless flame wars on [http://groups.google.com/groups?&as_ugroup=comp.emacs comp.emacs] and [http://groups.google.com/groups?&as_ugroup=comp.lang.lisp comp.lang.lisp], like [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_thread/thread/21744d089a3f1b79?tvc=2&q=naggum+suicide this one].

== Multi-Byte Survival Kit ==

He is also the author of a "Multi-Byte Survival Kit" for Emacs 20, which removed all MULE functionality.

 [. . .]  I used to think that I needed to walk through the
 sources of stuff that I put on my machine, but it became impossible after
 only a few years: it's too much work, and it has no direct rewards.  I
 also used to modify my Emacs quite a bit, and since I excised MULE from
 20.3, it took too much effort to keep track of changes (it turns out that
 semantic collisions are much more important than syntactic collisions,
 which CVS could take care of -- code you haven't changed could be changed
 incompatibly with other changes you have made, wreaking serious havoc),
 so now I haven't been able to upgrade to 20.4-sans-MULE, even though 20.4
 has been released.

 [. . .] RedHat included my
 "MultiByte Survival Kit" in their distribution of
 Emacs 20.2.  and while 20.2 MBSK .elc files could be loaded into 20.2
 pure, a change was made so that 20.2 MBSK .elc files could not be
 loaded into 20.3, but 20.2 pure .elc files could, obviously only to
 discourage further branching.

 I have a "standard" PC keyboard (except with tons of function keys) and
 have moved the digits off the normal keypad and onto the numeric keypad
 and moved all the shifted symbols down to unshifted, and then physically
 moved the column that used to read 6YHN and all columns right of it one
 column right.  The vacated holes in they keyboard are filled with whatever
 left-over keys you have, and then you tell your keyboard driver og X or
 whatever that you have placed the parens {} [] () and <> (unshifted and
 shifted) in what used to be the 6YHN colum.  This move some incredibly
 frequently used keys to between your index fingers instead of terrorizing
 your right little finger.  Also, return and backspace are now one column
 closer and also strain the little finger much less.  You also get a little
 more space between your hands, which some of those ergonomic stunts seem
 to argue is a good thing.  Also, with Unicode, typing becomes much more
 fun than remembering those TeX monstrosities, but the downside is that you
 need a lot more keys.  So AltGr is also one column closer to your right
 thumb and painless to use even with other keys on the right hand.  Then
 the left thumb can be used for space, too, or the Alt key that you can use
 to teach Emacs to use much shorter commands.  Also, remap the useless CAPS
 key to something useful, like window manager shortcuts.  The really good
 thing about this keyboard layout is that your computer is /secure/ even if
 someone should break in and get console access.

== Common Lisp and Emacs ==

I believe he used Emacs, but preferred Common Lisp. Naggum is the author of <tt>[CommonLispHyperspec hyperspec.el]</tt>, a package to browse documentation from the Common Lisp !HyperSpec. He actually planned to implement a [CommonLispEmacs Common Lisp Emacs]. And here's why he would like to see it come about (edited by AlexSchroeder from the [http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3210587938166206%40naggum.net original post]):

 My primary concern is the educational value of a Common Lisp
 application that could replace the bogus Emacs Lisp as a demonstration
 of what a good Lisp can do.  There is also the speed and convenience
 of many sorts, but that is way below the effect of enhancing the
 Common Lisp systems because they suddenly have to face up to a much
 larger user community who will have all the needs that are not with
 the current systems, and hopefully will be enthusiastic about a
 "better Emacs" and want to do stuff in it, which will then be a real
 Common Lisp environment that can compile their files and such things,
 not just an application that is fairly closed.

 Common Lisp code is very easy to write correctly when you figure out the
 indentation that the editor does for you.  Do not fight the indentation,
 no matter what you think about it.  If you think you know better, forget
 it, you do not.

 I once said: "Those who do not know Lisp are doomed to reinvent it"
 in an Emacs setting.  This is a Lisp setting, so maybe I should say:
 "Those who do not know Emacs are doomed to reinvent it".

== On elegance ==

 Subject: read the fine manual, please

 the clumsiness of people who have to engage their brain at every step is
 unbearably painful to watch, at least to me, and that's what the
 novice-friendly software makes people do, because there's no elegance in
 them, it's just a mass of features to be learned by rote.  however, this
 suits people a hell of a lot better than setting out at age 6 to become a
 great ballet dancer and achieving their goal 20 years later after every
 tendon and muscle and joint has been asked to perform just a little bit
 more than nature ever intended over and over and over again.  to most
 people, this is insanity.  but in reality, it's art, and it's the _art_
 in what we do that makes us human.

== On size ==

 it is often said that small is beautiful.  now, anything can be beautiful
 when it is small.  the ugliest person you can think of was probably a quite
 pretty baby.  it doesn't take much effort to find a beautiful 16-year-old
 girl, either.  in fact, our modern notions of beauty and elegance are
 _defined_ in terms of size and maturity, so the chance of anything small
 and immature being beautiful is vastly higher than anything big or mature.
 now, despite all the marketing that seems to be aimed at telling me that I
 should dump a girlfriend when she becomes 25 and get a new 16-year-old (or
 even younger), I plan to stay with mine partly because of her ability to
 grow older in a way I like.  consequently, I take exceptions to the
 pedophilic attitudes to beauty and elegance that our societies have adopted
 over the years.  this is why I don't like the "small is beautiful" model of
 aesthetics.  this is why I think that almost anybody could make something
 small and beautiful, but only a few can create something that grows from
 small to huge and still remains beautiful.  but then again, look at
 interior architecture -- with huge spaces come a need for size-reducing
 ornamentation.  the scaling process _itself_ adds "junk" to what was "clean
 surfaces" in a small model.  Schemers refer to Common Lisp's "warts", and
 prefer to think of Scheme as "clean".  now, I wonder, would Schemers prefer
 to live in small houses with nothing on their walls?  would they still
 prefer this if the walls were a 100 feet high and 200 feet long, or would
 they, too, desire some ornamentation that would have looked _very_ bad if
 it had been on a 10 by 20 feet wall?
