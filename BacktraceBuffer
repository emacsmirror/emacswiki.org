The *Backtrace* buffer is an Elisp Debugger (DebuggerMode).  This page
shows you how to work with it.

= Quitting =

The most important command in debugger-mode is `q' to quit.  You might
have to switch to the *Backtrace* buffer, first.

If you kill the *Backtrace* window without quitting (`q'), you continue to be in a ''recursive edit''. The MajorMode indicated in the ModeLine is enclosed in square brackets:

    --11:**-F1  *scratch*      [(Lisp Interaction)]--L8--All---------------------

In order to ''leave'' a recursive edit, do `C-]' (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>) or `ESC-ESC-ESC' (<code>keyboard-escape-quit</code>).

= Example =

Use `M-x set-variable' to set the variable `debug-on-quit' to t.  Then
evaluate the following piece of code, and then hit C-g to quit.

    (let ((n 0))
      (while t
        (setq n (+ n 1))))

This will pop up the *Backtrace* buffer and start the Debugger.
Here's what it will look like (more or less, depending on when you hit
C-g to interrupt Emacs:

    Debugger entered--Lisp error: (quit)
      (while t (setq n (+ n 1)))
      (let ((n 0)) (while t (setq n ...)))
      eval((let ((n 0)) (while t (setq n ...))))
      eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
      eval-last-sexp(nil)
      call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)

The first line tells you what caused Emacs to enter DebuggerMode, and
the second line tells you what Emacs will do next.  The following
lines tell you how Emacs got there.  The last line tells you what
started all of this.  Note how I obviously called `eval-last-sexp' to
start the computation.

[new]
Is there a way to go to the file and line corresponding to a stack frame?

== Evaluation ==

To evaluate an expression in the example above, use `e'.  In my case,
for example, I checked the value of the variable n.  It was 1093196.

== Stepping, Continuing ==

To step through code one step at a time, use `d'.

To continue the computation, use `c'.
