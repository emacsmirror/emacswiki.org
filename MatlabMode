== What it is ==

A major mode for editing MATLAB (*.m) files containing MATLAB code. MATLAB from http://www.mathworks.com is proprietary software for numerical maths and data analysis.  Also note that Emacs (21.3 onwards) comes with an alternative built in: octave mode.  Octave is a free software alternative to Matlab. 

The matlab-mode package also enables editing of Target Language Compiler (*.tlc) files.

To setup and use it, see https://github.com/MathWorks/Emacs-MATLAB-Mode
