== Me ==

a.k.a casouri.

I started using Emacs in 2017 when I was a freshman in college. I've been playing with it ever since.

You can find me on [https://emacs-china.org emacs-china] under the name casouri, or visit [https://archive.casouri.cat/note my blog]. I put all the packages I wrote on [https://www.github.com/casouri github]. 

[https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs My init.el]

== Some EMACS expansions that I like ==

    Eight       Megabytes      And        Constantly   Swapping      ;; hard to beat
    Even a      Master of      Arts       Comes        Simpler
    Emacs       Makes          A          Computer     Slow
    Elsewhere   Maybe          All        Commands are Simple
    Excellent   Manuals        Are        Clearly      Suppressed
    Embarrassed Manual-Writer  Accused of Communist    Subversion     ;; for the record, Emacs has a fantastic manual



== Development ==

Here are some of the packages that I wrote.

* [https://github.com/casouri/ghelp ghelp]: Generic Help, different backends, same interface. Currently supports helpful and eglot.

* [https://github.com/casouri/trivial-copy trivial-copy]: Copy paste files like you do in Finder. 

* [https://github.com/casouri/isolate isolate]: Like evil-surround.

* [https://github.com/casouri/find-char find-char]: Like `f' in vim.

* [https://github.com/casouri/eldoc-box eldoc-box]: eldoc + childframe. At first, I use it with eglot. Now I don't use it anymore since I wrote ghelp.

Here are some utilities I wrote.

* [https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2019/display-console-in-emacs Display console]

* [https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/insert-math-symbol-in-emacs Insert math symbol]

* [https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2018/easy-bindings-when-region-is-active Fast key when region active]
