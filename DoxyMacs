Doxygen is a system for extracting documentation from source code. It supports a variety of programming languages, human languages and output formats. You can find it at http://www.doxygen.org.

Doxymacs, authored by RyanTSammartino, is a minor-mode for (X)Emacs to edit files containing Doxygen documentation.  You can find it at http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net.

With the doxymacs minor-mode, you can insert doxygen tempo templates, start a browser to see
a symbol's documentation etc.  It also provides syntax highlight.

To generate the doxygen 'tags file' needed by doxymacs, put something like:  

  GENERATE_TAGFILE = ~/.tmp/doxy.tag

in your doxygen config file.

-------

From August 2004, CVS version of GnuEmacs require patching DoxyMacs in order to avoid conflicts in font-lock management:
the `doxymacs-font-lock' function should be implemented as follows (or at leat I think so :-)):

<pre>
(defun doxymacs-font-lock ()
  (interactive)
  (font-lock-add-keywords nil doxymacs-doxygen-keywords))
</pre>

I made a small function that is inspired by Eclipse editing of the Java files.
When the point is inside a multiline comment it automatically adds an asterisk 
when you enter a newline. There may be some minor glitches if you have 
"/*"' or "*/" inside your strings but it works fine in general. There is a piece 
of code at the end that binds the function to return key, use it if you want.

<pre>
(defun my-javadoc-return () 
  "Advanced `newline' command for Javadoc multiline comments.   
Insert a `*' at the beggining of the new line if inside of a comment."
  (interactive "*")
  (let* ((last (point))
         (is-inside
          (if (search-backward "*/" nil t)
              ;; there are some comment endings - search forward
              (search-forward "/*" last t)
            ;; it's the only comment - search backward
            (goto-char last)
            (search-backward "/*" nil t))))

    ;; go to last char position
    (goto-char last)

    ;; the point is inside some comment, insert `*'
    (if is-inside
        (progn
          (newline-and-indent)
          (insert "*"))
      ;; else insert only new-line
      (newline-and-indent))))

(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key (kbd "<RET>") 'my-javadoc-return)))
</pre>

You can use M-j (c-indent-new-comment-line) within comments to get the same effect.

I extend the JakubHozak's solution to work with other one-line comment as well. However, it does not work for lisp-mode. I have no idea why. There is also one bug fix -- old code will not indent properly in the code after pressing Enter.

highlight them to the extent the YARD tags match with the Doxygen
ones.
