This page is about repeatedly using the same [[key]] or [[command]] and getting a different behavior each time.  Such a key or command is no longer idempotent.

Starting with Emacs 23, `C-l' (`recenter-top-bottom') is an example of this: When you hit `C-l' it moves the current line (with [[point]]) to the middle, the top, or the bottom of the screen, in sequence: middle, top, bottom, middle,...  

The code for this is in standard library GIT:window.el.  It is based on `recenter-top-bottom' from <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>.  See the source code for the technique used.

The following are additional ways to make a command or key act differently when it is repeated.

* Use `C-a' and `C-e' repeatedly to zip up and down the beginnings and ends of lines.  First time: bol/eol, subsequently: next/previous line's bol/eol.  See commands `##beginning-of-line+##' and `##end-of-line+##' in <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>.  The keys are bound in <tt>[[setup-keys.el]]</tt>.

* Same thing in `visual-line-mode', use `C-a' and `C-e' repeatedly to zip up and down the beginnings and ends of visual lines.  And use `home' and `end' to move repeatedly across full, logical lines.  See commands `##beginning-of-visual-line+##' and `##end-of-visual-line+##' in <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>.  The keys are bound in <tt>[[setup-keys.el]]</tt>.



* DoReMi -- Use the arrow keys and the mouse wheel to execute a sequence of commands in sequence or to repeat commands.

* ElectricDotAndDash

* RotateText -- Swap between multiple words in a circular list.

* RotateWordCapitalization -- Switch through capitalization possibilities of current word.

* Lisp:sequential-command-config.el -- Bind ##M-u/M-c/M-l## to ##seq-(upcase|capitalize|downcase)-backward-word##. 

* DoubleKeyBinding

* DoubleChar -- Hit a char twice and given a delay get one insertion or another one.

* KeyChord -- Invoke a different command when a single key is quickly pressed twice (or when two keys are pressed simultaneously).
