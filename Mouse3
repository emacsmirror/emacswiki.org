== Mouse-3 in Vanilla Emacs ==

The Emacs mouse is pretty slick.  It is especially handy for selecting and deleting text.  If you are not yet familiar with it, spend some time playing with it and reading the manual about it: [[Manual:Mouse Commands]].

In particular, learn about using `mouse-1' and `mouse-3' together to select text.  Practice double-clicking or triple-clicking `mouse-1' followed by (single) clicking `mouse-3'.

After you select text using the mouse, a second `mouse-3' click at the same spot deletes the selected text.  It [[kill]]s it if you set [[option]] `mouse-drag-copy-region' to non-`nil' -- then the mouse selection is the same as the Emacs [[region]].

This is very handy.  It lets you use only the mouse to kill or delete arbitrary chunks of text.

For example, double-click `mouse-1' on a word, then click `mouse-3' on a different word (anywhere within the word), to select both words and the text between them.  Then immediately click `mouse-3' at the same spot, to delete the selected text.  Similarly, triple-click `mouse-1' to select a line, click `mouse-3' to extend the selection through some other line, then click `mouse-3' to delete the selected lines.






== Library mouse3.el ==

Perhaps you know about `C-mouse-3' in Emacs.  It pops up a context-sensitive menu.  The sensitivity only goes as far as the major mode, however.

* If the [[menu bar]] is not shown currently, the popup menu has submenus that are the same as the menu-bar menus, giving you on-demand access to all of the menu-bar menus.

* If the menu bar is showing, then the popup menu has submenus that correspond to the [[major mode]].  (These same menus typically appear also in the menu bar.)

Library <tt>[[mouse3.el]]</tt> lets you pop up such a menu by using only `mouse-3' -- no need to use the keyboard (hitting the `Control' key).  Yet you can still use `mouse-3' to extend and delete the selection.

And since `mouse-3' normally extends the selection, when you use `mouse-3' to pop up a menu it can be a menu that pertains to the current selection.  That is, the menu can be ''sensitive to the selection'' context.

How does it work?

=== Variable, Not Hardwired, Behavior for `mouse-save-then-kill' ===

The [[command]] bound to `mouse-3' is `mouse-save-then-kill'.  It is a complicated command that analyzes the history (state) of previous mouse commands to "do the right thing".  IOW, it is a DWIM ("do what I mean") command.  If the previous command was also `mouse-save-then-kill' and the `mouse-3' click is at the same spot, then there is no target location for extending the selection so it instead kills or deletes it.

This deletion action is hardcoded: a click at the same spot always deletes the selection.  But it is only one possible action that you might want to apply to the selection/region.  Perhaps you instead want to copy the region to a [[register]], or check its spelling, or print it, or encrypt it, or ...

Library ##mouse3.el## lets you define the behavior.  It redefines standard command `mouse-save-then-kill' in a trivial way to give you
custom behavior for a second `mouse-3' click at the same spot.

The redefined `mouse-save-then-kill' command just
uses function `mouse3-second-click-command' to handle a second
click at the same spot.  That function returns the command that `mouse-save-then-kill' invokes: either the command that is the value of [[variable]]
`mouse3-save-then-kill-command' or, if that is `nil' the command that
is the value of [[user option]] '''`mouse3-second-click-default-command''''.


[:Icicles]
Special contexts can bind variable `mouse3-save-then-kill-command'
to provide particular behavior.  For example, '''[[Icicles]]''' does this
during [[minibuffer]] [[completion]] so that a second `mouse-3' at the same spot in
buffer `*Completions*' marks the selected completions (saves them for
later reuse).

You can use option `mouse3-second-click-default-command' to
customize the behavior to either pop up a menu or invoke any
command you choose.  The default value is
`mouse3-region-popup-menu', which pops up a menu.  To obtain the
vanilla Emacs behavior,
customize the option value to command `mouse3-kill/delete-region'.

Option '''`mouse3-double-click-command'''' associates a command with a
`mouse-3' ''double''-click.  The default value is command
`mouse3-kill/delete-region', so with the default setup you can kill
or delete the selected text by double-clicking `mouse-3' instead of
single clicking.  In other words, in the default setup you have two
possibilities:

* '''2nd single-click:''' Pop up a menu so you can choose how to act on the
selected text.

* '''double-click:''' Kill or delete the selection, according to
standard option `mouse-drag-copy-region'.

If you choose to customize one of these two options,
`mouse3-second-click-default-command' or
`mouse3-double-click-command', then you will probably want to
customize both of them.

To make either a single-click or a double-click do nothing,
customize the appropriate option to the command `ignore'.


: ''Note:''

: I do not recommend that you try reversing the option values from
their defaults, so that a double-click pops up a menu and the
second single-click at the same spot deletes the selected text.
That does not work well in general because of a flaw (or a feature,
depending on your view) in the Emacs design.

: Here's the problem: When you double-click to get the menu, Emacs
first sends a single-click event, before the double-click event.
(That's the flaw/feature.)  So if you double-click at the same spot
then the selection is first deleted, before the menu pops up.

: If you double-click at a different spot then this does not happen,
but instead the selection is extended or reduced to match the
double-click position.  The selection might then not be the region
you want the menu items to act on.  Things work pretty well,
however, if you start selecting by double-clicking `mouse-1', click
`mouse-3' here and there to extend, and finally double-click
`mouse-3' near the end of the selection, because in that case the
double-click position does not extend the selection any more.

: In sum, in general I do not recommend that you reverse the default
values.  If you want `mouse-3' to pop up a menu, it is better to
either (a) use the default setup so that the menu pops up on the
second single-click, not on a double-click or (b) let
`mouse3-double-click-command' pop up the menu, but set
`mouse3-second-click-default-command' to a command other than
`mouse3-kill/delete-region'.





== Customized Pop-Up Menu ==

If you choose for `mouse-3' to pop up a menu then you can customize
that menu using various user options.  The command that pops up the
menu is '''`mouse3-region-popup-menu''''.  See the documentation for that
command for more explanation of the use of options.

A fairly complete default menu is provided out of the box, so you
do not need to customize anything unless you want to.

`mouse3-region-popup-menu' ultimately invokes standard function
`x-popup-menu' to do its work.  The menu definition used by
`x-popup-menu' can take two alternative forms which are quite
different.  Which form you choose to use is controlled by option
'''`mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag''''.

If that option is `nil' (the default value), you can use [[keymap]]s and [[Manual:Extended Menu Items|extended menu items]] to define the popup menu.  This is ''recommended''.
If the value is non-`nil' then you can use option
`mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' to make use of the alternative,
`x-popup-menu'-specific form.

That alternative form is easy to use, but it does not offer you all
of the possibilities that a standard menu definition does.  In
particular, it does not let you provide ''keywords'' such as `##:visible##'
and `##:enable##' that control the display and makeup of submenus and
menu items.  Examples of both methods are provided in file ##mouse3.el##.

The default behavior takes advantage of keywords to dynamically
remove or disable submenus and menu items that are inappropriate
for the current context.  For example, it removes or disables
buffer-modifying items and submenus if the current [[buffer]] is
read-only, and it removes or disables [[region]]-related items and
submenus when the region is empty.

The rest of the description here assumes that
`mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag' is `nil' (the default value
and recommended).

You can optionally include, at the beginning of the menu, a submenu
that has, as its own submenus, the global menus that are currently
available.  (These are the same menus that are popped up by
`C-mouse-3'.)  This is controlled by option
'''`mouse3-region-popup-include-global-menus-flag''''.  If the [[menu bar]]
is not shown currently, then these submenus are the menu-bar menus.
Otherwise they are the major-mode menus.

For example, if the menu bar is showing, then in [[Dired]] mode the
first submenu is '''Dired by name''', which itself has submenus
'''Operate''', '''Mark''', '''Regexp''', '''Immediate''', and '''Subdir'''.

You define the rest of the popup menu (other than the global part)
using submenu keymaps and `menu-item' bindings ([[Manual:Extended Menu Items|extended menu items]]).  You do this by customizing option
'''`mouse3-region-popup-entries''''.  You can reuse existing keymaps or
create menu items and submenus from scratch.  See the documentation
for `mouse3-region-popup-entries'.  If you reuse existing keymaps
you can add their menu items either as a submenu or as individual
items.










== Mode-Specific Popup Menu ==

You can provide mode-specific behavior by either replacing the
default `mouse-3' popup menu or augmenting it with mode-specific
entries.

Library ##mouse3.el## provides useful behavior for [[Dired]] mode.  You can do
the same for other modes you use.  Simple example code is also
provided in ##mouse3.el## for [[PictureMode|Picture]] mode.  The menu implementation for these
two modes is different, to give you an idea of what is possible.
For Dired mode, `mouse3-region-popup-entries' is used.  For Picture
mode, `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' is used, and both
`mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag' and
`mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' are made buffer-local.

The example code for Picture mode provides actions on the rectangle
defined by the region: items such as '''Draw Rectangle''' and '''Clear Rectangle'''.

Let's look at the behavior for Dired mode in more detail.  The
vanilla Emacs behavior just raises an error, because Dired is
read-only.  Why not let a second `mouse-3' click at the same spot
do something wrt the selected file and dir names?  Two obvious
possibilities come to mind: toggle whether each file/dir is marked,
or pop up a menu that lets you act in various ways on each of the
selected files and dirs.

Option '''`mouse3-dired-function'''' lets you choose between these two
behaviors.  The default value is `mouse3-dired-use-menu', which
means to pop up a menu.  This is just like the default popup menu
except that it has an additional submenu, '''Selected Files''', that is
Dired-specific.  The first submenu is the global major-mode menu,
'''Dired by name'''.  The second, '''Selected Files''', has items that act
on the files and directories that are selected (in the [[region]]):

* '''Mark'''
* '''Unmark'''
* '''Toggle Marked/Unmarked'''
* '''Flag for Deletion'''
* '''Stop Using Menu'''

That last item just switches from having `mouse-3' pop up a menu to
having it toggle the markings of the selected files (the
alternative behavior of `mouse3-dired-function').

If you also use library '''[[Dired+]]''', which I recommend,
then that last menu item is not present, and when the region is
empty you get a different popup menu which pertains only to the
file where you clicked `mouse-3'.

You can see the popup menus for '''Dired+''' [[DiredPlus#Mouse3PopupMenus|here]].







== Context-Specific Behavior (for Emacs-Lisp Programmers) ==

As mentioned [[#Icicles|above]], '''Icicles''' provides an example of a program
imposing [[Icicles - Candidate Sets#SavingAndRetrieving|context-specific behavior]] for the second `mouse-3' click
at the same spot.  The context in this case is (a) [[completion]] and
(b) clicking in buffer `*Completions*'.  For that, '''Icicles''' sets a
buffer-local value of variable `mouse3-save-then-kill-command'.

If you write EmacsLisp code, note that this is an example where
the text is a set of entries in ''tabular format'' (columns).  Each
`*Completions*' entry (candidate) is defined by its `mouse-face' property, not
by its text.  For example, it is not delimited by whitespace
(completion candidates can contain spaces and newlines).  A
context-specific function picks up the set of selected completions
as a list.

Similar opportunities can exist for other ''tabular or line-list
data'': `*Buffer List*', compile/grep output, [[Info]] breadcrumbs,...
Use your imagination.  The Dired example is typical here: the
[[region]] sweeps out text linearly, but the only thing we are really
interested in are the file and subdirectory names that are inside
the region.
