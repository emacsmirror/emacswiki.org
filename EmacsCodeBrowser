== What is ECB ==
From the web page:

: [::ECB] stands for "Emacs Code Browser".  While Emacs already has good
editing support for many modes, its browsing support is somewhat
lacking. That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational
windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.

: The informational windows can contain:

* A directory tree,
* a list of source files in the current directory,
* a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses the
  Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
  languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
  ECB too)
* a history of recently visited files, 
* the Speedbar and
* output from compilation (the "compilation" window) and other modes like
  help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this window.

: As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible,
even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.

: It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
ready-made window layouts to choose from.

: If you use XEmacs you must have installed the package c-support (contains
hideshow.el). If you want to read the online-help of ECB in HTML-format you
must have the library browse-url (part of the mail-lib XEmacs package)
installed; this package is also needed for submitting problem-reports to the
ECB-maintainers!

== Installation ==

=== ECB requires ===

* Version 1.4 of Eric Ludlam's SemanticBovinator or higher
* Version 0.17 of eieio or higher
* Version 0.15 of speedbar or higher
* Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
  is installed.

=== Get latest version ===
To get the development version easily and set it up you can use [NxhtmlMode nXhtml] which has a tool for this in the nXhtml menus (see nXhtml / Tools / ECB).

<strong>The latest ECB version (2.40) does not work with the CEDET in Emacs 23.2</strong>. The CVS version of ECB, however, works with 23.2. You can get it with the following
command:

<code>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@ecb.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ecb co -P ecb</code> 

As of september 2012, the CVS ecb version does not work with the bzr Emacs version: <em>ECB 2.40 - Error: ECB can only be used with cedet [1.0pre6, 1.0.9]! Please install it and restart Emacs!</em>. The current CEDET is 1.1

There is patched version of ECB that works with fresh Emacs & CEDET.  See http://alexott.blogspot.com/2012/06/ecb-fresh-emacscedet.html for more details on installation

=== Via package ===
The patched version of ECB is also available on the [[MELPA]] package repository.
