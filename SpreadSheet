Several packages provide the capabilities for working with Spreadsheets (See [[WikiPedia:Spreadsheet]]) in Emacs.

* SimpleEmacsSpreadsheet --  A major mode in Emacs that mimics traditional spreadsheet software, but uses EmacsLisp formulas.
* [[Dismal]] -- An older spreadsheet mode
* [[ESheet]] -- A spreadsheet with its own extensible formula language.
* SpreadMode -- A formula language that Emacs can generate spreadsheets from.
* LatexSpread -- A simple spreadsheet minor mode for TeX/LaTeX documents.
LaTeX files can include formulas for Emacs to evaluate.
* [[OrgMode]] -- Its table editor uses AdvancedDeskCalculator to
  provide spreadsheet functionality. All the power of Calc in a grid!
* [[CellMode]] -- Visual dataflow language with a spreadsheet interface
* [http://table.sourceforge.net/ Table.el] -- Table editor for Emacs

See also

* ElectricFormMode -- calculations in a buffer, but free-form
* UnXls -- reading MS Excel spreadsheet files

Using NT Xemacs, could only get [[Dismal]] to work properly. It compiled and worked, pretty much 'out of the box'. Using it for a simple timesheet app.

[[CellMode]] would appear to be unavailable. The link to the application is broken on the [[CellMode]] page. An Internet search found nothing. -ColinBaxter
