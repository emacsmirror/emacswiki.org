BufferMenu has various options to sort the listing of buffers.  According to the EmacsManual.

: ''The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the buffers that were current most recently come first.''

What the manual fails to mention is that you can change the sorting with `M-x Buffer-menu-sort'

; `M-2 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''name''.
; `M-3 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''size'' (ascending).
; `M-4 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''mode'' name.
; `M-5 M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by buffer ''file'' name.
; `M-x Buffer-menu-sort': Sort by ''display time'' (default).

Some of these might vary by version. Also note that in some GUI versions, you can just click on the column's name (e.g. click on Size to sort by size).

If you hit the S key (bound to tabulated-list-sort) in the Buffer Menu, the Buffer Menu is sorted by column.  Unfortunately, there's no command I found for returning tabulated-list-sort-key variable to its default nil value -- except to kill-buffer then buffer-menu to bring it back.

=== Sort by Buffer Name ===

If your buffer list becomes too disorganized, you can sort it using this function:
  
  (defun sort-buffers ()
    "Put the buffer list in alphabetical order."
    (interactive)
    (dolist (buff (buffer-list-sorted)) (bury-buffer buff))
    (when (interactive-p) (list-buffers))
    )
  
  (defun buffer-list-sorted ()
    (sort (buffer-list) 
  	(function
  	 (lambda
  	   (a b) (string<
  		  (downcase (buffer-name a))
  		  (downcase (buffer-name b))
  		  )))))

and bind it with

  (global-set-key "\M-b"    'sort-buffers)

An extension like this became obsolete with Emacs 22.


To permanently customize the default listing order of buffer menu, set `Buffer-menu-sort-column'.  For example, use the following to automatically sort by column Mode.

   (setq Buffer-menu-sort-column 4)

You can easily sort on any column, in both directions, if you use BufferMenuPlus. If you instead use the vanilla BufferMenu, you can still sort the list in a couple of ways. -- DrewAdams

[This](https://gist.github.com/offby1/1163610) lets you sort by directory name.  I find this handy when working on a bunch of unrelated projects. -- EricHanchrow
