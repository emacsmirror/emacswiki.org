The most useful exchange format for address/contact data seems to be vCard (see http://www.imc.org/pdi/).

=Synchronization=

== ASynK ==

ASynK is a python program that performs bi-directional synchronization for Contacts, and works between MS Outlook, Google Contacts, and Emacs BBDB. The project page is at: http://karra-asynk.appspot.com/

==PalmPilot==

Various people have been writing software to sync their BBDB (BbdbMode) with their Palm.

* SyncBBDB by ThomasDeWeese -- Supports BBDB 2.2 and later. ie. file format 6 (recommended on the mailing list), but has dropped off the net.  The source code can still be found in Debian, however, at http://packages.debian.org/stable/source/syncbbdb
* http://www.neilvandyke.org/bbdbpalm/ by NeilVanDyke -- BBDBpalm was developed with BBDB 1.51 (outdated!) (It has also been reported to work with BBDB 2.00.02. -- also outdated)

==General==

Be sure to search the [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net/ BBDB Info mailing-list archives] for the latest stuff.

===Time Stamp===

It seems to me that in order to support proper synchronization, BBDB would need to store a full timestamp, not just the date as it does now. If you synchronize more than one time in a day, this will become an issue or at least an inconvenience. In BBDB v2.x there you can set 'bbdb-time-internal-format' to "%Y-%m-%dT%T%z" to produce full ISO 8601 format. This should be perfect for syncing. See the documentation of 'format-time-string' to find what specifiers you can use. ColinMarquardt. 
 
With BBDB v3 the default timestamp is good enough for sync purposes. ASynK uses this feature to find updates since the last synchronization.

== Two-way CardDAV sync ==
Has anyone got this working?
