This page is about library '''<tt>[[showkey.el]]</tt>''', which shows keys and other events as you use them.

You can use this during video recording, so that viewers can easily see what key and mouse actions you use.  Or you can use it to analyze your own interactions.

You can tailor the behavior, to ignore certain event types for display.

There are two global minor modes defined in <tt>showkey.el</tt>, which give you two ways to show keys:

* '''`showkey-tooltip-mode'''' -- Show only the last key used, in a tooltip.  This is refreshed with each such event.

* '''`showkey-log-mode'''' -- Show a log of such events, in a separate frame.  It is refreshed with each new event, and it is kept on top of other frames without stealing the input focus.

Quitting events (`C-g') and events that raise an error are not shown.

A few user options control the behavior:

* '''`showkey-tooltip-ignored-events'''' and
'''`showkey-log-ignored-events'''' are each a list of [[regexp]]s to match
against events that you do not want to show, for
 `showkey-tooltip-mode' and `showkey-log-mode', respectively.

* '''`showkey-log-frame-alist'''' is an a list of frame parameters for
the logging frame.  (It is not used for `showkey-tooltip-mode'.)

* '''`showkey-log-erase-keys'''' is a list of keys that will each
restart logging, that is, erase the log and start it over.  For example, if you add the `RET' key to it (`?\r') then each time it is pressed the log is restarted from scratch.  By default, the list is empty.  (It
is not used for `showkey-tooltip-mode'.)
