[[fr:NouvelUtilisateurEmacsRéférenceSéquencesDeTouches]]
This is a reference for an EmacsNewbie of commonly used Emacs [[key sequence]]s. See also:

* EmacsKeyNotation -- Explain the convention of Emacs key sequences found below.
* EmacsNewbieHelpReference -- The [[key]]s that help you learn Emacs.
* ReferenceCards, CategoryReferenceSheet -- More key lists.

== General ==

* Quit Emacs: `C-x C-c'

== Buffers and Windows ==

* Open a file, existing or new: `C-x C-f' -- then type the file name.
* Save [[Buffer]]: `C-x C-s'
* Save buffer as a different file (Save As): `C-x C-w'
* Save all open buffers: `C-x s'
* Insert a file into buffer: `C-x i'
* Kill current buffer and open another file: `C-x C-v'
* Kill (close) a buffer: `C-x k'
* Split [[Window]]: `C-x 2' or `C-x 3'
* Unsplit windows (maximize selected window, within its [[Frame]]): `C-x 1'
* Select next window: `C-x o'
* Switch to another buffer: `C-x b'
* Buffer menu (list of buffers): `C-x C-b' -- save, delete, open rename buffers

== Cursor Motion ==

These commands move the TextCursor and [[Point]]:

* Forward a character: `C-f'
* Backward a charcter: `C-b'
* Forward a line: `C-n'
* Backward a line: `C-p'
* Go to the beginning of the line: `C-a'
* Go to the end of the line: `C-e'
* Forward a word: `M-f'
* Backward a word: `M-b'
* Forward a sentence: `M-e'
* Backward a sentence: `M-a'
* Go to the beginning of the buffer: ##`M-<'##
* Go to the end of the buffer: ##`M->'##

== Undoing ==

* undo: C-x u, C-_, C-/, or from the menu: `Edit' -> `Undo'. You've undone all changes when the mode line shows `--' instead of `**'
* redo: after undo, C-g and then C-x u
* undo unsaved changes to a buffer: M-x revert-buffer

See also: [[Undo]].


== Canceling ==

* cancel current operation: `C-g'
* if that doesn't happen to work (abort or exit recursive edit): ##`C-]'##,  ##`C-M-c'##
* or ‘M-x top-level’

See also: CancelingInEmacs.


== Whitespace Edits ==

* Indent current line: TAB
* Shift a block of lines rigidly right or left: C-x TAB
* Fill (justify) paragraph: `M-q;
* Add a new line after this one: `RET'
* Open a new line before this one: `C-o'
* Remove all but 1 empty line: `C-x C-o'
* Remove all but 1 space: `M-SPC'

See also: [[Indentation]] and [[Filling]].


== Deleting ==

* Delete character backward: `DEL'
* Delete character forward: `C-d'
* Delete word backward: `M-DEL'
* Delete word forward: `M-D'
* Delete to end of line: `C-k'
* Delete entire line: `C-S-DEL'
* Delete to end of sentence: `M-k'
 
== Selecting and Modifying Regions ==

Copy, cut, paste, select all, ...

* Set mark: `C-SPC', `##C-@##', `M-x set-mark-command'
* Select entire buffer: `C-x h'
* Select page: `C-x C-p'
* Exchange TextCursor position ([[Point]]) and [[Mark]]: `C-x C-x'
* Copy text after setting mark: `C-Insert', `M-w'
* Cut text after setting mark: `C-w', `S-DEL'
* Paste ("yank") text: `C-y', `S-Insert'
* Replace just pasted text with text copied or cut earlier: `M-y'

See also: [[Region]].

== Search or Find and Replace ==

The powerful searching in emacs is called a query

* Search and Replace `M-%' string `RET' newstring `RET'
* Same thing but with a regex use `C-M-%'
* When the search is in progress:
** `SPC' to replace the current match
** `!' to replace all and finish
** `RET' to finish without doing any more replacements

There are a bunch of other features, but that'll get you going

== Other Simple Editing ==

* Make word uppercase: `M-u'
* Make word lowercase: `M-l'
* Capitalize word (first character): `M-c' 
* Transpose (swap) adjacent characters: `C-t'
* Transpose adjacent words: `M-t'
* Transpose lines: `C-x C-t'
* Move line 2 lines forward: `C-u 2 C-x C-t'
* Join previous line: `##M-^##'
* Join next line: `##C-1 M-^##'

[:RepeatingPreviousCommands]
== Repeating Previous Commands ==

* Repeat the most recent command: `C-x z', and again with `z'.
* See the recent commands (displayed in EmacsLisp):  `M-x list-command-history'. Rerun a command by hitting `x' on the line containing a command.
* RepeatingComplexCommand allows you to choose which previous command as EmacsLisp and even modify it.

== Scrolling ==

* Recenter the screen at the TextCursor: `C-l'
* Center the screen at the top:  `C-0 C-l' or `C-u 0 C-l'
* Recenter the screen at the bottom: `C-- C-l' or `C-u - C-l'

== Common User Access (CUA) Keys ==

CUA keys are available with CuaMode, this includes `C-c', `C-x', `C-v' and `C-z' and visible region selection. This mimics the familiar behavior found on in Windows, Mac and Motif.

== VI Keys ==

vi keys are available with ViperMode.
