SteveKemp announced a patch to fns.c on [[gnu.emacs.sources]] which allows Emacs to use shared libraries (2000-02-23).[Groups:fns.c&selm=Pine.GSO.4.10.10002231444090.20962-100000@tardis.tardis.ed.ac.uk]  He called it "Dynamic loading of extensions modules" and "Dynamically Extending Emacs".

The patch eliminated the need to recompile Emacs, by allowing C DEFUN functions to be placed in external libraries and dynamically loaded when they were needed.  The patch is no longer maintained.

DaveLove released a follow up for Emacs that uses libtool.  According to Dave, "this won't get into Emacs until rms is persuaded it's not a GPL threat, probably with some additional hack".

The patch doesn't apply properly even on Emacs 22.

[[XEmacs]] already has something of an FFI:

[[aaptel]] is working (2014-11-27) on a new branch in the git repo (<code>dynamic-modules</code>) dedicated to dynamic loading using libtool (ltdl).
