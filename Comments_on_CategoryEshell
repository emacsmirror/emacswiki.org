I'm not too sure how to begin here. There's a *Categories* section but no *Quick Start* or *Keybindings* sections.

Users need to bounce around many different pages to find answers. 

I'm going to start by *categorizing the categories* (cause I /heard/ you like categories) and trying to append more descriptions to the un-described entries.
