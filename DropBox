[[https://www.dropbox.com/ Dropbox]] is a "free" (as in beer, not as in speech) service for file storage and synchronization.

Q: What emacs files can be stored on dropbox to share between computers running Emacs? config files? site-lisp? home directory? ELPA packages?
** This would presume that the same Emacs version is running on all machines connected to that Dropbox (or do not care about a particular Emacs folder, or are not running shared byte-compiled code).
** or config-files are set to account for this

Does anything get screwed up? -- E.g., lots of dropbox-conflicted files proliferate in a directory? (This happens to me with Pidgin-Portable shared in Dropbox)

I keep my emacs folder and my .emacs.d folder (which includes all my ELPA packages) in Dropbox, and symlink them into my home dir (I don't want my entire home dir in Dropbox). A couple of things worth mentioning:

If you use Emacs as a server (server-start) you will want to move server-auth-dir out of Dropbox, or make sure you have a custom server-name on each machine (system-name is convenient for setting this up), otherwise they'll all try to use the same file.

If there's anything you want to keep secret (.authinfo files, say, or org files containing your plans for the Death Star), keep them off Dropbox, or encrypt them using something like Easy PG. Dropbox has had security issues in the past.

If you add machines often, it's convenient to create a script that sets up your environment variables and does the symlinks for a new machine. Install Dropbox + wait + run script = Emacs!

My experience is mostly on Windows, and OS X. YMMV.

If you use DeskTop and you have multiple Emacsen running simultaneously, you might want to have each machine keep its own set of open files. One way to do that is <code>(setq desktop-base-file-name (concat ".desktop." (system-name)))</code>.

If you don't want to clutter up your Dropbox directory with auto-save files and backups while editing files in the Dropbox directory, you can add the following lines to your init file (or customize these variables to the same values) to save backup files outside of the Dropbox directory (in a temporary directory, or alternatively you might also want to save backups in your home directory when it's not under control of Dropbox):

    (add-to-list 'auto-save-file-name-transforms '("\\`.*/Dropbox/.*" "/tmp/" t))
    (add-to-list 'backup-directory-alist '("\\`.*/Dropbox/.*" . "/tmp/"))

If Emacs BackupFiles is set to make backups by renaming files, Dropbox will often prompt if the file being backed-up/renamed should be removed from Dropbox.  This can be worked around by setting `backup-by-copying' to `t'.
