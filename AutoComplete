== Development Version Notes ==
If you are using the current development version of AutoComplete (0.20 at the time of this edit) be aware that ac-source-semantic is now included in the package.  Furthermore, if you are using the semantic source,  make sure that you have required semantic-ia in your init file.  If you do not then it falls back to a method of gathering the tags that appears to not check the semantic cache slowing the whole thing up rather tremendously (especially with omnicompletion).

[I'm pretty sure this is horribly outdated! (current version 1.4)]
Speaking of omnicompletion, the way it functions was changed recently.  Since it is not documented yet here is an example of how it works:

{{{
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook '(lambda ()

          ;; ac-omni-completion-sources is made buffer local so
          ;; you need to add it to a mode hook to activate on 
          ;; whatever buffer you want to use it with.  This
          ;; example uses C mode (as you probably surmised).

          ;; auto-complete.el expects ac-omni-completion-sources to be
          ;; a list of cons cells where each cell's car is a regex
          ;; that describes the syntactical bits you want AutoComplete
          ;; to be aware of. The cdr of each cell is the source that will
          ;; supply the completion data.  The following tells autocomplete
          ;; to begin completion when you type in a . or a ->

          (add-to-list 'ac-omni-completion-sources
                       (cons "\\." '(ac-source-semantic)))
          (add-to-list 'ac-omni-completion-sources
                       (cons "->" '(ac-source-semantic)))

          ;; ac-sources was also made buffer local in new versions of
          ;; autocomplete.  In my case, I want AutoComplete to use 
          ;; semantic and yasnippet (order matters, if reversed snippets
          ;; will appear before semantic tag completions).

          (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-semantic ac-source-yasnippet))
  ))
}}}
Not terribly difficult but it took me a bit to puzzle out what needed to be done so I thought I would share my results.  [[AndyStewart]] has included the omnicompletion bits into his init file.

[new]

I'd like 'return' to trigger the completion.
I've been trying this:
(ac-set-trigger-key "RET") 

However, this stops 'return' from creating newlines.

[new]
Non lisp-hacker here. 
How can I add my own completions, and make auto-complete-mode start automatically for any opened file?
Thanks.

For the second part of the question here is what i currently use to bypass ac-modes list:
<pre>
;; dirty fix for having AC everywhere
(define-globalized-minor-mode real-global-auto-complete-mode
  auto-complete-mode (lambda ()
                       (if (not (minibufferp (current-buffer)))
                         (auto-complete-mode 1))

[new] How does this compare with CompletionUI and CompanyMode? --TobyCubitt

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-11 23:03 UTC]
: CompletionUI use tooltip as completion UI, AutoComplete and CompanyMode implement by Overlay.
: Tooltip just can use in X, and overlay can use both X and console.
: Tooltip is slower than overlay when finger is very fast. :)
: But overlay have align render bug with multi-byte language (such as CJK), and tooltip haven't this problem.
: About different between AutoComplete and CompanyMode, in fact they're very similar, but CompanyMode have more bug. -- AndyStewart

[new:dgutov:2012-12-25 19:41 UTC]
: CompanyMode is more feature-rich, actually. For example, as long as the source supports that, it can show a documentation or a definition buffer without quitting the completion interface.
: Try hitting `f1' or `C-w' when completing something in an EmacsLisp buffer.
: And it has a separate notion of metadata, which it shows in the echo area, that can be used to quickly show the function's argument list, for example.
: AutoComplete can display a candidate's documentation, but it uses third-party libraries for that. They can make it look cooler, but they impose certain limitations, like you can't add highlighting to the documentation text. -- DmitryGutov

[new]
Thanks for the explanation! CompletionUI includes many other user-interfaces besides the tooltip, implements an auto-completion-mode, and includes many other features besides. My aim was to make a swiss-army knife of completion user-interface code, so no one else would have to go through the same tedium! Would you be interested in adding your overlay display code to CompletionUI? --TobyCubitt

What about completion with candidates from other buffers? I've tried to add ac-source-words-in-all-buffer to ac-sources, but that didn't give any effect :(

hi, my enhancement of auto-complete, AutoCompletePlus, :) -- [[ahei]]

[new]
In c++-mode, ac-source-filename can not work, because 
<pre>
(defun ac-sources-prefix-default ()
  "Default implementation for `ac-sources-prefix-function'."
  (require 'thingatpt)
  (car-safe (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'symbol)))
</pre>
and thing-at-point is ahe when point after /home/ahe.
I think auto-complete should have multiple ac-prefix, and then complete those all. -- [[ahei]]

[new]
Can anyone explain how the ac-omni-completion-sources replacement works?  I am not understanding how to use this ac-prefix stuff.  I want to start completion on '.' and '->' for C programming, so foo-> would pop up completions for the struct Foo.  This was working in 0.20 and I'm just not seeing how to set this up again.

I'm getting the following error message:

Symbol's function definition is void: window-full-width-p

I googled this message, and found the following (at [http://braeburn.aquamacs.org/code/master/etc/NEWS.22]):


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 22.2.
.
.
.

** New function `window-full-width-p' returns t if a window is as wide
as its frame.

The manual states that GNU Emacs 22 or later is required, and the version I am using is GNU Emacs 22.1.1. Is my old version of emacs the source of the error, and if it is, should the manual be corrected to list a newer required version of emacs (at least 22.2)?

The gray-shaded inline expansion gets in the way when deleting characters in the midst of a line, as it overlays following existing text. This is a bit inconvenient. Is it possible to suppress completion while actively deleting?

----
[new]
Is it possible to use auto-complete to translate words with a lookup at dict.cc leo.org? 

[new]
Yes, of course. auto-complete is a frame work for completion. But you have to give it the sources to complete from and take care of the output from completion.
(You could of course use Emacs default completion frame work too. Or Icicles etc.)

BUG: Entering two forward slashes (for example to add a comment in C++) causes a delay of several minutes during which one can do nothing else with emacs.

Comment: I tried this with auto-complete 1.3.1 and don't witness the issue.  The first time I type // there's a noticible delay of less than a second.

[new]
I am seeing this same issue.  I am using auto-complete 1.3.1, emacs 24.3.1 (i686-pc-cygwin) on Windows 7 x64.  Typing the first forward slash gives me an auto-complete suggestion of "/bin". Typing the second forward slash make emacs unresponsive for around 30 seconds.  Interestingly, Windows does not report the program as "not responding" during this time, even though everything from text entry to cursor movement to drop-down menu items is completely frozen.

How can I prevent this without disabling auto-complete in every other mode? --IanL

Hey, if you want to stop having an autocomplete prompt when you hit RET, edit your auto-complete-config.el file and add the semicolon to the prefix regex. You should have something like that:

(defun ac-css-prefix ()
  (when (save-excursion (re-search-backward "\\_<\\(.+?\\)\\_>\\s *:.*\\=\\;" nil t))
    (setq ac-css-property (match-string 1))

Blog article for it: [http://bamanzi.is-programmer.com/posts/24558]  (Sorry that it was written in Chinese. I'll wrote some English description some time later. Or you can read the comment in source :-))

Is it possible to add some additional information in the popup menus that doesn't get inserted when the text is completed? I would like to have the additional type information semantic provides for C/C++ code in the popup menuÃ£ÂÂlike

| l : long[] |
| x : int    |.

I couldn't find the place to post a bug report, so I'll leave it here. As of Emacs 24.3.50.1 and auto-complete 1.4 the variable `ac-auto-start' is mysteriously set to `nil' regardless of any configuration value. It is set right after calling `auto-complete-mode' and cannot be reset afterwards. Most likely some timer resets it to nil. However, it is not `ac-clear-variables-every-minute', that happens much later.

...Since I installed auto-complete I just can't exit emacs as it freezes with 'Wrote ~/.emacs.d/ac-comphist.d'.
Any ideas? I have this plugins installed: evil, evil-nerd-commenter, undo-tree, smooth-scrolling, color-theme

Try... (setq ac-use-comphist nil). This option makes emacs to exit slowly... -- Kiwon

[FAQ]

How does it work ? What does it get assigned to any keys ? Which function should I assign to get auto-completion ?

If you have a black background use auto-complete, the cursor turns black. This obscures the text and can be fixed by 
adding (set-cursor-color "white") to your .emacs file after loading the auto-complete package.
