= Use with MailCrypt =

To use GnuPG with MailCrypt you should

<pre>
(mc-setversion "gpg")
(setq mc-gpg-user-id "user@foo.dom")
</pre>

This is all the customization I've done to MailCrypt to make it work with GnuPG.


I have been having trouble getting MailCrypt to work on windows, 
and I didn't want to depend on cygwin's sh.exe, 
so I wrote an independent gpg mode that only requires
a working gpg setup: Lisp:dgpg.el    -- DavidElentok

= Updating ELPA Certs on Windows =

I've added the following to my startup scripts to support PGP under Windows 10 (for more information on !GnuPG, see [https://www.gpg4win.org/ GPG4WIN] or [https://www.gnupg.org the GnuPG Offical Site]:
<pre>
;; windows/dos GNUPG setup
(if (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
    (custom-set-variables
     '(epg-gpg-home-directory "C:/GnuPG")
     '(epg-gpg-program (concat epg-gpg-home-directory "/bin/gpg.exe"))
     '(epg-gpgconf-program  (concat epg-gpg-home-directory "/bin/gpgconf.exe"))))
</pre>

This is especially handy for getting [[use-package]] ##:ensure## to behave when updating the ELPA PGP signatures on a machine with expired ELPA PGP signatures:

<pre>
(let ((my/old package-check-signature))
  (use-package gnu-elpa-keyring-update
    :ensure t
    :init   (setq package-check-signature nil)
    :config (setq package-check-signature my/old)))
</pre>

Note, the ##let## here allows us to update signatures when our present ones are expired already.
