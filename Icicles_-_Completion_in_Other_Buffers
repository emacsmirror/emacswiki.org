== Completion in Other Buffers ==

In addition to input [[completion]], you can use '''Icicles''' to complete
words and [[symbol]]s in other [[buffer]]s, besides the [[minibuffer]].
'''Icicles''' enhances this completion in these ways:

# ''Lisp symbol'' completion via '''`M-TAB'''' (`lisp-complete-symbol').  (This is also `ESC-TAB' and `C-M-i'.)

# Word completion using the ''dynamic abbreviation'' of standard
Emacs library '''##dabbrev.el##''', via '''`##C-M-/##''''.

# Word completion using the '''`dynamic-completion-mode'''' of standard
Emacs library '''##completion.el##''', via '''`C-RET'''' or '''`M-RET''''.

# Word completion using the words and phrases in a ''thesaurus'', via
'''`##C-c /##'''' (requires library <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt> -- see [[Synonyms]]).

# Mailing-information completion for [[BbdbMode|BBDB]] (Insidious Big Brother Database).

# '''`TAB'''' completion of the following in ShellMode and [[EmacsSpeaksStatistics|ESS]] modes (and other, similar interpreters):
## Commands
## Previous inputs -- commands plus their arguments
## File names
## Environment variables

Whenever multiple completion candidates are available, you can use '''Icicles'''
completion, with all of its features: [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] of candidates (`TAB', `down', or `next'), [[apropos completion|apropos]]
([[regexp]]) completion (`S-TAB'), [[progressive completion]] (`S-SPC'), help on individual candidates (`C-M-RET'), and so on.









[:DynamicAbbreviation]
[:DynamicCompletionUsingDabbrevEL]
=== Dynamic Completion Using `dabbrev.el' ===

Library ##dabbrev.el## lets you type a few characters
in a buffer and then prefix-complete them (in the same buffer) to a full word or symbol name.
The completion candidates come from words or symbol names in
buffers that you are editing.  This functionality is called
"dynamic abbreviation", though "'''dynamic completion'''" would be a better term for it (words are ''completed'', not abbreviated,
dynamically).

Library ##dabbrev.el## provides two ways to dynamically complete text:

* `M-/' (command `dabbrev-expand') completes to a candidate word.
Repeating it replaces the completion with a different one -- that is, it ''cycles candidates'' in the text buffer (not in the
minibuffer).

* `M-C-/' (command `dabbrev-completion') completes to the common 
prefix of all matching completion candidates.  Repeating it displays
buffer `*Completions*' for you to choose a candidate.  However,
in this case, there is ''no way to cycle'' among the candidates.

If there are many candidate completions then cycling among them
with `M-/' can be tedious.  You can use `M-C-/' to complete to a
common prefix, thus narrowing the set of candidates, but then you
lose the ability to cycle among them.

If [[user option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>'''' contains an entry for `dabbrev-completion' then '''Icicles''' remaps keys normally bound
to command `dabbrev-completion' to command
'''`icicle-dabbrev-completion'''', which
uses '''Icicles''' completion whenever there are multiple completion candidates.  You can then use any '''Icicles''' features, such
as apropos completion and candidate cycling.   In addition, you can complete an ''empty'' prefix, starting from scratch with apropos completion.









[:DynamicCompletionUsingCompletionEL]
=== Dynamic Completion Using `completion.el' ===

Standard Emacs library ##completion.el# is quite old and little known nowadays.
It is nevertheless very useful.  In a way, it is like ##dabbrev.el##
on steroids.  It is pretty smart, proposing first the completions
that you have used most recently.  You can use it anywhere, to
complete all kinds of buffer text.

The command for completing the text before point is '''`complete'''' (an
unfortunately general name, as is the name of the library), which
is bound globally to '''`C-RET'''' and '''`M-RET'''' when you are in
'''`dynamic-completion-mode''''.

Command `complete' can act similar to the `dabbrev' commands, in which
case it is said to be using method `cdabbrev' (but this name is
not defined in any way programmatically; it is referred to
informally).

But the `dabbrev'-like behavior of `complete' is only a fallback,
when its normal completion method comes up empty-handed.  The
normal method matches what you type against a persistent personal
"database" of completions, which is constructed and updated
automatically as you type.  (It is saved only on demand or when
you exit Emacs.)

To make good use of this library, you really should read the
complete Commentary in the `completion.el' source code (keeping in
mind that in a few places it is not up to date).  But the doc
string of command `icicle-complete' (which is the version of
`complete' used in Icicle mode) is a good place to start.

To make this kind of completion available, you must turn on
`dynamic-completion-mode'.

Here is the beginning of the ##completion.el## Commentary:

  This watches all the words that you type and remembers them.
  When typing a new word, pressing "complete" (meta-return)
  "completes" the word by inserting the most recently used word
  that begins with the same characters.  If you press meta-return
  repeatedly, it cycles through all the words it knows about.

  If you like the completion then just continue typing, it is as
  if you entered the text by hand.  If you want the inserted extra
  characters to go away, type control-w or delete.  More options
  are described below.

  The guesses are made in the order of the most recently "used".
  Typing in a word and then typing a separator character (such as
  a space) "uses" the word.  So does moving a cursor over the
  word.  If no words are found, it uses an extended version of the
  `dabbrev'-style completion.

  You automatically save the completions you use to a file between
  sessions.

  Completion enables programmers to enter longer, more descriptive
  variable names while typing fewer keystrokes than they normally
  would.

Just as for the `dabbrev' commands, '''Icicles''' enhances this
completion by letting you use '''Icicles''' minibuffer completion when
there are multiple candidates.  This happens only if one of these
is true:

* The number of candidates is greater than the value of [[option]]
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-cmpl-max-candidates-to-cycle|icicle-cmpl-max-candidates-to-cycle]]</tt>''''.

* There are at least two candidates and you explicitly request
  '''Icicles''' completion by using two or more plain [[prefix argument|prefix args]] (`C-u C-u').

What about that fallback completion method, `cdabbrev'?  Vanilla
`complete' uses it only if no matching completions are found in
the database.  (It is generally slower than database lookup.)

'''Icicles''' lets you choose whether to match only database completions
or also terms found in your current Emacs windows (`cdabbrev'), by
customizing option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-cmpl-include-cdabbrev-flag|icicle-cmpl-include-cdabbrev-flag]]</tt>''''.  (You can
toggle the value anytime using `M-x icicle-toggle-option'.)

If the option value is non-`nil' then whenever '''Icicles''' completion
is used the candidates include the completions found dynamically
by searching your current windows.  If it is `nil' then only
database completions are candidates.  The dynamically found
candidates are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' using [[face]]
`icicle-special-candidate', so you can easily distinguish them.









[:ThesaurusCompletion]
=== Thesaurus Lookup and Completion ===

Library '''<tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>''' provides various features for defining a
thesaurus and looking up words and phrases in it.  '''Icicles'''
provides a [[multi-command]] version (alias `icicle-synonyms') of the
command '''`synonyms'''', which shows all of the synonyms that match a
regular expression (e.g. a word or phrase) and lets you navigate
among hyperlinked thesaurus entries.

Command '''`icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry'''' completes a word in a text buffer to
any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  With the default value of
option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>'''', this is bound to '''`##C-c /##'''' in ''Icicle'' mode.

'''''Tip:''''' You can use `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' to quickly check the ''spelling'' of a word. If it is correctly spelled, then it appears as a complete completion (is highlighted as such in the minibuffer).

Another '''Icicles''' (multi-)command that uses the thesaurus is
'''`icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry''''.  It lets you use '''Icicles'''
completion, cycling, and so on to insert thesaurus words and
phrases in any buffer.  It does not complete the word at point.  Within a single call to it, insert any number of
thesaurus entries, in succession.  If you wanted to, you could write an entire
book using a single call to `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!

All of these commands require that you load
library <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>. 

See '''[[Synonyms]]''' for more information on the features of library <tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt>.







[:bbdb-complete-mail]
[:bbdb-complete-name]
[:BbdbCompletion]
=== BBDB Completion ===

Library ##bbdb.el## is a rolodex-like database program for GNU Emacs -- see BbdbMode.  
You can obtain a recent version, such as 3.02 or later, from
http://melpa.milkbox.net/, or you can pick up an older version,
such as 2.35, from http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/.

If user option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-functions-to-redefine|icicle-functions-to-redefine]]</tt>'''' contains an entry for `bbdb-complete-mail' (for BBDB version 3.02) or `bbdb-complete-name' (for BBDB version 2.35),
then '''Icicles''' redefines that command so that it uses '''Icicles''' completion when there
are multiple completions.

You can use any '''Icicles''' features, such
as apropos completion and candidate cycling.  For this feature to
take effect, you must load BBDB before you load '''Icicles'''.   By default, option `icicle-functions-to-redefine'
includes an entry for `bbdb-complete-mail' (not for
`bbdb-complete-name').








[:ShellCommandCompletion]
=== Completion in Comint Modes ===

`TAB' in a shell or similar buffer provides '''Icicles''' completion for command names, file names, and environment variables that are known to the
shell (or other interpreter). Starting with Emacs 23, '''Icicles''' completion is available also when you use '''`##M-!##'''' (`shell-command') or '''`##M-|##'''' (`shell-command-on-region').

In a shell or similar buffer you can also complete input using your previous inputs as the set of candidates. Just type something at the prompt, hit '''`##C-c `##'''', and pick one or more previous inputs to execute again (this uses `icicle-search', so it is a [[multi-command]]).  You need not re-execute the exact same shell command; you can edit your previous input before hitting `RET' to enter the command.

These features are available for ComintMode and several modes
that inherit from it, including ShellMode, Shell Script mode (ShMode),
various ESS modes (EmacsSpeaksStatistics), InferiorEmacsLispMode (IELM), GrandUnifiedDebugger (GUD) mode, TclMode, RloginMode, and NS Lookup mode.
