Could there please be a link to this page from page Administration?  Thx -- DrewAdams

You say this:

: Next, consider what just happened:

: If spammers added links, you will be presented with a list of these URLs and a text input field where you can provide a regular expression matching anything obvious such as “viagra”. Click on the Ban! button to add this regular expression to the BannedContent page.

: If vandals made other changes to the page, you might have to ban their host name or IP number. Click on the Ban contributors link and click the appropriate Ban! button. This will add an appropriate regular expression to the BannedHosts page.

I don't see any such Ban! links/buttons.  I see no change.  After I rollback, where do I find such links?

This is what it would look if you had the default theme and used a German locale:

Until a few minutes ago it didn't work because there was an illegal regular expression in our BannedContent which caused the script to crash before it could print the list of URLs… I need to make this code more robust. :)

OK, I'll look for it.  But where and at what point should I expect to see that (in English)?

You should see this once you roll back some link spam.

OK, now it is there.  I clicked it. Then I saw a page entitled "Ban Contributors to KeyboardMacros" and which lists myself (twice, 2 different IPs) and ChrisLeyon.  Any way we can filter those out, so we don't accidentally end up banning administrators?  Or perhaps make clicking the `Ban!' button for an administrator be a no-op?

Also, I repeat the request to place a like to this page (EmacsWikiAdministrators) on the [[Administration]] page.  It's not so easy to find this page.  Thx.

I've added EmacsWikiAdministrators to the _Administration_ page.

The script itself doesn't have a list of known administrators which I could stop from getting banned. Whoever has the password is an administrator. Usernames are irrelevant. Then again, bans on administrators have no effect. Thus: If somebody were to ban you, and you visited the wiki, you'd be banned from editing the site unless you had the administrator set. With administrator password, the ban has no effect. This would allow you to undo any such self-banning mistakes easily. I don't think we have a problem, there.

I can no longer find the BannedHosts link on the Administration page.  Does it have some other name there now?

No, that was a bug. It should be fixed, now.
