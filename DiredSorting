You can change the way vanilla DiredMode sorts files either by:

* `s' to toggle between alphabetical and date order and with prefix argument, edit listing switches
* customizing the variable `dired-listing-switches'
* customizing per-directory local variables.

For a list of listing options, see ls manual.

= Sort Directories First =
You can accomplish this by customizing variable `dired-listing-switches' to include `--group-directories-first'. For example:

<pre>
(setq dired-listing-switches "-aBhl  --group-directories-first")
</pre>

See DiredSortDirectoriesFirst for other solutions.
