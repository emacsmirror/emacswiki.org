I feel like https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python should get mentioned on this page, it's a shortcut method of setting up a lot of things mentioned

Thanks for collecting all this information! But it would be nice to have more information to help select among the various packages. What does Jedi do that eglot doesn't, and vice versa? Are they widely used and actively maintained? You mention that many of the "support features" are already provided by some of the IDEs. Which ones provide added value?

Thanks again!

Thanks macrakis for the helpful comments.  I've taken a step in this direction by providing some advice on choosing a setup; the page avoided favoring specific packages/approaches before, but given "where to start" is a common question some guidance makes sense.  For the IDE/Support features/added value issue, I am thinking of putting in a table something like IDES (or packages) by Features as maybe a useful way to present this.
