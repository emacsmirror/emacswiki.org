;;  Documentation
;;  -------------
;;
;;  Library `zones.el' lets you easily define and subsequently act on
;;  multiple zones of buffer text.  You can think of this as enlarging
;;  the notion of "region".  In effect, it can remove the requirement
;;  of target text being a contiguous sequence of characters.  A set
;;  of buffer zones is, in effect, a (typically) noncontiguous
;;  "region" of text.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Compatibility")
;;  ** Compatibility **
;;
;;  Some of the functions defined here are not available for Emacs
;;  versions prior to 23.  Still others are available only starting
;;  with Emacs 25.  This is mentioned where applicable.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Zones")
;;  ** Zones **
;;
;;  A "zone" is a basic zone or an izone.  A zone represents the text
;;  between its two positions, just as an Emacs region is the text
;;  between point and mark.
;;
;;  A "basic zone" is a list of two buffer positions followed by a
;;  possibly empty list of extra information: (POS1 POS2 . EXTRA).
;;
;;  An "izone" is a list whose first element is an identifier, ID,
;;  which is a negative integer (-1, -2, -3,...), and whose cdr is a
;;  basic zone.  So an izone has the form (ID POS1 POS2 . EXTRA).
;;
;;  The ID is negative just to distinguish a basic zone whose EXTRA
;;  list starts with an integer from an izone.  Interactively (e.g. in
;;  prompts), references to the ID typically leave off the minus sign.
;;
;;  The positions of a zone can be positive integers (1, 2, 3,...),
;;  markers for the same buffer, or readable markers for the same
;;  buffer.  (Behavior is undefined if a single zone has markers for
;;  different buffers.)  Each position of a given zone can take any of
;;  these forms.
;;
;;  A "readable marker" is a list (marker BUFFER POSITION), where
;;  BUFFER is a buffer name (string) and where POSITION is a buffer
;;  position (as an integer, not as a marker).
;;
;;  The content of a zone is any contiguous stretch of buffer text.
;;  The positions of a zone can be in either numeric order.  The
;;  positions are also called the zone "limits".  The lower limit is
;;  called the zone "beginning"; the upper limit is called its "end".
;;
;;
;;(@* "Coalesced (United) Zones")
;;  ** Coalesced (United) Zones **
;;
;;  A list of zones can include zones that overlap or are adjacent
;;  (the end of one is one less than the beginning of the other).
;;
;;  Basic-zone union and intersection operations (`zz-zone-union',
;;  `zz-zone-intersection') each act on a list of zones, returning
;;  another such list, but with the recorded positions for each zone
;;  in (ascending) buffer order, and with the zones in ascending order
;;  of their cars.  For basic-zone union, the resulting zones are said
;;  to be "coalesced", or "united".
;;
;;  The extra info in the zones that result from zone union or
;;  intersection is just the set union or set intersection of the
;;  extra info in the zones that are combined.
;;
;;  After a list of zones has been altered by `zz-zone-union' or
;;  `zz-zone-intersection':
;;
;;  * Each zone in the result list is ordered so that its first
;;    element is smaller than its second.
;;
;;  * The zones in the result list have been sorted in ascending order
;;    by their first elements.
;;
;;  * The zones in the result list are disjoint: they are not adjacent
;;    and do not overlap: there is some other buffer text (i.e., not
;;    in any zone) between any two zones in the result.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Noncontiguous Region and Set of Zones")
;;  ** Noncontiguous Region and Set of Zones **
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 25, Emacs can sometimes use a region that is
;;  made up of noncontiguous pieces of buffer content: a
;;  "noncontiguous region".  This is similar to a set of zones, but
;;  there are some differences.
;;
;;  The zones in a set (or list) of zones can be adjacent or overlap,
;;  and their order in the set is typically not important.
;;
;;  A noncontiguous region corresponds instead to what results from
;;  coalescing (uniting) a set of zones: a sequence of disjoint zones,
;;  in buffer order, that is, ordered by their cars.
;;
;;  The Lisp representation of a zone also differs from that of a
;;  segment of a noncontiguous region.  Each records two buffer
;;  positions, but a zone can also include a list of additional
;;  information (whatever you like).
;;
;;  A noncontiguous-region segment is a cons (BEGIN . END), with BEGIN
;;  <= END.  A zone is a list (LIMIT1 LIMIT2 . EXTRA) of two positions
;;  optionally followed by a list of extra stuff (any Lisp objects).
;;  And as stated above, the zone limits need not be in ascending
;;  order.
;;
;;  The last difference is that each buffer position of a zone can be
;;  a marker, which means that a list of zones can specify zones in
;;  different buffers.  A zone position can also be a readable marker,
;;  which is a Lisp sexp that can be written to disk (e.g., as part of
;;  a bookmark or saved variable), and restored in a later Emacs
;;  session by reading the file where it is saved.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Zones and Overlays")
;;  ** Zones and Overlays **
;;
;;  Zones have even more in common with Emacs overlays than they do
;;  with segments of a noncontiguous region.  An overlay has an
;;  associated buffer, two limits (start and end), and an optional
;;  list of properties.
;;
;;  Zones differ from overlays in these ways:
;;
;;  * A zone can have an identifier (izone).
;;  * A zone can have a readable Lisp form, by using numbers or
;;    readable markers.
;;  * A zone need not be specific to a particular buffer.  If a zone's
;;    positions are numbers instead of markers then you can use it in
;;    any buffer.
;;  * A set of zones can be persistent, by bookmarking it.
;;
;;  You can create zones from overlays, and vice versa, using
;;  functions `zz-overlay-to-zone', `zz-zone-to-overlay',
;;  `zz-overlays-to-zones', and `zz-zones-to-overlays'.
;;
;;  When creating zones from overlays you can specify how to represent
;;  the zone limits: using markers, readable markers, or positive
;;  integers.  And you can specify whether to create basic zones or
;;  izones.
;;
;;  The resulting zone has ((:zz-overlay . PROPS)) as its list of
;;  extra information, where PROPS is the overlay's property list.  So
;;  the zone is (LIMIT1 LIMIT2 (:zz-overlay . PROPS)) (or the same
;;  with an identifier, if an izone).
;;
;;  When creating overlays from zones, the presence of a list
;;  (:zz-overlay . PROPS) in the extra zone information results in the
;;  overlay having PROPS as its property list.  When creating a single
;;  such overlay you can optionally specify additional overlay
;;  properties, as well as arguments FRONT-ADVANCE and REAR-ADVANCE
;;  for function `make-overlay'.
;;
;;  You can use function `zz-overlay-union' to coalesce overlays in a
;;  given buffer that overlap or are adjacent.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Izone Commands")
;;  ** Izone Commands **
;;
;;  Commands that manipulate lists of zones generally use izones,
;;  because they make use of the zone identifiers.
;;
;;  Things you can do with zones:
;;
;;  * Sort them.
;;
;;  * Unite (coalesce) adjacent or overlapping zones (which includes
;;    sorting them in ascending order of their cars).
;;
;;  * Intersect them.
;;
;;  * Narrow the buffer to any of them.  Cycle among narrowings.  If
;;    you use library `icicles.el' then you can also navigate among
;;    them in any order, and using completion against BEG-END range
;;    names.
;;
;;  * Select any of them as the active region.  Cycle among them.
;;
;;  * Search them (they are automatically coalesced first).  For this
;;    you need library `isearch-prop.el'.
;;
;;  * Make a set of zones or its complement (the anti-zones)
;;    invisible.  For this you also need library `isearch-prop.el'.
;;
;;  * Highlight and unhighlight them.  For this you need library
;;    `highlight.el' or library `facemenu+.el' (different kinds of
;;    highlighting).
;;
;;  * Add zones of highlighted text (overlay or text-property
;;    highlighting).  For this you need library `highlight.el'.
;;    (You can highlight many ways, including dragging the mouse.)
;;
;;  * Add the active region to a list of zones.
;;
;;  * Add the active region to a list of zones, and then unite
;;    (coalesce) the zones.
;;
;;  * Delete an izone from a list of zones.
;;
;;  * Clone a zones variable to another one, so the clone has the same
;;    zones.
;;
;;  * Clone a zones variable and then unite the zones of the clone.
;;
;;  * Make an izone variable persistent, in a bookmark.  Use the
;;    bookmark to restore it in a subsequent Emacs session.  For this
;;    you need library `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;  * Query-replace over them (Emacs 25 and later).
;;
;;
;;(@* "Izone List Variables")
;;  ** Izone List Variables **
;;
;;  Commands that use izones generally use a variable that holds a
;;  list of them.  By default, this is the buffer-local variable
;;  `zz-izones'.  But such a variable can be buffer-local or global.
;;  If it is global then it can use markers and readable markers for
;;  different buffers.
;;
;;  The value of variable `zz-izones-var' is the variable currently
;;  being used by default for izone commands.  The default value is
;;  `zz-izones'.
;;
;;  You can have any number of izones variables, and they can be
;;  buffer-local or global variables.
;;
;;  You can use `C-x n v' (command `zz-set-izones-var') anytime to set
;;  `zz-izones-var' to a variable whose name you enter.  With a prefix
;;  argument, the variable is made automatically buffer-local.  Use
;;  `C-x n v' to switch among various zone variables for the current
;;  buffer (if buffer-local) or globally.
;;
;;  Sometimes another zone command prompts you for the izones variable
;;  to use, if you give it a prefix argument.  The particular prefix
;;  arg determines whether the variable, if not yet bound, is made
;;  buffer-local, and whether `zz-izones-var' is set to the variable
;;  symbol:
;;
;;   prefix arg         buffer-local   set `zz-izones-var'
;;   ----------         ------------   -------------------
;;   Plain `C-u'        yes            yes
;;   > 0 (e.g. `C-1')   yes            no
;;   = 0 (e.g. `C-0')   no             yes
;;   < 0 (e.g. `C--')   no             no
;;
;;  For example, `C-u C-x n a' (`zz-add-zone') prompts you for a
;;  different variable to use, in place of the current value of
;;  `zz-izones-var'.  The variable you enter is made buffer-local and
;;  it becomes the new default izones variable for the buffer; that
;;  is, `zz-izones-var' is set to the variable symbol.
;;
;;  As another example, suppose that `zz-izones-var' is `zz-izones',
;;  the default value and buffer-local by design.  If you then use
;;  `C-- C-x n a' and enter a variable name at the prompt, that
;;  variable is not made buffer-local, and `zz-izones-var' is not set
;;  to that variable.  The active region is pushed to the variable,
;;  but because `zz-izones-var' is unchanged, a subsequent `C-x n a'
;;  (no prefix arg) pushes to `zz-izones'.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Keys")
;;  ** Keys **
;;
;;  Many of the commands that manipulate izones are bound on keymap
;;  `narrow-map'.  So they are available on prefix key `C-x n' (by
;;  default), along with the narrowing/widening keys `C-x n d', `C-x n
;;  n', `C-x n p', and `C-x n w'.  (If you use Emacs 22 then there is
;;  no `narrow-map', so the same `n ...' keys are bound on keymap
;;  `ctl-x-map'.)
;;
;;  If you have already bound one of these keys then `zones.el' does
;;  not rebind that key; your bindings are respected.
;;

;;  `C-x n C-s', 'C-x n C-M-s`.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Command `zz-narrow-repeat'")
;;  ** Command `zz-narrow-repeat' **
;;
;;  Library `zones.el' modifies commands `narrow-to-region',
;;  `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' (`C-x n n', `C-x n d', and
;;  `C-x n p') so that the current buffer restriction (narrowing) is
;;  added to the izone list of the current buffer (by default,
;;  buffer-local variable `zz-izones').
;;
;;  You can then use `C-x n x' to cycle or pop previous narrowings.
;;  Repeating `x' repeats the action: `C-x n x x x x' etc.  Each time
;;  you hit `x' a different narrowing is made current.  This gives you
;;  an easy way to browse your past narrowings.
;;
;;  If the izone variable is not buffer-local then `zz-narrow-repeat'
;;  can cycle among the narrowings in different buffers, switching the
;;  buffer accordingly.
;;
;;  Invoking `C-x n x' with a prefix argument changes the behavior
;;  as follows:
;;
;;  * A plain prefix arg (`C-u') widens the buffer completely.
;;
;;  * A zero numeric prefix arg (e.g `C-0') widens completely and
;;    resets (empties) the current izone variable.
;;
;;  * A numeric prefix arg N takes you directly to the abs(N)th
;;    previous buffer narrowing.  That is, it acts abs(N) times.
;;
;;  A negative arg work like a positive one, except that it also pops
;;  entries off the ring: it removes entries from the most recent back
;;  through the (-)Nth one.  For example, `C-- C-x n x x x' pops the
;;  last added narrowing each time you hit `x'.  You can thus use the
;;  list of recorded zones as a narrowing stack: narrow commands push
;;  to the stack, and `C-- C-x n x' pops it.
;;
;;  By default, `C-x n x' is bound to command `zz-narrow-repeat'.
;;  (For Emacs versions prior to 22 it is bound by default to
;;  `zz-narrow', which is a non-repeatable version.  Repeatability is

;;
;;  The mode-line lighter `Narrow' is still used for the ordinary
;;  Emacs narrowing commands.  But for `zz-narrow-repeat' (`C-x n x')
;;  the current narrowing is indicated in the lighter by an
;;  identifying number: `Narrow-1', `Narrow-2', and so on.  `mouse-2'
;;  on the `Narrow' part still widens completely, but `mouse-2' on the
;;  `-NUM' part uses `zz-narrow-repeat' to cycle to the next
;;  narrowing.
;;
;;  If option `zz-narrowing-use-fringe-flag' is non-nil then the face
;;  of the selected frame's fringe is set to `zz-fringe-for-narrowing'
;;  whenever the buffer is narrowed.  This shows you that the current
;;  buffer is narrowed even if the mode-line does not.

;;(@* "Define Your Own Commands")
;;  ** Define Your Own Commands **
;;
;;  Pretty much anything you can do with the Emacs region you can do
;;  with a set of zones (i.e., with a non-contiguous "region").  But
;;  existing Emacs commands that act on the region do not know about
;;  non-contiguous regions.  What you will need to do is define new
;;  commands that take these into account.
;;
;;  You can define your own commands that iterate over a list of
;;  izones in a given buffer, or over such lists in a set of buffers.
;;  Utility functions `zz-basic-zones', `zz-basic-zones-in-bufs', and
;;  `zz-read-bufs', `zz-do-zones', `zz-do-izones', `zz-map-zones', and
;;  `zz-map-izones' can help with this.
;;
;;  As examples of such commands, if you use library `highlight.el'
;;  then you can use `C-x n h' (command `hlt-highlight-regions') to
;;  highlight the izones recorded for the current buffer.  You can use
;;  `C-x n H' (command `hlt-highlight-regions-in-buffers') to do the
;;  same across a set of buffers that you specify (or across all
;;  visible buffers).  If option `hlt-auto-faces-flag' is non-nil then
;;  each zone gets a different face.  Otherwise, all of the zones are
;;  highlighted with the same face.  Complementary (unbound) commands
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-regions' and `hlt-unhighlight-regions-in-buffers'
;;  unhighlight.
;;
;;  Defining your own command can be simple or somewhat complex,
;;  depending on how the region is used in the code for the
;;  corresponding region-action Emacs command.  The definition of
;;  `hlt-highlight-regions' just calls existing function
;;  `hlt-highlight-region' once for each recorded zone:
;;
;; (defun hlt-highlight-regions (&optional regions face msgp mousep
;;                                         buffers)
;;   "Apply `hlt-highlight-region' to regions in `zz-izones'."
;;   (interactive (list (zz-basic-zones zz-izones)
;;                      nil
;;                      t
;;                      current-prefix-arg))
;;   (dolist (start+end  regions)
;;     (hlt-highlight-region (nth 0 start+end) (nth 1 start+end)
;;                           face msgp mousep buffers)))
;;
;;  That's it - just iterate over `zz-izones' with a function that
;;  takes a zone as an argument.  What `zones.el' offers in this
;;  regard is a way to easily define a set of buffer zones.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Automatically Create Zones on Region Deactivation")
;;  ** Automatically Create Zones on Region Deactivation **
;;
;;  Minor mode `zz-auto-add-region-as-izone-mode' automatically adds
;;  the nonempty region as an izone upon its deactivation.  The zone
;;  is added to the current value of `zz-izones-var'.
