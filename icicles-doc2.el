;;  Icicles documentation, part 2.
;;
;;  Files `icicles-doc1.el' and `icicles-doc2.el' contain the doc for
;;  Icicles, including how to install and use Icicles.  You can also
;;  read the Icicles doc, in formatted form, on the Emacs-Wiki Web
;;  site: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles.  Emacs Wiki also
;;  has a few addtional pages about Icicles.  In particular, if you
;;  are new to Emacs, as well as Icicles, see this page:
;;  https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles.
;;
;;  This file continues the Icicles documentation, which starts in
;;  file `icicles-doc1.el'.

;;
;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections of this doc.  Linkd mode will
;;  highlight this Index and render it more readable.  Likewise, for
;;  the cross-references and section headings throughout this file.
;;  You can get `linkd.el' here:

;;(@* "Introduction: On Beyond Occur...")
;;  ** Introduction: On Beyond Occur... **
;;
;;  You've no doubt used standard Emacs command `occur'.  It finds all
;;  lines in a buffer that match a regexp that you enter.  It displays
;;  the matching lines as links in buffer `*Occur*' - you can click a
;;  link to navigate to the corresponding line in the original buffer.
;;  Using buffer `*Occur*' is similar to using the output of the Emacs
;;  `grep' command.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-occur' is similar to `occur', but instead of
;;  entering a regexp (with `RET') you type a regexp and then use
;;  `S-TAB' to show the matching lines in buffer `*Completions*'.  As
;;  usual in Icicles, you can complete to a single candidate, or cycle
;;  among candidates to choose one.  To navigate to a match in the
;;  original buffer, use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', or `C-prior'.
;;  One advantage of `icicle-occur' over `occur' is that you can
;;  change the regexp on the fly to match different sets of lines.
;;
;;  Another, major advantage is that you can use progressive
;;  completion to find lines that match multiple regexps.  A similar,
;;  but less interactive, effect can be had using chained `grep'
;;  commands, but it is otherwise not possible with other search
;;  methods such as regexp Isearch.  A regexp simply cannot express
;;  intersection ("and") except in the limited form of "followed by".
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is a generalization of `icicle-occur'.
;;  You enter an initial, search-context regexp (using `RET'), which
;;  defines a set of completion candidates: all of the matching
;;  strings in the current buffer (by default).  These candidates are
;;  called "search contexts".
;;
;;  Command `icicle-occur' is really `icicle-search' with an implicit
;;  initial regexp of `.*' (which you do not enter, however).  For
;;  `icicle-occur', the search contexts, that is, the initial
;;  completion candidates, are all of the lines of the buffer (`.'
;;  matches any character except a newline).
;;
;;  This means that `icicle-occur' does not, like `grep' and `occur',
;;  give you just one chance to filter the lines by providing a regexp
;;  to match.  It lets you dynamically change the filtering regexp,
;;  changing the search hits on the fly.  That is the general idea of
;;  Icicles search: define search contexts, then filter them
;;  dynamically by matching your current minibuffer input.
;;
;;  What if you want to start out with only a subset of the buffer
;;  lines, and then match those dynamically - in other words, you are
;;  sure you want to limit your searching to only some of the lines?
;;  In that case, you just use `icicle-search', not `icicle-occur',
;;  providing it with a context-defining regexp that matches only the
;;  lines you want.
;;
;;  For example, you might use `.*for.*', to start with only the lines
;;  containing `for' as the contexts to search.  Again, `icicle-occur'
;;  is just a shortcut version of `icicle-search' for the common case
;;  where you want to dynamically match any of the lines.
;;
;;  More generally, with `icicle-search' the candidates need not be
;;  single, complete lines; they can be any strings in the buffer,
;;  including multi-line strings.  Your initial regexp is used over
;;  and over to find the set of matching strings in the region or
;;  buffer that you search.  These strings then serve as the
;;  completion candidates.
;;
;;  For example, you might use a search-context regexp of
;;  "[A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!]" to search sentences, "\\(.+\n\\)+" to search
;;  paragraphs, or "\\([^\f]*[\f]\\|[^\f]+$\\)" to search pages.
;;  (That's in fact how convenience commands
;;  `icicles-search-sentences', `icicles-search-paragraphs', and
;;  `icicles-search-pages' are defined.)
;;
;;  `\f' is the form-feed, or page-separator, character.  You input
;;  `\f', `\t', and `\n' using `C-q l', `C-q TAB', and `C-j',
;;  respectively.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Dot, Dot, Dot")
;;  for information about multi-line dot (`.'), which matches also
;;  newline.
;;
;;  Again, you can use progressive completion (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to
;;  match several different regexps within the same page or the same
;;  sentence.  For example, you could find all sentences that contain
;;  `character', `delete', and `backward', in any order, as follows:
;;
;;    C-c ` [A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!] RET
;;    character S-SPC delete S-SPC backward
;;
;;  When you visit a search context, both `icicle-occur' and
;;  `icicle-search' highlight that hit.  For `icicle-occur', the
;;  search context is the current line.  For `icicle-search', it is
;;  whatever your search-context regexp matches.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Search Key Bindings")
;;  ** Icicles Search Key Bindings **
;;
;;  There are many Icicles search commands, most of which are bound to
;;  keys when you are in Icicle minor mode.  They are all placed on
;;  the same prefix key, `M-s M-s'.  Starting with Emacs 23, a single
;;  `M-s' is the standard Emacs prefix key for search.  Just hit the
;;  key twice for Icicles search.
;;
;;  The most general Icicles search command is `icicle-search', which
;;  is bound to `M-s M-s M-s'.  It is also bound to `C-c `'.  (In some
;;  modes these keys are bound to a mode-specific form of Icicles
;;  search.)
;;
;;  The Icicles search keys are generally mnemonic.  Some of the
;;  commands also have an alternative key binding (in parentheses in
;;  the list below).
;;
;;  Remember too that you can also invoke some of these same commands
;;  using a prefix argument with the generic `icicle-search' keys.
;;  For example, you can invoke the commands bound to `M-s M-s m'
;;  using a zero prefix argument with `icicle-search' - e.g., `C-0 M-s
;;  M-s M-s' or `C-0 C-c `'.
;;
;;  Here are the suffix keys on the `M-s M-s' prefix key:
;;
;;  `M-s'     `icicle-search'   - Seach buffer areas that match regexp
;;            (`C-c `')
;;  `M-s'     `icicle-comint-search' - Retrieve a previous shell input
;;            (`C-c `')
;;  `M-s'     `icicle-compilation-search'    - Search compilation hits
;;            - e.g `grep' hits (`C-c `')
;;
;;  `,'       `icicle-tags-search' - Search files listed in TAGS table
;;  `b'       `icicle-search-buffer' (`C-1') - Search selected buffers
;;  `c'       `icicle-search-char-property' - Search text having a
;;            given text or overlay property
;;  `d'       `icicle-search-defs' (aka `icicle-imenu') (`C-c =')
;;  `D'       `icicle-search-defs-full' (aka `icicle-imenu-full')
;;            full definitions as completion candidates
;;  `f'       `icicle-search-file' (`C--')     - Search selected files
;;  `i'       `icicle-imenu' (aka `icicle-search-defs') - Navigate
;;            among Imenu entries (`C-c =')
;;  `I'       `icicle-imenu-full' (aka `icicle-search-defs-full')
;;            full definitions as completion candidates
;;            `icicle-imenu-command' - command definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-face' - face definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-macro' - macro definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' -
;;            non-interactive function definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-user-option' - user option definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-key-explicit-map' - key definitions
;;            `icicle-imenu-key-implicit-map' - key definitions
;;  `j'       `icicle-search-bookmark'              - Search bookmarks
;;            `icicle-search-*-bookmark'   - Bookmarks of a given type
;;  `J'       `icicle-search-bookmarks-together' (`C-u'),
;;  `k'       `icicle-search-keywords' - Search with regexp keywords
;;            (`C-c ^')
;;  `l'       `icicle-search-lines' (aka `icicle-occur') (`C-c '')
;;  `C-l'     `icicle-search-pages'               - Search Emacs pages
;;  `m'       `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked' - Marked bookmarks
;;  `m'       `icicle-search-buff-menu-marked' - Search marked buffers
;;  `m'       `icicle-search-ibuffer-marked'   - Search marked buffers
;;  `m'       `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive' - Search Dired
;;            marked files, including in subdirectories
;;  `M'       `icicle-occur-dired-marked-recursive' - Search lines of
;;            Dired marked files, including in subdirectories
;;  `o'       `icicle-occur' (aka `icicle-search-lines') - An `occur'
;;            with incremental completion (`C-c '')
;;  `O'       `icicle-search-overlay-property' - Search text having a
;;            given overlay property
;;  `p'       `icicle-search-paragraphs'     - Search Emacs paragraphs
;;  `s'       `icicle-search-sentences' - Search sentences as contexts
;;  `t'       `icicle-search-thing'    - Search thing-at-point things,
;;            optionally ignoring comments
;;  `T'       `icicle-search-text-property' - Search text having a
;;            given text property (`C-c "')                        ["]
;;  `w'       `icicle-search-word' - Whole words as contexts (`C-c $')
;;  `x'       `icicle-search-xml-element' - Search XML elements
;;  `X'       `icicle-search-xml-element-text-node'- Search text nodes
;;
;;  (You need library library `Bookmark+' for
;;  `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked'.  You need library `Dired+'
;;  for `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive'.)
;;
;;  There are many `icicle-search-*-bookmark' commands, for searching
;;  within bookmarks of various types.
;;
;;  And there are several `icicle-imenu-*' commands for navigating
;;  among definitions of different kinds.  For each of the
;;  `icicle-menu*' commands there is a `-full' version that searches
;;  the full text of a definition.
;;
;;  When you use one of these full-definition search commands, the
;;  completion candidates can be quite large, spanning several lines
;;  each.  In this context it can be handy to hide, in buffer
;;  `*Completions*', the lines that do not match your current
;;  minibuffer input.  You can do this at any time by using command
;;  `icicle-toggle-hiding-non-matching-lines', bound to `C-u C-x .',
;;  to toggle user option `icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag'.
;;
;;  The commands that search zones of text that have a given character
;;  (text or overlay) property value work with any kind of property.
;;  They work specially for properties `face' (or `font-lock-face')
;;  and `mumamo-major-mode'.  If you use library MuMaMo, which lets
;;  you, in effect, use multiple major modes at the same time in the
;;  same buffer, then you can use `M-s M-s c' and `M-s M-s O' to
;;  search the zones corresponding to a given major mode.  See the doc
;;  string for command `icicle-search-char-property' for more
;;  information.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search-thing' (`M-s M-s t') searches the text of
;;  thing-at-point things.  It prompts you for the thing type: `sexp',
;;  `sentence', `list', `string', `comment', etc.  It ignores comments
;;  according to options `icicle-ignore-comments-flag' and
;;  `icicle-hide-whitespace-before-comment-flag'.  You can toggle this
;;  ignoring using `C-M-;' at any time.  When comments are ignored,
;;  the candidate things (e.g. sexps) to be searched are only those
;;  outside of comments.
;;
;;(@* "How Icicles Search Works")
;;  ** How Icicles Search Works **
;;
;;  All Icicles search commands operate in the same general way:
;;
;;  1. Unlike standard incremental search, Icicles search commands
;;     search the entire buffer, not just the part that follows the
;;     cursor.  If the region is active, however, then the search is
;;     confined to the region.  Some Icicles search commands let you
;;     search across multiple buffers, multiple files, or multiple
;;     bookmarks, including region bookmarks.  Searching within one or
;;     more such regions of text is a first way to limit the context
;;     of a search.
;;
;;  2. You limit the search context in a second way, by providing some
;;     information, such as a regexp or a text or overlay property,
;;     that defines zones of text that you want to search.  You can
;;     use (lax) completion against previous input to enter the regexp
;;     or the text or overlay property.  In some cases, the
;;     information (e.g. regexp) to define the search context is
;;     provided automatically by the search command; for example,
;;     `icicle-occur' assumes that you want to search lines.
;;
;;  3. If you use a regexp to define the search context, and if that
;;     regexp has subgroups, that is, subexpressions of the form
;;     `\(...\)', then you are prompted for the subgroup to use to
;;     define the search context.  0 means the entire regexp match is
;;     used as a context.  1 means that whatever the first subgroup
;;     matches is used as a context, and so on.
;;
;;     Using a subgroup thus limits the search context in a third way.
;;     It lets you find a search match within a larger search-match
;;     context.  For example, you might choose a Lisp argument list as
;;     the search context, specifying that it must follow `(defun ':
;;     `(defun [^(]*\(([^(]*)\)'.  Subgroup 1 is the argument list.
;;     Specifying a subgroup search context helps you become more
;;     familiar with regexps.  Icicles search highlighting (see below)
;;     shows you the subgroup matches instantly.
;;
;;  4. You can limit the set of search contexts in a fourth way, by
;;     using `M-&' to provide predicates that search-context
;;     candidates must satisfy.  Command `icicle-search' and its
;;     derivative functions use candidates of the form (CONTEXT
;;     . MARKER), where CONTEXT is a string, the search hit (search
;;     context), and MARKER is a buffer marker that locates the
;;     CONTEXT.  Predicates you supply to the `M-&' prompt must expect
;;     such candidates.  Only contexts that satisfy the predicate are
;;     found.  For example, if the predicate is (lambda (x) (commandp
;;     (intern-soft (car x)))), then only contexts that name Emacs
;;     commands are found.  Or, if you have a predicate `verbp' that
;;     tests whether a word is an English verb form, then you can use
;;     that to limit word matches to verbs.  In this way, you can
;;     combine purely syntactic searching (regexp or text-property
;;     match) with more semantic search criteria.  After building up a
;;     complex predicate by using `M-&', you can save it to a variable
;;     with `C-M-&' and then reuse it later with `C-='.
;;     See also (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "`M-&': Satisfying Additional Predicates").
;;
;;  5. Icicles finds all of the qualified search contexts, and
;;     presents them to you as completion candidates.  As always for
;;     Icicles completion, the number of search hits (matching
;;     candidates), is displayed in the mode-line of buffer
;;     `*Completions*' - e.g., `72 candidates'.
;;
;;  6. You can navigate among the source-buffer search contexts, using
;;     the multi-command action keys (`C-next', `C-prior', `C-RET',
;;     `C-mouse-2').  The contexts are highlighted in the source
;;     buffer(s).  You can scroll the current search-hits buffer
;;     forward and backward using `C-M-v' and `C-M-S-v' (aka `C-M-V').
;;     Whenever the destination would be off-screen, user option
;;     `icicle-recenter' is passed to `recenter' to make it visible.
;;
;;  7. As always in Icicles, your current minibuffer input filters the
;;     set of current candidates - the search contexts, so that only
;;     those that contain matches to your input remain as candidates.
;;     This is a second level of matching: looking for a refinement
;;     pattern within the search contexts. And this constitutes a
;;     fifth way you can limit the set of search contexts.
;;
;;  8. As always in Icicles, this input can be a regexp.  This is
;;     ordinary apropos completion, applied to searching.  You do not
;;     type `RET' to enter this regexp, and you can change it on the
;;     fly to change the set of search hits.  Icicles searching is
;;     thus incremental, in the sense that changing your input
;;     dynamically changes the set of matching search hits.  Icicles
;;     searching is not incremental with respect to the initial,
;;     context matching, however.
;;
;;  9. As always in Icicles, you can type some input and then hit
;;     `C-~' to remove all candidates that match that input.  Then
;;     type some other input and hit `C-~' again to remove those
;;     matches.  Or you can use `M-&' to define a predicate, and then
;;     hit `C-~' to remove all candidates that satisfy that predicate.
;;     And so on.  And you can use `S-mouse-2' or the `delete' key to
;;     remove individual search hits.  These techniques let you chip
;;     away at the search set, removing hits that are uninteresting.
;;     This is a very powerful technique for both searching and
;;     search-and-replace (see next), and it constitutes a sixth way
;;     to limit the set of search contexts.  See also
;;     (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Chip Away the Non-Elephant").
;;
;;  10. You can sort the search hits in various ways.  This can
;;     facilitate navigation and comparison of hits, as well as
;;     search-and-replace (see #11).  And you can define your own
;;     Icicles search commands that provide custom search orders for
;;     particular kinds of search.  It is likely that you have never
;;     considered being able to sort search hits, but if you think
;;     about it you will see that this can be handy.  If you are
;;     searching across multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks, sorting
;;     helps you compare, visit, and replace related hits from the
;;     different sources, instead of having to handle all of the hits
;;     from each source in turn.
;;
;;  11. You can replace text while you search, forward, backward, or
;;     randomly.  You can replace entire search contexts or just the
;;     parts that match your current input.  You can use any
;;     replacement string that is allowed by `query-replace-regexp'.
;;     In Emacs 22 or later, this includes `\,', to substitute the
;;     result of a Lisp evaluation.  Use the alternative-action keys
;;     for replacement: `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2', `C-S-down',
;;     `C-S-up', `C-S-next', `C-S-prior', `C-S-end', and `C-S-home'.
;;     At the first use, you are prompted for the replacement string;
;;     it is used thereafter.  You can use `M-|'
;;     (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to replace all
;;     matches.  See (@> "Search and Replace").
;;
;;  12. When you visit a search context (using `C-mouse-2' or
;;     `C-down', for example), the part of the candidate that matches
;;     your input is highlighted.  An entire search context is
;;     highlighted in face `icicle-search-main-regexp-current', and
;;     the part that matches your input is highlighted in face
;;     `icicle-search-current-input'.  All other search contexts are
;;     also highlighted (in face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').
;;     The effect is similar to the Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting
;;     of Isearch (except that the highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  13. User option `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;     controls whether the input matches are highlighted within each
;;     search context or only within the current context.  Together
;;     with `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match', it controls whether
;;     the input-match highlighting covers an expanded common match
;;     among all matches or just the exact input match.
;;
;;  14. If you do not use a subgroup to define the search context (as
;;     in #3, above), that is, if the search context corresponds to
;;     the entire search regexp, then up to eight context levels
;;     (subgroups) are each highlighted differently, using faces
;;     `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;     `icicle-search-context-level-8'.  This context-level
;;     highlighting is not done if user option
;;     `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag' is `nil'.
;;
;;  You might have noticed that out of these 14 search features, 6
;;  constitute independent ways in which you can narrow or limit the
;;  set of search hits among which you can navigate.  And another one
;;  (sorting) further facilitates your observation and selection of
;;  search hits.  Restricting the search space and making search-hit
;;  patterns more evident are in fact what search is all about, and
;;  Icicles offers you some unique tools to do this.
;;
;;  For several Icicles search commands, including `icicle-search'
;;  (`C-c `'), you provide an initial regexp to define the search
;;  contexts (step 1, above).  Why use two regexps to search (steps 1
;;  and 4, above)?  To make things simpler.  Regular expressions are
;;  powerful for searching, but they can also be cumbersome sometimes.
;;  Why not use one simple regexp to set up a set of candidates and
;;  then, optionally, use a second simple regexp to filter those
;;  candidates?
;;
;;  This is the same idea as that behind progressive completion.  And
;;  speaking of which, how would you find a line that contains a given
;;  set of words (each of them), but in an arbitrary (unknown) order?
;;  Progressive completion.  Which lines in this doc section contain
;;  the words `which', `you', and `how', in any order?  If you are
;;  reading this doc in file `icicles-doc2.el', then just use
;;  `icicle-occur' with progressive completion:
;;
;;    C-c ' which S-SPC you S-SPC how
;;
;;  That narrows things down to four lines that you can then navigate
;;  among.  Progressive completion gives Icicles search a power boost.
;;
;;  Like `icicle-occur', commands `icicle-search-word' (`C-c $') and
;;  `icicle-search-keywords' (`C-c ^') are variants of `icicle-search'
;;  that differ only in the regexp used.  Each accepts your input and
;;  converts it to a regexp that does the right thing.
;;  `icicle-search-word' just adds `\b' before and after the word you
;;  type, so that it matches at word boundaries.
;;
;;  `icicle-search-keywords' wraps the keywords you provide as input
;;  with regexp grouping (`\(...\)') and alternative (`\|') syntax, so
;;  that search looks for any of the keywords.
;;
;;  "Keywords" here is an understatement. Each keyword is actually a
;;  regexp and is treated as such, unless you use `C-`' to turn on
;;  escaping of regexp special characters.  In that case, each keyword
;;  is matched as a substring.  At the `C-c $' prompt, you can use
;;  completion to choose keywords that you have already entered, or
;;  you can use `C-RET' to enter new keywords.
;;
;;  As a shortcut, you can use the search string during incremental
;;  search (Isearch) as the initial regexp for `icicle-search'.  You
;;  do this by hitting `S-TAB' during Isearch.  This ends Isearch and
;;  passes its search string to `icicle-search'.  This can be a handy
;;  way to start `icicle-search', picking up its search pattern by
;;  using, say, `C-s C-w C-w...'.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Launch Icicles Search using the Isearch Search String")
;;
;;(@* "Search Outside the Defined Search Contexts")
;;  ** Search Outside the Defined Search Contexts **
;;
;;  For each of the predefined Icicles search commands, including for
;;  `icicle-search' itself, you can alternatively choose to search,
;;  not the search contexts as you define them, but the non-contexts,
;;  that is, the buffer text that is outside (in between) the search
;;  contexts as defined.
;;
;;  For example, if you use `icicle-search-thing' and you define sexps
;;  as the search contexts, then this feature lets you search the
;;  zones of text that are not within a sexp.  Or if you use
;;  `icicle-search-text-property' (`C-c "'), you can search the zones
;;  of text that do not have a text-property value that you specify
;;  (e.g., property `face' with faces `font-lock-comment-face' and
;;  `font-lock-comment-delimiter-face' - which means all code outside
;;  comments).
;;
;;  To turn this context-complementing feature on and off, hit `C-M-~'
;;  (`icicle-toggle-search-complementing-domain') during completion.
;;  This is a toggle, and it affects only future search commands, not
;;  the current one.
;;
;;(@* "Search Multiple Buffers, Files, and Bookmarks")
;;  ** Search Multiple Buffers, Files, and Bookmarks **
;;
;;  If you provide a prefix argument to most Icicles search functions,
;;  then you can search multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks.
;;
;;  * Plain prefix argument (`C-u') - Search multiple bookmarks of
;;    various kinds.  To use this feature, you must also use library
;;    `bookmark+.el'.  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;  * Positive numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C-9') - Search multiple
;;    buffers - you are prompted for the buffers to search.  If the
;;    prefix argument is 99, then only buffers that are visiting files
;;    are candidates.  You can use `C-RET' and so on to choose
;;    individual buffers with completion.  You can use `C-!' to choose
;;    all buffers or all buffers that match a regexp.
;;    (See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").)
;;
;;  * Negative numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C--') - Search multiple
;;    files in the current directory - you are prompted for the files
;;    to search.  As for multiple-buffer searching, you can use
;;    `C-RET' and so on.
;;
;;  * Zero numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C-0') - Search multiple
;;    bookmarks, buffers, or files appropriate for the current major
;;    mode.  In Dired, this means the marked files.  In Ibuffer or
;;    Buffer Menu, it means the marked buffers.  In the bookmark list,
;;    it means the marked bookmarks (you need `Bookmark+' for this).
;;    In such modes the same behavior is typically available on
;;    another key as well (e.g. `M-s M-s m'), as a separate command.
;;
;;  As a convenience, some specialized Icicles commands are defined
;;  that correspond to `icicle-search' with the various
;;  prefix-argument cases: `icicle-search-bookmarks-together',
;;  `icicle-search-buffer', and `icicle-search-file'.  If you often
;;  use `C-c `' with one of the prefix-argument options, then you
;;  might want to bind one or more of these commands.  These commands
;;  are also available in the Icicles menu-bar menu (or the Search
;;  menu, if it exists).
;;
;;(@* "User Options for Icicles Searching")
;;  ** User Options for Icicles Searching **
;;
;;  You can customize the following user options to control search and
;;  replacement behavior.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' is non-`nil' (the default
;;    value), then, whenever you use a prefix argument, Icicles search
;;    functions annotate each candidate with the name of the buffer
;;    where the search hit occurs, highlighted, to help orient you.
;;    The buffer name is actually part of the (multi-completion)
;;    candidate, so you can match against it.
;;
;;    Note that even when the value of this option is `nil', if option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay' is greater than zero then you
;;    can see the buffer name in the mode-line (as well as the
;;    position and length of the search context in the buffer).
;;
;;  * Icicles search functions that use an initial regexp highlight
;;    the first `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' matches for that
;;    regexp at once (using face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').
;;    The effect is similar to the Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting
;;    of Isearch (except that the highlighting is not in fact lazy).
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is `nil', then
;;    whatever matches your current input (expanded, if
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' causes expansion) is
;;    replaced, within the current search context, when you perform
;;    replacement (e.g. `C-S-RET').  If the value is non-`nil' (the
;;    default value), then the entire search context is replaced,
;;    instead.  You can use `M-_' at any time during searching and
;;    replacing, to toggle the value.
;;
;;  * If `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-`nil', then
;;    Icicles search functions highlight your current input match
;;    within *all* search contexts at once.  If it is non-`nil' and
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' is 3 or 4 (which means
;;    your input can be automatically expanded), then what is
;;    highlighted for each input match is the expanded common match
;;    among all input matches throughout the search area.  If either
;;    of these conditions does not hold, then only the exact input
;;    match is highlighted.
;;
;;    For example
;;    (see (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Nutshell View of Icicles")),
;;    if the initial regexp defining the search context is
;;    `.*recursive.*', and your input is `edit', then searching file
;;    `icicles-doc1.el' highlights not `edit' but
;;    ``abort-recursive-edit'', which is the longest common match
;;    among all input matches.
;;
;;    Gotcha: Remember that the expanded common match pertains to the
;;            entire completion candidate.  In the context of Icicles
;;            search, if you are interested in multiple matches of
;;            your input within the same search context, and you want
;;            to be sure to catch each match, then turn off
;;            common-match expansion.
;;
;;            Why?  The search context as a whole is compared with the
;;            other search contexts when looking for the expanded
;;            common match.  Your input is matched against the entire
;;            context (search hit), and the expanded common match is
;;            (typically) the longest match that is common to the
;;            other search contexts.  Do not expect the longest common
;;            match of your input against all occurrences in the
;;            search contexts.  What counts is the longest single
;;            match for a given context.
;;
;;            For example, if your input is `then' and two of the
;;            search hits are `But then X and then Y' and `W and then
;;            Z', the expanded common match will be `and then', not
;;            `then'.  The matches highlighted for your input thus do
;;            not include each occurrence of `then' in the search
;;            hits, but rather each occurrence of `and then'.
;;
;;    When `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is `nil', only
;;    the part of the search context that matches your input is
;;    replaced.  That part corresponds to your expanded input if
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' implies expansion and if
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' and
;;    `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' are both non-`nil'.
;;    Otherwise, it corresponds to only your exact input.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    is `nil', because non-`nil' can impact performance negatively if
;;    there are many search contexts - the highlighting is updated
;;    with each input change.  You can toggle the value at any time
;;    using command `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to
;;    `C-^' in the minibuffer during Icicles search.
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is non-`nil' (the default
;;    value) then search highlighting is removed after the search.  If
;;    you set this to `nil' then you can remove search highlighting
;;    manually later using command `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.
;;    You can toggle this search highlight removal at any time using
;;    command `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', which is bound to `C-.'
;;    in the minibuffer during Icicles search.
;;
;;    One use of `nil' `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight
;;    regexp matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files
;;    or...).  In that capacity, Icicles search functions act like
;;    some of the highlighting commands in my library `highlight.el'.
;;    Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is `nil', *all*
;;    Icicles search highlighting remains: last-visited search
;;    context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
;;    regexp subgroups.  The faces for these are, respectively:
;;
;;    - `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'
;;    - `icicle-search-main-regexp-others'
;;    - `icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here' (everywhere, if
;;      `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-`nil')
;;    - `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;      `icicle-search-context-level-8'
;;
;;  * Command `icicle-search-word' (bound to `C-c $') always searches
;;    for a whole word: your initial search string is matched only
;;    against whole words.  Non-`nil' `icicle-search-whole-word-flag'
;;    makes other Icicles search commands also perform whole-word
;;    searching.  You can use `M-q' while searching to toggle this
;;    option; the new value takes effect for the next complete search.
;;
;;    Whole-word searching here means that matches can contain
;;    embedded strings of non word-constituent chars (they are skipped
;;    over, when matching, included in the match), and any leading or
;;    trailing word-constituent chars in the search string are dropped
;;    (ignored for matching, not included in the match).  This means,
;;    for instance, that you can match `foo-bar' as a word, even in
;;    contexts (such as Emacs Lisp) where `-' is not a
;;    word-constituent character.  Similarly, you can include embedded
;;    whitespace in a "word", e.g., `foo bar'.
;;
;;  * You can toggle `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag' at any time using
;;    `M-g' in the minibuffer.  This is handy for multi-commands that
;;    browse, such as Icicles search.  It means that you can use
;;    `next' and so on instead of `C-next' and so on to navigate among
;;    search hits.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-ignore-comments-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-search-thing' and related commands
;;    (e.g. `icicle-search-xml-element') ignore comments.  That is,
;;    they hide comments temporarily while they scan the region or
;;    buffer for things of the given type to serve as search contexts
;;    (completion candidates).  This prevents them, for example, from
;;    presenting as a candidate a sexp or a list that is commented
;;    out.  You can toggle this option anytime using `C-M-;' in the
;;    minibuffer, but to see the effect you might need to invoke the
;;    current command again.  See also option
;;    `icicle-hide-whitespace-before-comment-flag'.
;;
;;  * `icicle-search-hook': Functions run after searching and moving
;;    to a match, whether by `RET' or `C-RET' (or `C-next' or
;;    `C-prior').
;;
;;  It can sometimes be useful to highlight all regexp matches using a
;;  large (or `t') value of `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' and a
;;  `nil' value of `icicle-search-cleanup-flag', and then set
;;  `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' to zero and use an Icicles
;;  search function again with a different regexp to search through
;;  the same region or buffer.  This lets you see the relation between
;;  the two sets of regexp matches.
;;
;;(@* "Using Regexps with Icicles Search")
;;  ** Using Regexps with Icicles Search **
;;
;;  You can use Icicles search to find text entities of a certain kind
;;  - sentences, paragraphs, file names, URLs, and so on.  A
;;  convenient way to do this is to use `C-='
;;  (`icicle-insert-string-from-variable') or `C-x r i'
;;  (`insert-register') in the minibuffer to insert a predefined
;;  regexp that matches a particular kind of text entity.  Which of
;;  these you use depends on whether the regexp string is saved in a
;;  variable (`C-=') or a register (`C-x r i').
;;
;;  For example, suppose you are in a mail client and you want to move
;;  between mail headers.  If you use a regexp that matches the header
;;  field you want (e.g. the sent date or sender) then Icicles search
;;  highlights all such occurrences and lets you navigate among them -
;;  instant mail browser!  Or, suppose you are in a C++ or Perl file
;;  and you want to navigate among function definitions or other
;;  definitions.  If you have a canned regexp that matches the start
;;  of a definition, then you can use `C-=' to quickly turn
;;  `icicle-search' into a code browser.  In a log file, navigate
;;  among date or time entries or IP addresses...  Of course, most
;;  programming modes and mail clients already provide other ways to
;;  navigate, but you get the idea - Icicles search provides a general
;;  way to navigate among things, as long as you can match them with
;;  regexps, and `C-=' lets you quickly access a library of predefined
;;  regexps.
;;
;;  You can find useful regexps to store in variables in the standard
;;  Emacs Lisp libraries.  Grep for `font-lock-keywords' or `regexp'
;;  in the Emacs `lisp' directory and its subdirectories.
;;
;;   See `align.el' for regexps for programming languages.
;;   See `url-dav.el' for regexps matching ISO 8601 dates.
;;   See `rmail.el', `sendmail.el', and `mh-show.el' for regexps
;;   matching mail-header fields.
;;
;;  Imenu regexps occurring as parts of different values of
;;  `imenu-generic-expression' for different buffer types can be used
;;  as variable values for `C-='.  They all work fine with
;;  `icicle-search', turning it into a navigator for the given mode.
;;  See, for example, `generic-x.el' and `lisp-mode.el'.  Here is a
;;  regexp for Javascript function definitions from `generic-x.el':
;;
;;   "^function\\s-+\\([A-Za-z0-9_]+\\)"
;;
;;  And `lisp-imenu-generic-expression' (in `lisp-mode.el') provides
;;  regexps for Lisp function, variable, and type definitions.  Here
;;  is the variable-definition regexp:
;;
;;   "^\\s-*(\\(def\\(c\\(onst\\(ant\\)?\\|ustom\\)\\|ine-symbol-macro
;;   \\|parameter\\|var\\)\\)\\s-+\\(\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+\\)"
;;
;;  You certainly do not want to type a regexp like that into the
;;  minibuffer (and the function-definition regexp is twice as
;;  complex)!  Put it into a variable or register once and use `C-='
;;  or `C-x r i' from then on to retrieve it - simple.
;;
;;  If it's so simple, then why not let a command do it?  This is
;;  exactly what command `icicle-imenu' (bound to `C-c =') does.  You
;;  do not need to bother looking up Imenu regexps and assigning them
;;  to variables for use with `C-=' and `icicle-search'-
;;  `icicle-imenu' does that for you automatically.
;;  See (@> "Other Icicles Search Commands").
;;
;;  In sum: For complete interactivity, type a regexp dynamically as
;;  input to `icicle-search'.  For isolated special regexps that you
;;  use, save them in variables and use `C-=' with `icicle-search'.
;;  For well-defined sets of regexps, especially if used frequently,
;;  define a command that uses `icicle-search'.  There is a spectrum
;;  of use cases for `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' is very general and very powerful.  It
;;  might never replace incremental search - either regexp or literal
;;  string search, but in some cases it can be quite handy.  Think of
;;  it as another tool to add to your search-tool belt.  Admittedly,
;;  it does take a little getting used to.  Remember, in particular,
;;  that the initial, context regexp you enter (with `RET') cannot be
;;  changed without re-executing `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  And remember too that `C-l' (`icicle-retrieve-previous-input') is
;;  your friend - it clears the minibuffer during cycling, retrieving
;;  your last real input.  Use it to modify your second and subsequent
;;  regexps on the fly - those that filter the initial candidate list
;;  further.  You can repeat `C-l' to retrieve older completion
;;  inputs, and you can use `C-S-l' (that is, `C-L') to cycle previous
;;  inputs in the other direction.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  Oh - And do not forget that you can do things like take the
;;  complement of your fine-tuning regexp matches, within the context
;;  of your coarse-tuning matches.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  For example, use `^.*defun.*$' as the main regexp, to find all
;;  lines containing `defun'.  Then type `icicle' to match only the
;;  lines with `defun' that also contain `icicle'.  Then complement
;;  (`C-~') that set, to see the lines that contain `defun' but not
;;  `icicle'.
;;
;;  And you can then save that set of matches, and then subtract it
;;  from another set of matches in a different search...  You get the
;;  idea.  When performing set operations combined with
;;  `icicle-search', keep in mind that the saved set does not include
;;  any position information - it is only a set of matching strings.
;;  So, in particular, a set-union operation (`C-+') is not useful
;;  with `icicle-search' (adding a saved set of strings without
;;  positions is useless).  Still, you can do things like match lines
;;  that contain `defun' followed somewhere by `()', and then subtract
;;  the (saved) set of lines in the same region that contain `icicle'.
;;  Try it in an Icicles library, using regexps `.*icicle.*$' and
;;  `^*.defun.*().*$'.
;;
;;  One more reminder: When you save a set of completion candidates
;;  (`C-M->'), make sure that you actually have a set of candidates to
;;  save!  It is not enough to just enter a regexp at the
;;  `icicle-search' prompt.  You must also use some Icicles command,
;;  such as `TAB', `S-TAB', `next', or `down' to tell Icicles how to
;;  create the candidate set - how to match the regexp.

;;(@* "Search and Replace")
;;
;;  Search and Replace
;;  ------------------
;;
;;  Replacement during Icicles search is something quite different
;;  from anything you are used to.  There are several different ways
;;  to replace search-hit text during Icicles search, and it can be a
;;  bit of a challenge to understand all the possibilities.  So my
;;  advice is to experiment, as well as to read the descriptions here.
;;
;;  You can replace the current search match by using any of the
;;  alternative action keys: `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2' (in
;;  `*Completions*'), `C-S-down', `C-S-up', `C-S-next', `C-S-prior',
;;  `C-S-end', or `C-S-home', .  You can use `M-|'
;;  (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to replace all matches
;;  of your current input at once, throughout the search space.
;;
;;  At the first use of any of these, you are prompted for the
;;  replacement; it is used thereafter, or until you use `M-,'
;;  (`icicle-search-define-replacement').  You can use `M-,' at any
;;  time during searching to change the replacement for subsequent
;;  replacing.
;;
;;  Normatlly the replacement is a pattern (a string), which can be
;;  anything that is allowed as a replacement by
;;  `query-replace-regexp'.  In Emacs 22 and later, this includes Lisp
;;  sexp evaluation via `\,'.
;;
;;  Alternatively, the replacement you define can be a Lisp function,
;;  which is applied to the match that is to be replaced, to produce
;;  the actual text replacement.  To define a function for
;;  replacement, use a prefix argument with `M-,` (or with `C-S-RET'
;;  etc.).
;;
;;  Unlike `query-replace', you need not visit each search match - you
;;  can visit and replace selected matches in any order.  Some other
;;  differences from standard `query-replace' and
;;  `query-replace-regexp':
;;
;;   * Replacing matches of your current input provides a contextual
;;     replacement feature: replace `foo' by `fu', but only in zones
;;     that match `toto.*titi'.
;;
;;   * Icicles search navigation (`C-next', etc.) lets you replace
;;     individual search hits without navigating through each search
;;     context in turn: direct access.
;;
;;   * In Icicles search, replace-all (`M-|') means replace all
;;     matches of your current input, throughout the search space, not
;;     just all matches that follow the cursor.  And remember that you
;;     can (a) activate the region to limit the search-and-replace
;;     space and (b) use progressive completion etc. to narrow the set
;;     of hits.
;;
;;   * You can act across multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks -
;;     see information about the `icicle-search' prefix argument.
;;
;;   * You can also replace matches within text-property search
;;     contexts - just use `icicle-search-text-property' (`C-c "') ["]
;;     as the search command.
;;
;;   * As mentioned above, you can replace matches with the result of
;;     applying a function to them.
;;
;;  Search matches are replaced - but just what is meant by a "search
;;  match"?  It can be either an entire search context or each match
;;  of your current minibuffer input within a search context.
;;
;;  Anytime during search and replace:
;;
;;   * `M-,' redefines the replacement string.
;;
;;   * `C-`' toggles `icicle-toggle-regexp-quote' (as always).  This
;;     escapes regexp special characters, so that search is literal.
;;
;;   * `M-q' toggles `icicle-search-whole-word-flag'.  By default,
;;     this is `nil', meaning that searching is not for whole words
;;     (except for `icicle-search-word', bound to `C-c $').
;;
;;   * `C-M-`' toggles `icicle-search-replace-literally-flag'.  By
;;      default, this is `nil', which means that `\' character
;;      sequences in replacement text are intrepreted as for
;;      `query-replace-regexp'.
;;
;;   * `M-_' toggles `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag'.  By
;;     default, this is non-`nil', which means that the entire current
;;     search context is replaced, that is, whatever matches the
;;     context regexp that you entered initially using `RET'.
;;     However, you can use `M-_' anytime during searching to toggle
;;     between this default behavior and replacement of whatever your
;;     current minibuffer input matches.
;;
;;   * `M-;' toggles `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag'.
;;     Together with other options, it controls whether to replace the
;;     expanded common match or just the exact match.  See below.
;;
;;  REMEMBER THIS:
;;
;;  - If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is true
;;    (non-`nil'), then the granularity of replacement is a complete
;;    search context.  In this case, replacement behaves similarly to
;;    `query-replace-regexp' (except that special replacement
;;    constructs, such as `\#', are not treated as such).  You can
;;    still use minibuffer input to filter the set of search contexts,
;;    but replacement is on a whole-context basis.
;;
;;  - If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is false
;;    (`nil'), then you can replace multiple input matches separately
;;    within a search context (using `C-S-RET').  This behavior is
;;    unique to Icicles.  You cannot, however skip over one input
;;    match and replace the next one in the same context - `C-S-RET'
;;    always replaces the first available match in the context
;;    (repeated use changes which is first).  When
;;    `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is `nil', you can
;;    also use special replacement constructs, such as `\#'.
;;
;;  If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is true, then you
;;  can use the navigational alternative action keys, `C-S-down',
;;  `C-S-up', `C-S-next', `C-S-prior', `C-S-end', and `C-S-home',
;;  repeatedly to replace successive search contexts.  At the buffer
;;  limits, these commands wrap around to the other buffer limit (last
;;  search context to first, and vice versa).
;;
;;  Search traversal using these go-to-next-context-and-replace keys
;;  is always by search context, not by individual input match.  This
;;  means that you cannot use these keys to replace input matches
;;  within a search context.
;;
;;  If `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is false, then you
;;  can use these keys to replace the first input match.  More
;;  importantly, you can use `C-S-RET' to replace that first match,
;;  without moving on to the next context.  Because `C-S-RET' always
;;  acts on the current search hit (context), using it again, after
;;  you have used it to replace the first such match, replaces the
;;  next one.  And so on.
;;
;;  Thus, if your input matches multiple parts of a search context and
;;  you want to replace these matches, use `C-S-RET' repeatedly.
;;  After all of the matches in the current context have been
;;  replaced, `C-S-RET' replaces the first match in the next context.
;;  (There is a gotcha, however, if the replacement text matches your
;;  input - see below.)
;;
;;  You can thus traverse all matches of your input, in the current
;;  sort order (by default, the order they appear in the source being
;;  searched), by just repeating `C-S-RET'.  At the buffer limits,
;;  repeating `C-S-RET' wraps around.
;;
;;  `C-S-RET' always replaces the first input match in the
;;  current search context or, if there are no matches, then the first
;;  input match in the next context.  This behavior has these
;;  important consequences:
;;
;;  * If you repeat `C-S-RET' and the previous replacement no longer
;;    matches your input, then `C-S-RET' moves on to the next input
;;    match (which is now the first one) and replaces that.  This is
;;    why you can usually just repeat `C-S-RET' to successively
;;    replaces matches of your input, including from one context to
;;    the next.
;;
;;  * If, on the other hand, after replacement the text still matches
;;    your input, then repeating `C-S-RET' will just replace that
;;    match.  For example, if you replace the input match `ab' by
;;    `abcd', then repeating `C-S-RET' produces `abcd', then `abcdcd',
;;    then `abcdcdcd',...
;;
;;  * You cannot replace an input match, skip the next match, and then
;;    replace the following one, all in the same context.  You can,
;;    however, replace some matches and then skip (e.g. `C-next') to
;;    the next context.
;;
;;  What your input matches, hence what gets replaced if
;;  `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is `nil', depends on
;;  a few Icicles options:
;;
;;  - `icicle-regexp-quote-flag' determines whether to use regexp
;;    matching or literal matching.
;;
;;  - `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match',
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag', and
;;    `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' together determine
;;    whether to replace exactly what your input matches in the
;;    current search hit or the expanded common match (ECM) of your
;;    input among all search hits.  If
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' does not cause your input
;;    to be expanded (no ECM), or if either of the other options is
;;    `nil', then your exact input match is replaced.  Otherwise, the
;;    ECM is replaced.
;;
;;  The replacement string can be nearly anything that is allowed as a
;;  replacement by `query-replace-regexp'.  In Emacs 22 or later, this
;;  includes Emacs-Lisp sexp evaluation via `\,' and constructs such
;;  as `\#' and `\N' (back references).  You can also use `\?', but it
;;  is not very useful - you might as well use `M-,' instead, to
;;  change the replacement text.
;;
;;  Finally, let me repeat what I said at the beginning of this page:
;;  Icicles search-and-replace is different from what you are used to,
;;  and there are several different ways to use it.  Experiment to get
;;  to know how it works, and reread the description here.
;;
;;  It is important to understand the various user options (with their
;;  toggle commands) and their effects.  They can radically change the
;;  behavior of replacement.
;;
;;  In particular, to put Icicles search-and-replace to best advantage
;;  you need to know what gets replaced, depending on those user
;;  options: the whole search hit vs only input matches, an exact
;;  input match vs the expanded common match.  Experiment with the
;;  toggles `M-_', `C-^', `C-"', and `M-;'.  And you need to know how
;;  repeated `C-S-RET' works vs repeated `C-S-next'.
;;
;;  I know it's tricky to learn.  Experimenting helps.  If something
;;  happens that you did not expect, reread this section and try to
;;  understand.  Have fun.

;;
;;  Other Icicles Search Commands
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Function `icicle-search' is very general.  As is explained in
;;  (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview"), command `icicle-occur'
;;  is defined trivially using `icicle-search' - it is basically
;;  `icicle-search' with a regexp of `.*', to match lines.  Similarly,
;;  `icicle-search-word' (`C-c $') uses a regexp of `\bWORD\b', where
;;  `WORD' is the word to look for, and `icicle-search-keywords'
;;  (`C-c ^') uses a regexp of `\(KW1\|KW2\|KW2...\|KWn\)', where the
;;  `KWm' are the keywords (regexps) to look for.
;;
;;  Still other Icicles commands are available that make use of
;;  `icicle-search'.  And you can define your own, specialized search
;;  commands along the same lines.  To do that, it is instructive to
;;  look at the source code of the commands described in this section;
;;  they can serve as a model for defining your own search commands.
;;
;;  Two of the commands described here, `icicle-compilation-search'
;;  and `icicle-comint-search', are specialized versions of
;;  `icicle-search' that work only in particular buffers where there
;;  is little need for `icicle-search' itself. For this reason, these
;;  commands reuse the key sequence, `C-c `' (backquote), that is
;;  normally bound to `icicle-search'.  This shadow binding occurs if
;;  the current major mode is a compilation mode (for
;;  `icicle-compilation-search') or an interactive interpreter mode
;;  such as `shell-mode' or Lisp interactive mode (for
;;  `icicle-comint-search').
;;
;;  [Programmer Note: Actually, the way this works is that `C-c `' and
;;  `M-s M-s M-s' are bound to `icicle-search-generic', which calls
;;  the command that is the value of internal variable
;;  `icicle-search-command'.  You can use this mechanism to provide
;;  custom Icicles search commands for particular buffers.]
;;
;;  Besides the commands described in this section, there are Icicles
;;  search commands for navigating tags-file definitions and searching
;;  their associated source files.  These are described in section
;;  (@> "Icicles Enhancements for Emacs Tags").
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle option
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate when using any Icicles search
;;  command.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;(@* "Searching Text with Properties")
;;  ** Searching Text with Properties **
;;
;;  Instead of providing a context regexp, for commands
;;  `icicle-search-char-property', `icicle-search-overlay-property',
;;  and `icicle-search-text-property' (`C-c "') ["] you provide a text
;;  or overlay property (e.g. `face') and its value
;;  (e.g. `font-lock-function-name-face').  All zones of text that
;;  have that property with that value become the completion
;;  candidates (search hits).  As always, you can filter this set of
;;  candidates by typing input in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  `icicle-search-char-property' searches either or both kinds of
;;  property: text or overlay; `icicle-search-overlay-property'
;;  searches only overlay properties; `icicle-search-text-property'
;;  (`C-c "' ["]) searches only text properties.
;;
;;  For example, if you use `icicle-search-char-property' with a
;;  `face' property value `highlight', then the text searched includes
;;  text with that overlay value and text with that text-property
;;  value.  With a `face' property value of `font-lock-string-face',
;;  you can browse or search doc strings, and so on.
;;
;;  If the property chosen is `face', then you can in fact choose
;;  multiple faces, in multi-command fashion (e.g. `C-mouse-2'), and
;;  the text that is searched has at least one of the faces you
;;  choose.  If you choose no face value (empty input), then the
;;  target is text that has any face at all.  The search hits are
;;  zones of text that are distinguished by their `face' values.
;;
;;  As with other Icicles search commands, a prefix argument controls
;;  whether these property-searching commands search the current
;;  buffer, selected bookmarks, selected files, or selected buffers.
;;  However, keep in mind that, since in this case you are searching
;;  text or overlay properties, you will find search hits only for
;;  buffers that already have such properties, for example, buffers
;;  that have been fontified.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Imenu")
;;  ** Icicles Imenu **
;;
;;  Command `icicle-imenu', which is bound to `C-c =', is an Imenu
;;  browser.  It lets you use Icicles completion to navigate among or
;;  search the content of definitions of functions, variables, macros,
;;  keys, and so on in a programming language (any language that Imenu
;;  handles).  As always in Icicles, your current input (e.g. a
;;  regexp) filters the set of available candidates.  That is, you can
;;  match against parts of an Imenu entry - any parts.  That's
;;  particularly useful if there are many entries in the Imenu menu;
;;  you do not need to read/scan the whole list.
;;
;;  If you look at the definition of `icicle-imenu' you'll see that it
;;  simply lets you choose an Imenu submenu (`Functions', `Options',
;;  and so on) that is appropriate for the current buffer type, and
;;  then it calls `icicle-search', passing it the appropriate Imenu
;;  regexp.  You can similarly define your own specialized search
;;  commands using `icicle-search' to browse regexp matches.  You get
;;  all of the features of `icicle-search' when you do that.  For
;;  example, `icicle-imenu' gives you these advantages over a standard
;;  Imenu menu:
;;
;;  * You can restrict navigation (search) to a region.
;;
;;  * You can navigate (browse) among multiple entries, instead of
;;    choosing them one by one from a menu.
;;
;;  * You can restrict the entries to browse using (regexp) pattern
;;    matching.
;;
;;  * As for `icicle-search', you can search multiple bookmarks,
;;    multiple buffers, or multiple files.
;;
;;  When you use an Icicles Imenu command, first you choose a submenu
;;  for a given object type (e.g. submenu `Functions' for functions),
;;  and then you choose an object definition from that submenu.  But
;;  multiple regexps can be used for a given Imenu submenu, such as
;;  `Function'.  Icicles Imenu commands use these regexps separately,
;;  so they present multiple completion candidates with the same name
;;  when you choose the object type.
;;
;;  For example, if two different regexps are used to gather function
;;  definitions then there might be two corresponding `Functions'
;;  candidates (depending on whether there are matches for each of the
;;  regexps).  Choosing one or the other of these submenu candidates
;;  then gives you different function choices.  (Remember that you can
;;  cycle to choose among multiple candidates that have the same
;;  name.)
;;
;;(@* "Type-Specific Imenu Commands")
;;  *** Type-Specific Imenu Commands ***
;;
;;  In addition, Icicles provides specializations of `icicle-imenu',
;;  to find only definitions of particular types:
;;
;;  `icicle-imenu-command', `icicle-imenu-face',
;;  `icicle-imenu-key-explicit-map', `icicle-imenu-key-implicit-map',
;;  `icicle-imenu-macro', `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function',
;;  `icicle-imenu-user-option', `icicle-imenu-variable'
;;
;;  All of these commands use only the Imenu regexps that match
;;  entities of different types.  Because these regexps were designed
;;  (for Imenu) only to locate the start of a definition, they
;;  generally do not match full definitions.  This makes them OK for
;;  use by an Icicles multi-command as a browser, to navigate among
;;  definitions.  But it does not make them useful for searching the
;;  content of definitions.
;;
;;(@* "Imenu Commands that Search Full Definitions")
;;  *** Imenu Commands that Search Full Definitions ***
;;
;;  Icicles also provides a similar set of commands, with the same
;;  names but with suffix `-full', which do use full definitions as
;;  the completion candidates, so you can search those bodies.  When
;;  you only want to navigate, you will generally use the non `-full'
;;  commands because the candidates are simpler.  When you want to
;;  search you will generally use the `-full' commands.
;;
;;  Be aware that "full" really means what it says only for
;;  definitions in languages like Lisp.  These commands in fact first
;;  match the Imenu regexp, then use the text between the regexp match
;;  beginning and one sexp forward.  In the case of Lisp sexps, that
;;  means they use the full sexp for the definition.  But in the case
;;  of other languages, such as C, the "full" definitions can in fact
;;  be shorter than the simple regexp matches.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Imenu Combines Benefits of Imenu and Emacs Tags")
;;  *** Icicles Imenu Combines Benefits of Imenu and Emacs Tags ***
;;
;;  * Imenu lets you navigate among definitions in a single buffer.
;;
;;  * Emacs tags let you navigate among definitions in multiple files,
;;    but you must build and update the tags file that identifies the
;;    definitions.
;;
;;  Like Emacs tags, Icicles Imenu commands let you navigate among
;;  definitions in multiple files - and also multiple bookmarks and
;;  multiple non-file buffers.  Like Imenu, you need not build a tags
;;  file.  Unlike Imenu, Icicles provides regexp completion that lets
;;  you filter Imenu hits that you want to visit.
;;
;;  Another difference from Emacs tags, besides the need for a tags
;;  file, is that, since Icicles locates definitions using Imenu
;;  regexps, you can only navigate among definitions in buffers that
;;  you are visiting.  This is both an advantage and a disadvantage:
;;  you can narrow the search to certain files, but you must know
;;  which files to search. And if you want to search all files, then
;;  you must open them all (e.g. by matching a project regexp),
;;
;;  The differences mean that Icicles Imenu commands do not provide a
;;  substitute for Emacs tags; they provide some similar
;;  functionality.  They add another tool to your tool belt, handier
;;  in some situations than using tags, and less useful in some other
;;  situations.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Icicles Enhancements for Emacs Tags")
;;
;;(@* "Searching Thing-At-Point Things")
;;  ** Searching Thing-At-Point Things **
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search-thing' lets you search the content of
;;  buffer zones whose text represents things of a particular kind:
;;  `sexp', `defun', `sentence', and so on.
;;
;;  Library `thingatpt+.el' provides many enhancements and some bug
;;  fixes for the basic `thing-at-point' functionality provided by
;;  vanilla library `thingatpt.el'.  I strongly recommend that you use
;;  it if you use command `icicle-search-thing'.
;;
;;  Be aware that the thing-at-point functions have as their main
;;  purpose to let you retrieve a textual thing at point.  In many
;;  cases they rely on `forward-THING' functions that do not move past
;;  the thing if point is already inside it.
;;
;;  One result of this is that in some cases the thing returned is
;;  composed only of whitespace.  That can sometimes be what you want:
;;  whitespace text is non-empty text.  But in other cases you are not
;;  interested in whitespace-only targets.  (This is not specific to
;;  Icicles search.)
;;
;;  Quiz: How would you remove whitespace-only completion candidates?
;;  By matching them and then complementing that match.  A regexp such
;;  as this matches most of them: "\` \n\t]\'".  (You could also
;;  include \r, \f, and \v.)  To get that you would hit these keys:
;;
;;    \ ` [ SPC C-q C-j C-q TAB ] + \ '
;;
;;  Then, to match the whitespace-only candidates and remove them you
;;  would hit `S-TAB C-~ S-TAB'.
;;
;;  (Be aware, BTW, that character class [:space:] does not match
;;  newline or carriage-return characters in some common Emacs modes.
;;  For example, in Emacs-Lisp mode, a newline character has syntax
;;  class `comment ender', and a carriage return character has syntax
;;  class `symbol'.  Character class [:space:] corresponds only to
;;  characters with syntax class `whitespace'.)
;;
;;(@* "Compile/Grep Search")
;;  ** Compile/Grep Search **
;;
;;  In a compilation-results buffer, such as `*Compilation*' or
;;  `*grep*', you can use command `icicle-compilation-search', bound
;;  to `C-c `', to search among the result set (search hits).  This is
;;  similar to `icicle-search', but when you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2',
;;  `C-down', `C-up', `C-next', `C-prior', `C-end', or `C-home', it
;;  visits the source code that corresponds to the current line in the
;;  compilation buffer.  Just as for `icicle-search', you can narrow
;;  the set of search contexts by typing a regexp.
;;
;;  Using `icicle-compilation-search' with `grep' gives you two levels
;;  of regexp searching: 1) the `grep' regexp and 2) your current
;;  input regexp.  And you can of course use progressive completion
;;  (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to add any number of additional levels.  (And,
;;  starting with Emacs 22, you can pipe to other `grep' commands in
;;  the same `M-x grep'.)
;;
;;  In Emacs 22 and later, you can also replace search-hit text.  You
;;  can replace the entire grep regexp match or just the part of it
;;  that matches your current input, depending on the value of option
;;  `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' (which you can toggle
;;  with `M-_').  Replacement acts here just as it does for
;;  `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  You can also use a non-`grep' compilation buffer to perform search
;;  and replace.  Use it, for example, to correct errors in source
;;  files.
;;
;;  Icicles thus gives you several ways to perform search-and-replace
;;  throughout multiple files: `grep'/compilation, `icicle-occur', and
;;  `icicle-search'.  The latter is of course not limited to
;;  line-by-line search.
;;
;;  See Also: (@> "Search and Replace").
;;
;;(@* "Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes")
;;  ** Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes **
;;
;;  In an interactive interpreter mode such as `shell-mode' or
;;  interactive Lisp mode, you can search for and reuse a previous
;;  input, possibly editing it first.  Command `icicle-comint-search',
;;  bound to `C-c `', lets you use Icicles completion and cycling to
;;  access your previous (shell or Lisp) inputs; it uses
;;  `icicle-search', so it highlights your regexp input matches, and
;;  so on.  You can use `C-$' at any time to toggle removal of
;;  duplicate past inputs as completion candidates; by default,
;;  duplicates are removed.
;;
;;  Being a search command, however, `icicle-comint-search' has access
;;  only to the commands that are visible in the buffer.  It does not
;;  use the `comint-input-ring', so it cannot, for instance, give you
;;  access to commands used in a previous session, which might have
;;  been recorded in a history file.
;;
;;  Another Icicles command, `icicle-comint-command', which is not a
;;  search command, does use `comint-input-ring' and does give you
;;  completion and cycling against previous inputs that might not have
;;  come from the current session.  It is bound to `C-c TAB' in
;;  `comint-mode' and derived modes.
;;
;;(@* "Define Your Own Icicles Search Commands")
;;  ** Define Your Own Icicles Search Commands **
;;
;;  Function `icicle-search' is not only a useful user command; it is
;;  also a framework for you to define your own Icicles search
;;  commands.  Consult the source code for the commands presented
;;  above for models.  And consult the doc string of `icicle-search'
;;  for more information about calling it non-interactively.  In
;;  particular, note that:
;;
;;  * You can pass a functional argument instead of a regexp to
;;    `icicle-search', and it will use that function to define the
;;    search contexts.  The function is passed, as arguments, the
;;    buffer to search, the beginning and end of the search region in
;;    that buffer, and any additional arguments that you pass to
;;    `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  * You can pass a predicate argument to `icicle-search', in
;;    addition to passing a regexp, and the search contexts will be
;;    only those regexp matches that also satisfy the predicate.  The
;;    predicate takes two arguments, the search-context string and a
;;    marker at the end of the search context.  For information about
;;    this, consult the doc string for function
;;    `icicle-search-regexp-scan'.  For a model of using this feature,
;;    see the code that defines command `icicle-imenu'.
;;
;;  By using your own function to define the search contexts, either
;;  from scratch or by limiting regexp matches using a predicate, you
;;  can perform semantic-based searching.  That is, your search
;;  command can use information besides syntax to define search hits.
;;  For instance, commands `icicle-imenu-command' and
;;  `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' use the semantic predicate
;;  `commandp' to distinguish Emacs-Lisp commands from non-interactive
;;  functions.

;;
;;  Icicles Bookmark Enhancements
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Many of the enhancements described in this section are available
;;  only if you also use library `bookmark+.el' (which I recommend).
;;  `Bookmark+' is compatible with vanilla Emacs bookmarks across
;;  multiple Emacs versions.  It enhances the use of bookmarks in many
;;  ways.  The explanation here does not attempt to describe the
;;  `Bookmark+' enhancements; it describes only the Icicles features
;;  that make use of them.
;;
;;  One of the main `Bookmark+' enhancements is support for new
;;  bookmark types.  Icicles provides type-specific bookmark commands
;;  and bookmark-candidate filtering.
;;
;;  In addition, when you complete the names of some kinds of objects,
;;  you can use `C-x m' to choose objects of that type.  For example,
;;  when you use `icicle-dired' (`C-x d') to complete a directory
;;  name, you can use `C-x m' to choose among your Dired bookmarks.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Accessing Saved Locations (Bookmarks) on the Fly").

;;  Regardless of the bookmark type, another `Bookmark+' feature that
;;  Icicles takes advantage of is the fact that a bookmark (any
;;  bookmark) can save not only a single position but a region, that
;;  is, two positions.  You can think of this as bookmarking, or
;;  saving, regions.  When you jump to a region bookmark, the region
;;  is activated (if option `bmkp-use-region' is non-`nil').
;;
;;  These are the main Icicles bookmarking features:
;;
;;  * Tagging files (a la delicious) and jumping to tagged files
;;  * Bookmarking the region and selecting a bookmarked region
;;  * Setting a bookmark and jumping to a bookmark
;;  * Searching the text of a bookmark's destination buffer or region
;;  * Saving sets of Icicles search hits as bookmarks - "jump" to such
;;    a bookmark to restore the saved hits during a later search.
;;  * Applying an arbitrary function to any bookmark property
;;
;;  Each is described in a little more detail below.  More generally,
;;  however, the `Bookmark+' doc is your friend.
;;
;;(@* "Using Tagged Files")
;;  ** Using Tagged Files **
;;
;;  `Bookmark+' lets you easily tag files with delicious-style tags of
;;  your choice.  You need not visit the files to do this.  Icicles
;;  makes this tagging even easier.  Tagging a file creates an
;;  autofile bookmark that records the tags (metadata).  Tags are
;;  generally strings, but you can also associate arbitrary Lisp data
;;  with them.  Besides tagging files, you can add tags to any kind of
;;  bookmark.
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, the `Bookmark+' keys for tagging and untagging
;;  files are bound to multi-commands `icicle-tag-a-file' and
;;  `icicle-untag-a-file'.
;;
;;  By default, these are on `C-x p t + a' and `C-x p t - a',
;;  respectively.  The commands are actually bound to `+ a' and `- a'
;;  in keymap `bmkp-tags-map', and you can of course bind that keymap
;;  to any key besides the default `C-x p t'.  If you bind the keymap
;;  to `f2', for instance, then `f2 + a' and `f2 - a' are all you
;;  need.
;;
;;  In addition, all Icicles file commands (and autofile bookmark
;;  commands) let you tag or untag files on the fly, during file-name
;;  completion, using the keys `C-x a +' and `C-x a -' respectively
;;  (`a' for autofile).  Similarly, you can use `C-x a a' during
;;  file-name completion to create an autofile bookmark for a file
;;  without tagging it.
;;
;;  All Icicles file commands also let you narrow the set of matching
;;  completions to those files that are tagged in certain ways, by
;;  using these keys on the fly:
;;
;;  * C-x C-t *    - files having all of the tags you specify
;;  * C-x C-t +    - files having some of the tags you specify
;;  * C-x C-t % *  - files having all of their tags matching a regexp
;;  * C-x C-t % +  - files having some of their tags matching a regexp
;;
;;  For example:
;;
;;    C-x 4 f foo TAB C-x C-t + red RET blue RET RET
;;
;;  `TAB' narrows the file-name candidates here to those starting with
;;  "foo".  `C-x C-t +' prompts for one or more tags ("red" and
;;  "blue"), then it narrows the candidates to the names of files that
;;  are tagged either "red" or "blue" (or both).
;;
;;  You can of course use progressive completion, repeating `C-x C-t
;;  +' to also require tag "yellow" or "purple", for instance.
;;
;;  There are also several Icicles multi-commands for jumping to
;;  tagged files.  They are all on the `Bookmark+' keymaps
;;  `bmkp-jump-map' and `bmkp-jump-other-window-map': prefixes `C-x j
;;  a' and `C-x 4 j a' (`a' for autofile).  The latter is for the
;;  `-other-window' version of each command.

;;  default).  As always, you can type `C-M-j' to insert this
;;  separator into the minibuffer.

;;  For this command, by default `.' in your input matches any
;;  character, including a newline.  As always, you can use `C-M-.'
;;  to toggle this (so `.' does not match newline).
;;
;;  You can match your input against the file name or tags or both.
;;  E.g., type:
;;
;;   `red S-TAB'                    to match files with the tag `red'
;;   `red S-SPC green S-SPC blue'   to match files with tags `red',
;;                                  `green', and `blue' (in any order)
;;
;;  That assumes that these tags do not also match any file names.
;;
;;  If you need to match against a particular field (e.g. the file
;;  name or a specific tag position), then use the field separator.
;;;;  Otherwise, just use progressive completion, as shown above.  
;;
;;  E.g., to match only tags and not the filename, start with `C-M-j'
;;  to get past the file-name field.  To match both file name and
;;  tags, type something to match the file name before the `C-M-j'.
;;  E.g., type:
;;
;;   `2011 C-M-j red S-SPC blue'    to match files tagged `red' and
;;                                  `blue' that have `2011' in their
;;                                  names
;;
;;  (Command `icicle-bookmark-tagged' (`C-x j t j') acts the same as
;;  `icicle-find-file-tagged', but for all tagged bookmarks, not just
;;  autofiles.)
;;
;;(@* "Jumping to Tagged Files (Other)")
;;  *** Jumping to Tagged Files (Other) ***
;;
;;  The other Icicles commands for jumping to tagged files let you
;;  input a set of tags to match, or regexps, one by one.  The
;;  commands differ only in how this set of patterns is used.  There
;;  are commands that use the intersection of the matches and commands
;;  that use the union.
;;
;;  All of them work the same way: you enter a pattern to match
;;  followed by `RET', ending with `RET RET'.  Intersection is
;;  indicated by `*' in the key binding.  Union is indicated by `+'.
;;  The regexp-matching commands have `%' in the key binding.  And
;;  again, there is an `-other-window' version of each, on prefix key
;;  `C-x 4 j t C-f' instead of `C-x j t C-f'.

;;(@* "Saving Regions and Selecting Them")
;;  ** Saving Regions and Selecting Them **
;;
;;  Saving the region just means bookmarking it.  As for any bookmark,
;;  it must have a name.  When you later jump to a region bookmark,
;;  the region is activated (provided option `bmkp-use-region' is
;;  non-`nil').
;;
;;  Icicles gives you quick ways to save a region and select
;;  (activate) a saved region.  You can do both using `C-x C-x'.
;;
;;  * With no prefix argument or with a single plain prefix argument
;;    (`C-u'), `C-x C-x' acts the same as for vanilla Emacs: it
;;    exchanges point and mark, activating the region or not depending
;;    on the use of `C-u' and whether you are in transient-mark mode.
;;
;;  * With a multiple plain prefix argument (`C-u C-u'), `C-x C-x'
;;    jumps to a region bookmark that you choose using completion, and
;;    activates it.  (See also Icicles tripping commands
;;    `icicle-select-zones' and `icicle-buffer-narrowing', which let
;;    you trip among buffer zones, selecting them as the region and
;;    narrowing to them, respectively.)
;;
;;  * With a numeric prefix argument, `C-x C-x' saves the region.  If
;;    the prefix argument is negative, then you are prompted for the
;;    name to use.  Otherwise, the bookmark is named automatically
;;    using the buffer name plus ": " plus the first
;;    `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' characters of the region text.
;;    (Newline characters are changed to spaces for the name.)
;;
;;    So if (a) you are visiting buffer `foo', (b) the region text
;;    starts with "Arise, you wretched of the earth! For justice
;;    thunders condemnation: A better world's in birth!", and (c) the
;;    value of option `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' is 15, then
;;    `C-9 C-x C-x' sets the region bookmark named `foo: Arise, you'.
;;
;;(@* "Setting a Bookmark and Jumping to a Bookmark")
;;  ** Setting a Bookmark and Jumping to a Bookmark **
;;
;;  Just as `C-x C-x' lets you either set or jump to a region
;;  bookmark, so `C-x r m' lets you either set or jump to any
;;  bookmark.  `C-x r m' is the vanilla Emacs key for setting a
;;  bookmark.  In Icicle mode it is bound by default to command
;;  `icicle-bookmark-cmd'.  By default, whatever keys are normally
;;  bound to `bookmark-set' and `bmkp-bookmark-set-confirm-overwrite'
;;  (from library `Bookmark+') are remapped in Icicle mode to
;;  `icicle-bookmark-cmd'.
;;
;;  * With no prefix argument or a plain prefix argument (`C-u'), `C-x
;;    r m' acts like `icicle-bookmark-set'.  This is similar to
;;    `bookmark-set', but if you use `Bookmark+' then you can use
;;    (lax) completion, choosing from existing bookmarks for the same
;;    buffer.  This makes it easy to update a nearby bookmark.
;;
;;    The same completion enhancements are available as for bookmark
;;    jumping - see (@> "Jumping to a Bookmark"), below.
;;
;;  * With a negative prefix argument, `C-x r m' jumps to a bookmark
;;    (with completion).  See (@> "Jumping to a Bookmark"), below.
;;
;;  * With a non-negative prefix argument, `C-x r m' sets a bookmark,
;;    automatically naming it.  This is like the automatic naming for
;;    a region bookmark, except that instead of including a prefix of
;;    the region text, the name includes text from the current line
;;    that starts at point.
;;
;;    So if the cursor in buffer `foo' is on the `y' in a line with
;;    the text "Arise, you wretched of the earth!", then the bookmark
;;    will automatically be named `foo: you wretch'.
;;
;;    If the prefix argument is 0, then the new bookmark does not
;;    overwrite any existing bookmark with the same name.
;;
;;(@* "Jumping to a Bookmark")
;;  ** Jumping to a Bookmark **
;;
;;  Icicles commands that jump to a bookmark are multi-commands: you
;;  can use them to jump to any number of bookmarks in a single
;;  invocation.  Each jump command acts as a bookmark browser.
;;
;;  As with most Icicles tripping commands, after you jump to a
;;  (non-region) bookmark, the cursor position is highlighted using
;;  cross hairs, if you also use library `crosshairs.el'.
;;
;;  Bookmark names are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' to
;;  indicate the bookmark type.  The faces used are those defined by
;;  `Bookmark+'.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' is non-`nil', then
;;  each completion candidate is a multi-completion, with up to three
;;  parts: the bookmark name, the bookmark file or buffer name, and
;;  any (del.icio.us-style) tags the bookmark has.  You can toggle
;;  option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' (for the next command)
;;  using `M-m' during completion.
;;
;;  When using multi-completion candidates, you can match any of the
;;  multi-completion parts.  For example, you can match all bookmarks
;;  that have any tags by typing this when choosing a bookmark:
;;
;;    C-M-j . * C-M-j S-TAB
;;
;;  Or match all bookmarks whose names match `P42' and whose tags
;;  match `blue':
;;
;;    P 4 2 . * C-M-j . * C-M-j . * b l u e S-TAB
;;
;;  (Each `C-M-j' inserts `^G\n', which is `icicle-list-join-string'.)
;;
;;  `C-M-RET' shows detailed info about the current bookmark
;;  completion candidate.  `C-u C-M-RET' shows the complete, internal
;;  info for the bookmark.  Likewise, for the other candidate help
;;  keys: `C-M-down' etc.  And the mode line always shows summary
;;  info about the current bookmark.
;;
;;  During bookmark completion you can sort the candidates in various
;;  bookmark-specific ways:
;;
;;  * By the current (latest) `*Bookmark List*' order
;;  * By bookmark name
;;  * By last access as a bookmark (date + time)
;;  * By bookmark visit frequency (number of times visited)
;;  * By last buffer or file access (date + time)
;;  * With marked bookmarks before unmarked (in `*Bookmark List*')
;;  * By file name
;;  * By (local) file type
;;  * By (local) file size
;;  * By last (local) file access (date + time)
;;  * By last (local) file update (date + time)
;;  * By Info location (manual and node)
;;  * By Gnus thread
;;  * By URL
;;  * By bookmark type
;;
;;  The most general Icicles jump commands are `icicle-bookmark' and
;;  `icicle-bookmark-other-window'.  In Icicle mode these are bound to
;;  whatever `bookmark-jump' and `bookmark-jump-other-window' are
;;  normally bound to.  If you use `Bookmark+', the default bindings
;;  are `C-x j j' and `C-x 4 j j', respectively.
;;
;;  When you use these commands, you can narrow the completion
;;  candidates to bookmarks of a specific type using the following
;;  keys.
;;
;;  `C-x j b'   - non-file (buffer) bookmarks
;;  `C-x j B'   - bookmark-list bookmarks
;;  `C-x j d'   - Dired bookmarks
;;  `C-x j f'   - file bookmarks
;;  `C-x j . f' - file bookmarks for the current directory
;;  `C-x j g'   - Gnus bookmarks
;;  `C-x j i'   - Info bookmarks
;;  `C-x j M-i' - image bookmarks
;;  `C-x j K'   - desktop bookmarks
;;  `C-x j l'   - local-file bookmarks
;;  `C-x j m'   - `man' pages
;;  `C-x j n'   - remote-file bookmarks
;;  `C-x j r'   - bookmarks with regions
;;  `C-x j u'   - URL bookmarks
;;  `C-x j w'   - W3M (URL) bookmarks
;;  `C-x j x'   - temporary bookmarks
;;  `C-x j y'   - bookmark-file bookmarks
;;  `C-x j , ,' - bookmarks for the current buffer
;;  `C-x j = b' - bookmarks for specific buffers
;;  `C-x j = f' - bookmarks for specific files
;;
;;  These same keys are used at the top level for individual jump
;;  commands for bookmarks of each of each type.  For example,
;;  `icicle-bookmark-info' is bound to `C-x j i'.  Other-window jump
;;  commands are the same, but use the prefix key `C-x 4 j' instead of
;;  `C-x j'.
;;
;;  Commands `icicle-bookmark' and `icicle-bookmark-other-window' can
;;  use a cache for the set of available bookmarks.  This improves
;;  performance, especially if you have a lot of bookmarks.  The
;;  downside is that the list of completion candidates is not
;;  automatically updated when you add new bookmarks.
;;
;;  By default, this caching is off, so the set of possible bookmark
;;  candidates is always up-to-date.  You can turn on this caching by
;;  setting option `icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag' to `nil'.
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can use a prefix argument to reverse the effect
;;  of this option.  If you have a lot of bookmarks then I recommend
;;  that you customize the option to `nil' and just update it
;;  occasionally by using `C-u' for bookmark completion.  That will
;;  temporarily turn off caching so that the current jump command
;;  refreshes (updates) the cache.  The default value of the option is
;;  `t' only to avoid confusion for new users.
;;
;;  The bookmarks cache is also used for searching bookmarks (see
;;  next).  The type-specific bookmark jump commands
;;  (e.g. `icicle-bookmark-info-other-window') do not use the cache,
;;  since they typically use a smaller number of candidates.  And the
;;  cache is automatically updated whenever you use `S-delete' to
;;  delete a candidate bookmark.

;;(@* "Searching Bookmarked Objects")
;;  ** Searching Bookmarked Objects **
;;
;;  Icicles search (and replace) lets you search across multiple
;;  buffers, files, or bookmarks.  This is true for nearly all Icicles
;;  search commands.  You use a plain prefix argument to specify
;;  bookmark searching.  For command `icicle-search' itself (`C-u C-c
;;  `'), you can alternatively use the specific command
;;  `icicle-search-bookmarks-together'.
;;
;;  When you do this you first choose the bookmarks to search, using
;;  completion.  Use `C-RET' and similar multi-command actions to
;;  choose (use `RET' for the final choice).  Once you have chosen the
;;  bookmarks, you type a search pattern to narrow the set of
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  (Multi-command `icicle-bookmark-list' similarly lets you choose
;;  bookmarks (or bookmark names, with a prefix argument).  It returns
;;  them in a Lisp list.)
;;
;;  When you search the text of a region bookmark, the search is
;;  limited to the region.
;;
;;  If you use library `Bookmark+', then marking bookmarks in buffer
;;  `*Bookmark List*' is another way of choosing them for searching.
;;  Mode-specific Icicles search, `M-s M-s m' (in this case,
;;  `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked') searches the marked objects,
;;  in this case the targets of the marked bookmarks.  (You can
;;  similarly use `M-s M-s m' in Ibuffer, Buffer Menu, and Dired to
;;  search all marked buffers/files using Icicles search.)
;;
;;  In addition to using Icicles search on a set of bookmark targets
;;  together, you can use the following Icicles search multi-commands
;;  that are specific to bookmarks:
;;
;;  * icicle-search-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-autofile-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-bookmark-list-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-dired-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-file-bookmark

;;  * icicle-search-all-tags-regexp-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-some-tags-bookmark
;;  * icicle-search-some-tags-regexp-bookmark
;;
;;  `icicle-search-bookmark' is a general command; the others are each
;;  specific to a certain kind of bookmark candidate, and they need
;;  library `bookmark+.el'.  The last four let you search bookmarks
;;  that have a certain set of tags.
;;
;;  All of these commands act the same way.  They are multi-commands,
;;  so you can use them to search multiple bookmarks.  But unlike
;;  `icicle-search-bookmarks-together' (`C-u C-c `') and
;;  `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked' (`M-s M-s m'), you do not
;;  first choose the bookmarks and then search them together.
;;  Instead, you search them one at a time, choosing each with a
;;  multi-command action.
;;
;;  `icicle-search-bookmark' is flexible, letting you specify any set
;;  of bookmarks to use as candidates.  The candidates are the
;;  bookmarks last shown in the `*Bookmark List*' display (list
;;  `bmkp-sorted-alist', to be precise).
;;
;;  You can use the `Bookmark+' features of `*Bookmark List*' to limit
;;  the candidates to bookmarks of a certain type (e.g., only
;;  autofiles, using `A S'), bookmarks with certain tags (e.g., only
;;  those with tags matching a regexp using `T m %' followed by `>'),
;;  and so on.  Whatever set of bookmarks are shown (or were last
;;  shown) in `*Bookmark List*' are the bookmarks to be searched.

;;
;;  When you use an Icicles command that reads a bookmark name, you
;;  can use `C-S-RET' (`icicle-candidate-alt-action') to apply a
;;  function to any property of the current bookmark candidate.  You
;;  are prompted for the property and the function.
;;
;;  You choose the target property using completion from among those
;;  available for the current bookmark candidate.  Remember that you
;;  can use `C-M-RET' to see a description of the bookmark, which
;;  typically describes its most important properties.
;;
;;  You can choose any function symbol using completion, or you can
;;  enter a lambda expression.  The function chosen must accept the
;;  particular property value or else you will see an error message.
;;
;;  The value returned by the function is pretty-printed.  If the
;;  function you choose is `identity' then the action just
;;  pretty-prints the property value, which can be useful, even if
;;  trivial.

;;(@* "Icicles Enhancements for Emacs Tags")
;;
;;  Icicles Enhancements for Emacs Tags
;;  -----------------------------------
;;
;;  In Emacs and Icicles, the word "tag" is used in multiple ways.
;;  This section is about tags as identifiers of source-code
;;  definitions.  Emacs uses tags files, typically named `TAGS', to
;;  index these definition locations.
;;
;;  What constitutes a "definition" is determined by the content of
;;  the tags file.  Typically, definition recognition is available for
;;  programming languages, but in fact a tags table can record any
;;  text at all as a definition.  That is, if you create your own tags
;;  table, you can use the Emacs tags feature to navigate among any
;;  "definitions" of your own choosing.
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle option
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate when using any of the Icicles tags
;;  browsing commands described here.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").

;;(@* "`icicle-find-tag': Find Tags in All Tags Tables")
;;  ** `icicle-find-tag': Find Tags in All Tags Tables **
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, you use commands such as `find-tag' (`M-.') to
;;  find a tag, `tags-loop-continue' (`M-,') to find another matching
;;  tag, `tags-apropos' to list all tags that match a regexp, and
;;  `list-tags' to show all tags (definitions) in a given source file.
;;
;;  In Icicles, you can use multi-command `icicle-find-tag', bound to
;;  `M-.' in Icicle mode, to do all of this.  It is similar to the
;;  Icicles search commands.  It is a general tags browser, just as
;;  `icicle-imenu' is an Imenu browser.  Being a multicommand, you can
;;  visit any number of tags, in any order, in a single `M-.'
;;  invocation.
;;
;;  With `icicle-find-tag', you enter (using `RET') a regexp to match
;;  the tags you want to visit.  By default, all tags in all tags
;;  files are searched, and the matches become completion candidates
;;  (which you can of course match further by typing another pattern).
;;  As always, you can use progressive completion, chip away the
;;  non-elephant, and so on.  Just as with Icicles search commands,
;;  you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', and so on, to visit the
;;  search hits.  You can use `M-*' (`icicle-pop-mark') to return to
;;  the place you invoked `M-.'.
;;
;;  By default, the completion candidates are multi-completions: the
;;  source file name is included.  This is an important aid, because
;;  there can be similar, or even identical, tags in different source
;;  files.  Your current input can of course filter the source-file
;;  name also, excluding certain files from the search.
;;
;;  A prefix argument  changes the default behavior, as follows:
;;
;;  * If non-negative (>= 0), then only the current tag table is used,
;;    instead of all tag tables.
;;
;;  * If non-positive (<= 0), then the source file name is not part of
;;    the completion candidate; only the tag itself is used.

;;  use an Icicles bookmark-jump multi-command to navigate among those
;;  bookmarks.
;;
;;  For (a), just define a function that creates or sets a bookmark
;;  that has the same name as an Emacs tag.  Then use that function on

;;    It is documented not here but in section
;;    (@> "Completion in Comint Modes").
;;
;;  * In any buffer, it provides Icicles completion for `M-!' and
;;    `M-|'.  This is an optional feature that is not enabled by
;;    default.
;;
;;  * In Dired mode, it provides Icicles completion for `!', and `&'.

;;  `M-!' or `M-|', no completion is available for empty input, and
;;  non-empty input is completed only to an environment variable or to
;;  a shell command that is in your search path.  For Emacs releases
;;  prior to Emacs 23, vanilla Emacs offers no completion at all.
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `M-!' and `M-|' can, like vanilla Emacs (23 and
;;  later), complete using commands in your search path.  This depends
;;  on the the value of option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' (see
;;  below).
;;
;;(@* "Shell Command Completion as File-Name Completion")
;;  ** Shell Command Completion as File-Name Completion **
;;
;;  The most significant thing about Icicles completion for reading a
;;  shell command is that it is in fact *file-name* completion.
;;  Reading a shell command means, first, reading a file name.  This
;;  is unexpected, to say the least.
;;
;;  Because of this unusual behavior, this feature is optional and is
;;  not enabled by default.  To enable it, customize option
;;  `icicle-functions-to-redefine' to add the shell-related functions
;;  `dired-read-shell-command' and `read-shell-command'.  If you do
;;  that, then Icicle mode will substitute Icicles functions for these
;;  standard functions and you will get the Icicles completion
;;  described here.
;;
;;  A shell command is itself an executable file, either a binary
;;  program or a script.  That's not so shocking.  But since Icicles
;;  uses file-name completion for your entire shell-command input,
;;  including any switches (options) and command arguments, all of
;;  that input is interpreted by `read-file-name' as a file name,
;;  before it gets passed on to the shell.
;;
;;  The reason for optionally providing file-name completion for a
;;  shell command is to let you easily invoke a program no matter
;;  where it resides, whether or not its directory is in your search
;;  path.  You can use completion to navigate to the command's
;;  location.
;;
;;  Icicles shell-command completion is lax, so you can enter any
;;  command you want, not just a file-name completion candidate.  And
;;  you can edit the completed input before hitting `RET', to add
;;  command switches (options) and arguments.  The overall input
;;  string is taken as a (pseudo) file name, but it is then passed to
;;  the shell for execution.
;;
;;  One drawback to this approach of using file-name completion is
;;  that the history list is the file-name history, not the history of
;;  previous shell commands.
;;
;;(@* "Gotcha: `$' in Shell Commands")
;;  ** Gotcha: `$' in Shell Commands **
;;
;;  There is a gotcha, however, regarding `$' and file-name input:
;;
;;  When you hit `RET' to accept the input, `read-file-name' finishes
;;  its job, as always, by trying to expand any environment variables
;;  in the string.  Usually this is what you want, and it presents no
;;  problem.  But in the context of a shell another `$' syntax is also
;;  used.  For example, `$1' typically means the first argument or
;;  first field; it does not mean a variable named `1'.
;;
;;  `read-file-name' knows nothing about this different `$' syntax,
;;  and it systematically calls `substitute-in-file-name' to expand
;;  any environment variables in the file name you enter (when you hit
;;  `RET').  It interprets `$1' the same way it inteprets `$PATH',
;;  treating `1' as an (unknown) environment variable.  This is not
;;  what you want it to do.  If you input `awk '{print $1}' Emacs
;;  raises this error:
;;
;;    Substituting nonexistent environment variable "1"
;;
;;  What can you do about this?  Three possible approaches:
;;
;;  * Do not use this Icicles feature at all.  The feature is turned
;;    off, by default.
;;
;;  * You can escape a dollar sign by doubling it: use `$$' instead of
;;    `$' when you want to pass a `$' to the shell and not let
;;    `read-file-name' try to interpret it in terms of an environment
;;    variable.
;;
;;  * You can turn off Icicle mode temporarily whenever you use a
;;    complex command that involves `$': `M-x icy-mode'.
;;
;;(@* "Known Shell Commands as Proxy Candidates")
;;  ** Known Shell Commands as Proxy Candidates **
;;
;;  If you do turn on Icicles file-name completion for reading shell
;;  commands, then extra, known shell commands are also made available
;;  as proxy completion candidates, provided that option
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-`nil' (it is `nil' by
;;  default).  These extra candidates are the names of all executable
;;  files (or of all files, if `shell-completion-execonly' is `nil')
;;  in your search path.
;;
;;  The fact that these are Icicles proxy candidates means that they
;;  are available regardless of the current default-directory - they
;;  are not in fact treated as file-name candidates, even though they
;;  are available during file-name completion.  You can easily
;;  recognize Icicles proxy candidates in buffer `*Completions*': they
;;  have face `icicle-proxy-candidates'.  See 
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "*Completions* Display").
;;
;;  If `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-`nil', the list of
;;  search-path candidate commands is computed once and cached as the
;;  value of `icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache'.  The particular
;;  non-`nil' value of `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' determines when
;;  the cache is filled.
;;
;;  If the value of `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is `first-use',
;;  the cache is filled the first time you use it, and each time you
;;  turn on Icicle mode it is updated.  If the value of
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is `load', then the cache is
;;  instead filled each time you load Icicles.
;;
;;  Regardless of the non-`nil' value of
;;  `icicle-guess-commands-in-path', if you save
;;  `icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache', then that value is used
;;  in future sessions (no delay for searching your path).
;;
;;  If your environment changes, you can use command
;;  `icicle-recompute-shell-command-candidates' to update the cached
;;  list at any time.  With a prefix argument, the updated value is
;;  saved persistently.
;;
;;  In addition to the extra candidates computed by searching your
;;  search path, in contexts such as Dired where target (e.g. marked)
;;  files for the shell command are known, the extra candidates
;;  include additional commands (possibly including switches) that
;;  Icicles can guess might be appropriate for the target files.
;;  See (@> "Shell Commands on Marked Files").
;;
;;  During Icicles shell-command completion, help is available for
;;  individual candidates, using `C-M-RET', `C-M-mouse-2', and so on.
;;  For an extra candidate, help is provided for the command by the
;;  `apropos' shell command (if available).  For a file-name
;;  candidate, help shows the file's properties.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Get Help on Completion Candidates").
;;
;;(@* "Using On-Demand Completion with Shell-Command Input")
;;  ** Using On-Demand Completion with Shell-Command Input **
;;
;;  Even if you do not choose to turn on the file-name completion
;;  feature described above, you can still get file-name completion
;;  when you input a shell command.  Just do it on the fly, using
;;  `C-M-S-f' (aka `C-M-F').
;;
;;  After you have typed or completed the shell command per se (e.g. a
;;  file name or a search-path command), you can use `C-M-F' to
;;  complete (relative) file names to insert as shell-command
;;  arguments as part of the command line to submit to the shell.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Completion On Demand").
;;
;;  In addition, remember that you can use `M-o' anytime in the
;;  minibuffer to complete against a previous input.  This means that
;;  if you have previously entered some complex shell command
;;  (e.g. with various switches or arguments), then you can use `M-o'
;;  to retrieve it for reuse (possibly editing it).  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Using Completion to Insert Previous Inputs: `M-o'")
;;
;;  In addition, you can use `C-M-pause' to switch to another history,
;;  then use `M-o' to complete against that history.  And you can do
;;  this as many times as you like during the same overall
;;  shell-command input.  You can thus use different histories to
;;  compose different parts of the overall command.  See
;;  (@> "Using Other Histories; Commands Any Which Way").
;;
;;  None of this is special to shell-command input.  `C-M-F',
;;  `C-M-pause', and `M-o' are all available in Icicle mode for any
;;  minibuffer input.
 
;;(@* "Icicles Dired Enhancements")
;;
;;  Icicles Dired Enhancements
;;  --------------------------
;;
;;  This section describes enhancements to Dired behavior, that is,
;;  things you can do in Dired.  In addition, be aware also of the
;;  other direction: during file-name completion you can use `M-|' to
;;  open all of the matching files in a Dired buffer.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Open Dired for a Set of File and Dir Names"), below,
;;  which opens Dired for a set of file names that you have saved
;;  (persistently or not) during Icicles completion.  That lets you
;;  reuse the same set of file names multiple times for Dired.
;;
;;  Icicles can help with Dired in these ways:
;;
;;  * Commands `dired' and `dired-other-window' are multi-commands.
;;    If you use library `Dired+' (`dired+.el') then these commands
;;    are particularly powerful.
;
;;  * You can use Icicles search-and-replace on the marked files in
;;    the current directory and in marked subdirectories
;;    (recursively).
;;
;;  * You can save marked file names as completion candidates for
;;    reuse later.
;;
;;  * You can open Dired on saved file names, that is, names that you
;;    previously saved as a completion candidates set or as an Emacs
;;    fileset.  It does not matter how the file names were saved or
;;    which directories the files are in.  The set of saved file names
;;    can be persistent or just for the current Emacs session.
;;
;;  * You can use multi-command `icicle-dired-insert-as-subdir' to
;;    insert directories you choose into a Dired ancestor directory
;;    listing.  If a directory you choose already has its own Dired
;;    buffer, then its markings and switches are preserved for the
;;    new, subdirectory listing in the ancestor Dired buffer.
;;
;;  * You can use file-name completion when you use `!'  or `&' to
;;    execute a shell command.  This is an optional feature that is
;;    not enabled by default.  See also (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").
;;
;;  * You can use the multi-completion multi-commands
;;    `icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content' and
;;    `icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content-other-window' to visit
;;    marked files whose names and/or whose content matches your
;;    minibuffer input.  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Completions").
;;
;;(@* "Search-and-Replace Marked Files")
;;  ** Search-and-Replace Marked Files **
;;
;;  If you also use library `Dired+' then you can use command
;;  `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive' to use Icicles search (and
;;  on-demand replacement) on the marked files.
;;
;;  Each marked subdirectory is handled recursively in the same way:
;;  If it has a Dired buffer then its marked files are searched, or
;;  all of its files if none are marked.  If a marked directory at any
;;  level has no Dired buffer then all of its files are searched.
;;  With a prefix argument the Dired markings are ignored; all files
;;  are searched.
;;
;;  Because you might not be aware of existing Dired buffers for some
;;  marked directories, you are asked to confirm searching their
;;  marked files.  If you do not confirm, then all files in marked
;;  subdirectories (recursively) are searched, regardless of whether
;;  they might have Dired buffers with marked files.  That is, Dired
;;  buffers are ignored if you do not confirm using them.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive' runs
;;  `icicle-search', so you have available all of its features,
;;  including accessing search hits directly, in any order.  To skip a
;;  whole file, just match its name with your minibuffer input and
;;  then use `C-~' to remove all of its occurrences from the set of
;;  hits.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive' is the
;;  mode-specific Icicles search command for Dired mode.  As such, it
;;  is bound to `M-s M-s m', `M-0 M-s M-s M-s', and `C-0 C-c `'.  Like
;;  all `Dired+' recursive-marks commands, it is also on prefix key
;;  `M-+', as `M-+ C-S-s' (aka `M-+ C-S').
;;
;;  There is a similar command, `icicle-search-dired-marked', which
;;  searches only the files marked in the current directory.  It does
;;  not recurse to pick up the files marked in marked descendent
;;  directories.  It is bound to `C-S-s', aka `C-S'.
;;
;;  There are two simpler Icicles search commands similar to these,
;;  `icicle-occur-dired-marked-recursive' and
;;  `icicle-occur-dired-marked', bound to `M-s M-s M' or `M-+ C-S-o'
;;  (aka `M-+ C-O') and `C-S-o' (aka `C-O'), respectively.  These run
;;  `icicle-occur' on the marked files, which means that the search
;;  contexts are the lines in the files (similar to `grep').
;;
;;  [`M-s M-s m' is the key sequence for mode-specific Icicles search.
;;  You can similarly use it in Ibuffer or Buffer Menu to search all
;;  marked buffers using Icicles search, and in your bookmark list
;;  (buffer `*Bookmark List*') to search all marked bookmark targets
;;  (you need library `Bookmark+' for this).  Also, `M-0 M-s M-s M-s'
;;  and `C-0 C-c `' are bound to the same command.  (But you cannot
;;  pass a separate prefix argument in those cases, since `C-0' is
;;  already used.)]
;;
;;(@* "Save Marked Names as Completion Candidates")
;;  ** Save Marked Names as Completion Candidates **
;;
;;  In Dired with Icicles, you can use `C-M->'
;;  (`icicle-dired-save-marked') to save the marked file and
;;  subdirectory names as a set of completion candidates, for reuse
;;  later (e.g., using `C-M-<').  Similarly, you can use `C->' to add
;;  the marked files to an existing saved set of candidates.
;;
;;  These bindings act similarly to `C-M->' and `C->' in the
;;  minibuffer: a prefix argument controls whether you save candidates
;;  to a variable or a cache file.  Also, `C-M-}' saves to a variable
;;  you name, and `C-}' saves to a cache file - see
;;  (@* "Marked Files and Dirs as a Project"), below.
;;
;;  You can use such a saved set of file and directory names as
;;  candidates during file-name completion.  They are saved as
;;  absolute names, which means you can use them with, say, `C-u C-x
;;  C-f'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Absolute File Names and Different Directories").
;;
;;(@* "Save Marked Names Here and Below")
;;  *** Save Marked Names Here and Below ***
;;
;;  Just as `M-s M-s m' acts on the marked names in not only the
;;  current Dired buffer but also those in marked subdirectories,
;;  recursively (see (@> "Search-and-Replace Marked Files")), so there
;;  are commands to save the marked names at all levels within the
;;  current directory.  These commands are available only if you use
;;  library `Dired+'.
;;
;;  They have the same key bindings as the non-recursive commands,
;;  except that they are on prefix key `M-+'.  For example, `M-+
;;  C-M->' saves the marked names here and below as a set of
;;  completion candidates.  They are available on Dired menu-bar menu
;;  `Multiple' > `Marked Here and Below' > `Icicles'.
;;
;;(@* "Open Dired for a Set of File and Dir Names")
;;  ** Open Dired for a Set of File and Dir Names **
;;
;;  In Dired with Icicles you can use `C-M-<'
;;  (`icicle-dired-chosen-files-other-window') to open Dired for a set
;;  of file or directory names that you choose interactively or that
;;  you have previously saved (persistently or not) as completion
;;  candidates or as an Emacs fileset.
;;
;;  For example, this opens Dired on all files whose names match the
;;  regexp `.*foo.*bar' (the initial `.*' is implicit):
;;
;;    C-M-<  foo.*bar  S-TAB  C-!  C-g
;;
;;  The Dired buffer that is created is named `Icy File Set' (suffixed
;;  with <1>, <2>, etc. as needed), and it contains only the chosen
;;  file names.
;;
;;  The file names are checked to be sure they reference existing
;;  files.  If any of the names are relative names, those files are
;;  checked for existence in the Dired directory.  If you use a prefix
;;  argument, then you are prompted for the directory to use.
;;
;;(@* "Marked Files and Dirs as a Project")
;;  ** Marked Files and Dirs as a Project **
;;
;;  Just as `C-}' in the minibuffer is a shortcut for `C-u C-M->',
;;  which saves the current set of completion candidates persistently,
;;  so `C-}' in Dired saves the marked file names in a cache file or,
;;  with a prefix argument, an Emacs fileset.  Similarly, just as
;;  `C-{' in the minibuffer is a shortcut for `C-u C-M-<', which
;;  retrieves candidates from a persistent set, so `C-{' in Dired
;;  retrieves a persistent set of file names and opens them in a
;;  separate Dired buffer.
;;
;;  You can think of such persistent file-name sets as projects.
;;  `C-}' is bound to command `icicle-dired-save-marked-as-project'
;;  (aka `icicle-dired-save-marked-persistently').  `C-{' is bound to
;;  command `icicle-dired-project-other-window'.
;;
;;  Again, you can use such a project as a candidate set for file-name
;;  completion at any time.  In addition, `C-}' and `C-{' can be handy
;;  in Dired for working with projects even without using completion.
;;  The files in a project can be distributed among any directories
;;  anywhere.  This gives you an easy way to open Dired on just the
;;  files you want and operate on them there.
;;
;;  And while in a project in Dired you can use `C-M-<' to mark a
;;  project subset to work on, and then use `C-M->' to operate on that
;;  subset using Icicles completion.  And you can have any number of
;;  projects - you access each by its name (with completion) and need
;;  not remember its cache file name.
;;
;;(@* "Shell Commands on Marked Files")
;;  ** Shell Commands on Marked Files **
;;
;;  This is an optional feature that is not enabled by default.  See
;;  also (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `!' and `&' in Dired let you complete a shell
;;  command.  You can optionally use Icicles file-name completion for
;;  the shell command, by customizing option
;;  `icicle-functions-to-redefine' to add the shell-related functions
;;  `dired-read-shell-command' and `read-shell-command'.
;;
;;  If you do that, then Icicle mode will substitute Icicles functions
;;  for these standard functions and you will get the Icicles
;;  completion described here.  This is the same optional program-file
;;  completion that is available anywhere when a shell command is read
;;  (see (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements")), but in Dired the
;;  extra, proxy candidates include commands that Icicles thinks might
;;  be particularly appropriate for the marked files.
;;
;;  These proxy candidates are not necessarily only command names.
;;  They can include switches (options) that specialize a command.
;;  For example, if a PDF file (*.pdf) is marked in Dired, the
;;  completion candidates might include `gv -safer', `pdftotext ?  -',
;;  and `xpdf'.  The first two of these are not just command names
;;  (`-safer' is a command switch).
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 23, Icicles uses both of the following methods
;;  to guess extra (proxy) candidates that are file type-specific:
;;
;;  * MIME-type associations
;;
;;  * The rules defined by user option `dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
;;    and variable `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' (provided you use
;;    Dired X, that is, standard library `dired-x.el')
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 23, MIME types are not used.  In the example of a
;;  PDF file, candidates `gv -safer' and `pdftotext ? -' are provided
;;  by MIME-type associations, and candidate `xpdf' is provided by the
;;  Dired X rules.  Note that you can customize the rules.
;;
;;  Any candidates that are specific to the marked files are Icicles
;;  proxy candidates - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "*Completions* Display").
;;  These are available regardless of the current default-directory.
;;  They are not treated as file-name candidates, even though they are
;;  available during file-name completion.  Icicles proxy candidates
;;  have face `icicle-proxy-candidates' in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  Again, everything that is true for shell-command completion
;;  elsewhere is also true for shell-command completion in Dired.  See
;;  (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").  This includes adding
;;  all commands from your search path as proxy candidates if option

;;
;;  Icicles Info Enhancements
;;  -------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles can help with Info in these ways:
;;
;;  * Icicles completion is available for any input.
;;
;;  * Index-topic completion highlights candidate topics that
;;    reference nodes you have already visited.
;;
;;  * You can create virtual Info books composed of an arbitrary set
;;    of nodes from any set of manuals.
;;
;;  * You can easily find nodes that contain text matching a
;;    combination of patterns.
;;
;;  * You can use `icicle-search' on part or all of a manual, if you
;;    flatten it first with `Info-merge-subnodes' .
;;
;;  These features are described below.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles Completion for Info")
;;  ** Icicles Completion for Info **
;;
;;  Whenever completion is available for Info commands, such as `g'
;;  (`Info-goto-node'), `i' (`Info-index'), and `m' (`Info-menu'), you
;;  can take advantage of Icicles completion.  For instance, if you
;;  type `g yan', you can use `S-TAB' for apropos completion and
;;  choose node `Isearch Yank', whose name contains `yan' but does not
;;  start with it.  This is an obvious and standard Icicles feature.
;;
;;  Although vanilla Emacs also accepts a substring as input for `i',
;;  it does not provide regexp completion, and it will not accept a
;;  regexp as final input.
;;
;;  Icicle mode binds `g', `i', and `m' to multi-commands
;;  `icicle-Info-goto-node', `icicle-Info-index', and
;;  `icicle-Info-menu', which means that you can also use `g', `i',
;;  and `m' with `C-next', `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', and so on, to browse
;;  among matching Info nodes.  Unlike browsing with repeated use of
;;  `,' after `i' in vanilla Emacs, you can continue to see all of the
;;  matching candidates, in buffer `*Completions*', and you need not
;;  visit the index hits in sequential order.
;;
;;  If you use `M-g' in the minibuffer to toggle
;;  `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', then you can use just `next'
;;  instead of `C-next' to navigate.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'").
;;
;;  As usual in Icicles, you can sort completion candidates in various
;;  ways, using `C-,' (`icicle-change-sort-order').  For `g', in
;;  particular, although the default order is alphabetical, you can
;;  choose `in book order', which shows the node candidates in the
;;  same order as in the book.  In that case, using `g' and then
;;  navigating among candidates sequentially using `C-down', `C-up',
;;  `C-next', `C-prior', `C-end', or `C-home', visits the nodes in
;;  their natural order.
;;
;;  As a special case of this, if you use a negative prefix argument
;;  (that is, `M-- g'), then not only are the candidate nodes
;;  presented `in book order', they are also limited to the nodes that
;;  follow your current location in the book - that is, to the
;;  remainder of the book.  (A non-negative numeric prefix argument
;;  has the same meaning as for `Info-goto-node'.)
;;
;;  In addition, except when you are at the `Top' node, a pseudo-node
;;  `..' is added to the set of completion candidates.  Choosing this
;;  takes you up to the parent of the current node.  You can thus use
;;  `g' in Info not only to explore nodes by name, but also as another
;;  means to traverse the Info menu hierarchy.
;;
;;(@* "Highlighting Index Topics for Visited Info Nodes")
;;  ** Highlighting Index Topics for Visited Info Nodes **
;;
;;  When you are looking for something in an Info manual, `i'
;;  (multi-command `icicle-Info-index') is your friend.  It is
;;  typically better than brute search (`C-s' or `C-M-s'), because a
;;  human has decided what topics to add to the index based on
;;  understanding user/reader needs.
;;
;;  When you use `i' to look up a topic in the indexes of a manual,
;;  you can use completion.  In particular, apropos completion and
;;  progressive completion can help here.
;;
;;  Naturally, a single Info node can be indexed under multiple
;;  topics.  And some of those index entries might even represent the
;;  same topic, using different word order or terminology.
;;
;;  Suppose you are looking up information about Emacs fringe, for
;;  example.  You might type `i fringe S-TAB' to see all indexed
;;  topics with the substring `fringe'.  But because of double-entry
;;  indexing, several of the topics matching your input can take you
;;  to the same node.
;;
;;  When you are investigating a topic this way you might want to
;;  visit different nodes that are pertinent to the same topic.  But
;;  how can you tell whether you have already visited a node that one
;;  of the matching topic candidates takes you to?  Icicles
;;  highlighting of past inputs does not help here.  What matters is
;;  not whether you have entered a given topic previously but whether
;;  you have already visited a given topic's node.
;;
;;  Icicles can also help here, by highlighting the topics whose nodes
;;  you have visited.  It uses face
;;  `icicle-historical-candidate-other' for this (not face
;;  `icicle-historical-candidate').  (This feature is not available
;;  for Emacs 20 or 21.)
;;
;;  This highlighting can be automatic, or you can effect it on demand
;;  using `C-x C-M-l'.  Because it takes extra time to track down each
;;  of the current topic candidates, this highlighting can be costly.
;;  You can customize option `icicle-Info-highlight-visited-nodes' to
;;  allow and control automatic highlighting.  It is turned off
;;  (`nil') by default.  Even when the option value is non-`nil',
;;  automatic highlighting does not occur if you turn off historical
;;  candidate highlighting altogether, by setting option
;;  `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag' to `nil'.
;;
;;(@* "Virtual Info Books")
;;  ** Virtual Info Books **
;;
;;  You can take advantage of Icicles completion-candidate set
;;  operations to create your own virtual Info books.  That is, you
;;  can define and save sets of Info nodes or Info index entries, and
;;  then reuse them later.
;;
;;  Both `m' and `g' in Info use nodes as candidates, so you can use
;;  `m' or `g' or a combination of `m' and `g' to define a node set,
;;  and you can use either `m' or `g' to reuse a node set.  A set of
;;  index entries is different: You must use `i' to create and reuse
;;  such a set.
;;
;;  Remember that you can define a candidate set incrementally, adding
;;  more elements using `C->', `C-)', `insert', `M-S-mouse-2',
;;  `M-mouse-3', or `mouse-1 mouse-3 mouse-3'.  And you can save a
;;  candidate set persistently. [*]
;;
;;  You can even create a virtual book that includes Info nodes from
;;  different manuals.  For example, you might want to collect
;;  together specific nodes that deal with some particular topic, such
;;  as faces, from both the Emacs manual and the Elisp manual.
;;
;;  You do this using `C-u g' (a plain prefix argument).  This
;;  prepends the Info file name (book identifier) to each node-name
;;  completion candidate.  For example, when you are in the Emacs
;;  manual, each node candidate is prefixed by `(emacs)', and in the
;;  Elisp manual each candidate is prefixed by `(elisp)'.  You define
;;  a set of candidates in the usual Icicles ways, changing manuals as
;;  needed to add additional nodes to the set you save.
;;
;;  A node name prefixed by its file name is analogous to an absolute
;;  file name, that is, a relative file name prefixed by its
;;  directory.  Because such a saved candidate has a book prefix,
;;  e.g. `(emacs)', it is absolute and unambiguous.  You can use it
;;  wherever you happen to be in Info, to go directly to that node.
;;  This is a feature of `g' even in vanilla Emacs: you can go to a
;;  node in a different manual from the one you are currently
;;  visiting.
;;
;;  When you want to reuse a virtual book, hit `g' again, retrieve the
;;  saved set of node candidates that defines the book, and navigate
;;  among the saved nodes.
;;
;;  If you use library `info+.el', you can also take advantage of its
;;  definition of virtual books and saved Info nodes.  That library
;;  defines command `Info-virtual-book', which opens Info on a Table
;;  of Contents of a virtual book of nodes that you have saved either
;;  using command `Info-save-current-node' or by customizing user
;;  option `Info-saved-nodes'.
;;
;;  Icicles command `icicle-Info-virtual-book' extends
;;  `Info-virtual-book' by letting you define the virtual book nodes
;;  using completion.  That is, you can use `g' to save a set of
;;  node-name completion candidates (as the value of variable
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-candidates'), and then use command
;;  `icicle-Info-virtual-book' to open an Info buffer with those nodes
;;  as a menu.
;;
;;  If you have not saved any node-name candidates, then
;;  `icicle-Info-virtual-book' acts the same as `Info-virtual-book':
;;  it opens the virtual book that is defined by `Info-saved-nodes'.
;;  With `info+.el', the key `.' adds the current node to
;;  `Info-saved-nodes', which gives you a convenient way to build up a
;;  virtual book as you read.  This is like Emacs bookmarking, but it
;;  keeps your saved Info nodes separate from your other bookmarks.
;;
;;  With a prefix argument, `icicle-Info-virtual-book' lets you choose
;;  a persistently saved completion set to use instead of
;;  `icicle-saved-completion-candidates' or `Info-saved-nodes'.  This
;;  means that you can have any number of such saved node sets as
;;  virtual books, to use at any time.
;;

;;
;;  [* If you click `mouse-1' on a candidate and (starting with Emacs
;;  22) `mouse-1-click-follows-link' is an integer, then you will need
;;  to hold the mouse button depressed longer than that many seconds,
;;  or else that candidate will simply by chosen.  If the value is
;;  `t', then this will not work at all.  Any other value presents no
;;  problem.  (Personally, I use `nil'.)]
;;
;;(@* "Finding Nodes Containing Some Text")
;;  ** Finding Nodes Containing Some Text **
;;
;;  In Icicle mode, `g' (command `icicle-Info-goto-node') lets you
;;  type multi-completion input whose second part (after `C-M-j') is a
;;  content-searching pattern (regexp).  This means you can search a
;;  set of nodes, or an entire manual, and choose from the list of
;;  matching nodes.  The `*Completions*' candidates you see are just
;;  the node names.
;;
;;  As always during Icicles completion, you can combine any number of
;;  search patterns (for both node name and content), using
;;  progressive completion.
;;
;;  After you choose one of the matching nodes to visit, you can use
;;  `C-M-s' to find each match of the content-search pattern.
;;
;;  See Also:

;;
;;(@* "Using Icicle-Search With Info")
;;  ** Using Icicle-Search With Info **
;;
;;  Icicles searching (`icicle-search') is not Isearch.  It searches
;;  for all matches in the portion of text you tell it to search.
;;  This means that you cannot use it to search an entire manual in
;;  one operation, unless you have the entire manual available in a
;;  single buffer to be searched.
;;
;;  So, when you use `icicle-search' (`C-c `') to search with Info,
;;  you are limited to a few options:
;;
;;  * You can use it normally, to search within a single Info node.
;;
;;  * You can widen the visible portion of the Info buffer
;;    (`C-x n w'), to use it on an entire Info file.  However:
;;
;;    1. It is not obvious how a given Info manual is divided into
;;       files.  That is, you need to be aware of the point at which
;;       the manual moves from one file to the next.
;;
;;    2. Only the nodes in the same file that you have already visited
;;       are highlighted, and lots of ugly Info "plumbing" becomes
;;       visible in the other nodes.
;;
;;    3. You lose all Info features, such as navigation using links.
;;
;;  * There is another way to search across nodes, which addresses #1
;;    and #2, but still does not give you navigable links and such.
;;    Think of it as a hack that can sometimes be handy.  That is what
;;    is described below.
;;
;;  The idea is to flatten a subtree of Info nodes - possibly an
;;  entire manual, but more typically a node and its children - and
;;  then use `icicle-search' (`C-c `') over that flattened document.
;;  What is needed is a command that flattens Info subtrees.  Library
;;  `info+.el' provides such a command, `Info-merge-subnodes', and
;;  binds it to `+' in Info.
;;
;;  You can control how you want the flattening to occur, by using
;;  different values of prefix argument.  For searching, you probably
;;  want complete flattening of the chosen subtree, in a single
;;  buffer, so you use a prefix argument of zero: `C-u 0 +'.
;;
;;  This does not replace the `*Info*' buffer that you started with;
;;  it creates a new buffer, named after the root node of the subtree
;;  you flattened.  A principle use of `Info-merge-subnodes' is to
;;  print out a manual or a portion of it.  Also, I wrote a library
;;  (`mkhtml.el', outdated now) that lets you convert the result to
;;  HTML.
;;
;;  In sum, you can use Icicles search in Info: `C-u 0 +', then
;;  `C-c `'.
;;
;;  One caveat, however: You will generally want to limit your search
;;  to a reasonably small subtree of a manual, instead of flattening
;;  and then searching the entire manual.  Flattening a large manual
;;  can take a while: it took me 10 minutes to flatten the Emacs
;;  Manual.  Of course, you could flatten a large manual once, and
;;  save the result in a file for later searches.
;;
;;  Obviously, flattening in order to search is less convenient than
;;  using manual-wide incremental search (`C-s') with Info (starting
;;  with Emacs 22), and it is often less convenient than using
;;  `Info-search' (bound to `s' in Info).  Icicles searching is
;;  different from both, and it has its advantages and disadvantages.
;;  When you want the advantages of Icicles searching in Info, the
;;  flattening hack can be useful.  When you do not need those
;;  advantages, other search methods can sometimes be more
;;  appropriate.

;;
;;  Icicles Support for Projects
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  This section mainly provides pointers to other sections of the
;;  Icicles doc that describe features that can help you work with a
;;  project that involves multiple files, buffers, or bookmarks.
;;
;;
;;(@* "Bookmarks for Project Access and Organization")
;;  ** Bookmarks for Project Access and Organization **
;;
;;  If you use `Bookmark+' (library `bookmark+.el'), then you can use
;;  bookmarks of various types, including the following, to help
;;  manage software projects:
;;
;;  * Dired buffers, with specific sets of files and subdirectories
;;    that are marked or omitted, and using specific listing switches.
;;
;;  * `*Bookmark List*' buffers, with specific sets of bookmarks that
;;    are marked or hidden.
;;
;;  * Multiple alternative bookmark files.  For example, use a
;;    different one for each project.  Or use different ones for
;;    subprojects and use them together for a full project.
;;
;;  * Desktops, which include sets of variables and visited buffers
;;    and files.
;;
;;  * Composite, or sequence, bookmarks, which combine other
;;    bookmarks.
;;
;;  You can also associate tags, in the del.icio.us sense, with most
;;  types of bookmarks.  (Such tags are unrelated to the Emacs
;;  source-code tags that use tags files.)  A bookmark can have any
;;  number of tags, and multiple bookmarks can have the same tag,
;;  which means you can use them to organize their target objects.
;;  And tags can be more than just names: they can be user-defined
;;  attributes, with Emacs-Lisp objects as their values.
;;
;;  These and other `Bookmark+' features give you different ways to
;;  save, restore, filter, access, and otherwise organize projects, as
;;  collections of information about source-code components and
;;  related software.
;;
;;  Icicles enhances access to such features.
;;  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;(@* "A Tags File Can Define a Project")
;;  ** A Tags File Can Define a Project **
;;
;;  One simple kind of a project includes the files that are in or
;;  under a single directory.  Such a project is limited, but it can
;;  often be useful, and it has the advantage of being supported by
;;  several existing Emacs features.
;;
;;  Another simple kind of project includes the files that are listed
;;  in a given Emacs tags file.  This is obviously more complex and
;;  flexible than a directory listing.
;;
;;  Icicles provides multi-commands for visiting one or more files
;;  that are listed in the current tags table:
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table' and
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table-other-window'.  See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Commands that Read File Names").
;;
;;(@* "Navigating Among Code Definitions")
;;  ** Navigating Among Code Definitions **
;;
;;  For software projects, you need to be able to navigate among code
;;  definitions.  Imenu and Emacs tags features are useful for this,
;;  as are `grep' and compilation buffers.  Icicles improves all of
;;  these.  (A tags file is just a saved index for project files.)
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@> "Icicles Imenu")
;;  * (@> "Icicles Enhancements for Emacs Tags")
;;  * (@> "Compile/Grep Search")
;;
;;(@* "Searching Project Files")
;;  ** Searching Project Files **
;;
;;  Searching within your project is another area where Icicles can
;;  help.  Icicles search is both search and navigation.  Navigating
;;  among tags definitions that match a regexp is also really
;;  searching, and the same is true for Imenu and grep navigation.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview") and its
;;  subsections for information about the many ways that you can use
;;  Icicles search to access parts of your projects.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Icicles Dired Enhancements") for an easy way to
;;  search marked files in Dired with Icicles search.
;;
;;  See also (@> "Searching Bookmarked Objects") for ways to search
;;  bookmarked objects, including the files that have a given set of
;;  del.icio.us-style tags and the bookmarks that are marked in a
;;  given bookmark-list state.
;;
;;  And do not forget that all uses of Icicles search also let you do
;;  search-and-replace on the fly.  This applies to `grep' results,
;;  searching marked files in Dired, tags navigation, and Imenu
;;  navigation.  You can at any time replace the current search hit or
;;  just the part of it that matches your current input.
;;
;;(@* "Defining and Saving Sets of Files or Buffers")
;;  ** Defining and Saving Sets of Files or Buffers **
;;
;;  Let's assume that you have one or more sets of files or buffers
;;  that you use frequently.  For each such set of objects, you create
;;  an Emacs option whose value is a list of the file or buffer names
;;  (strings).
;;
;;  Later, you use the option value to refer to those objects by name.
;;  This brings you back to the context of working with just those
;;  particular files or buffers that belong to your project.  You can
;;  search such sets or navigate among their objects.  Icicles has a
;;  number of features that can help with these tasks.
;;
;;  Note: Bookmarks are also persistent references to files and
;;  buffers, and you can use sets of bookmarks similarly.  Bookmarking
;;  is a vanilla Emacs feature.  Being able to manipulate explicit
;;  sets of bookmarks is a `Bookmark+' feature (library
;;  `bookmark+.el').  Bookmarking features are described elsewhere,
;;  but they work in concert with Icicles to offer very good project
;;  support.  See (@> "Icicles Bookmark Enhancements").
;;
;;  Before you can name and save a set of file or buffer names, you
;;  must define its members: pick the file and buffer names that you
;;  want to belong to a given project.  Icicles can help with this.
;;
;;  For buffers, use commands `icicle-add-buffer-config' and
;;  `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to define one or more buffer
;;  configurations.  These are named sets of buffers, sort functions,
;;  and other parameters that control completion of buffer names.
;;  Thereafter, you can use command `icicle-buffer-config' to choose a
;;  configuration to be current.
;;
;;  To define a set of files, you use Icicles completion against file
;;  names.  You can use progressive completion, chip away the
;;  non-elephant, and so on, to get just the file names you want.
;;
;;  For this completion, you can use a command that calls
;;  `read-file-name', and so matches relative file names using the
;;  current `default-directory'.  Or you can use a command that calls
;;  `completing-read', and so matches file names only as ordinary
;;  strings, that is, with no notion that they are file names.  In the
;;  latter case, the file names are often absolute, which means that
;;  you can match not only file names but also directory components.
;;
;;  Examples of the former type are `icicle-find-file' and
;;  `icicle-find-file-read-only' (`C-x C-r' by default).  Examples of
;;  the latter type are `icicle-find-file-absolute',
;;  `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table', `icicle-recent-file', and
;;  `icicle-locate-file'.  Command `icicle-file' (bound to `C-x C-f'
;;  by default) lets you do both, depending on the prefix argument.
;;
;;  You save a set of file and directory names the same way you save
;;  any set of completion candidates.  You can save all of the names
;;  that match your current input.  You can add a set of names or
;;  individual names to a set of names that you have already saved.
;;
;;  In addition, you can save the names of the marked files and
;;  subdirectories in Dired persistently as a project.
;;  
;;  Your project is not only files that are all in the same directory,
;;  of course.  If you use library `Dired+' then you can also save all
;;  of the marked file names in the current directory and in marked
;;  subdirectories, recursively - see (@> "Save Marked Names Here and Below").
;;
;;  Even if you do not use `Dired+' with Icicles you can easily save
;;  file names from multiple directories in the same set.  And you can
;;  include directory names as well, for use later with commands that
;;  operate on directories.
;;
;;  Finally, you can also save file names as Emacs filesets and use
;;  those the same way.  An Icicles cache-file set of saved file names
;;  can include Emacs filesets - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Filesets and Icicles Saved Completion Sets").
;;
;;  See Also:

;;
;;(@* "Retrieving and Reusing a Saved Project")
;;  ** Retrieving and Reusing a Saved Project **
;;
;;  This section could also be called "Using Retrieved Saved Sets".
;;
;;  You retrieve a set of saved file names (a project) the same way
;;  you retrieve any saved set of completion candidates.  That is, you
;;  access the files defined for your project by retrieving their
;;  names during completion, to serve as the current set of completion
;;  candidates.  This odd feature is unique to Icicles.
;;
;;  There's nothing much more to say about this, except that you
;;  should be taking advantage of it now.  Define and save a set of
;;  project files (or buffers), and later use just those files,
;;  staying within the bounds of your project for your navigation,
;;  search, compilation, etc. needs.  Even if the files you use in a
;;  given project are scattered all over your file system, Icicles
;;  lets you access them together as a named unit.  For more
;;  information, see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  If you use library `bookmark+.el' then you can open a project that
;;  is defined by a set of bookmarks, by doing one of the following:
;;
;;  * Using a project-specific bookmark file.
;;
;;  * Using a bookmark-list bookmark (it records a `*Bookmark List*'
;;    buffer state, including which bookmarks are marked or omitted).
;;
;;  You can also open Dired for a project or for a list of file names
;;  saved non-persistently as completion candidates - only those files
;;  are listed in the Dired buffer.
;;  See (@> "Icicles Dired Enhancements").
;;
;;  You can also run `grep' on a saved list of file names using `M-s
;;  M-s g' ( command `icicle-grep-saved-file-candidates').  If you use
;;  library `dired+.el', then you can also `grep' the files in a
;;  project or saved list of file names by opening it in Dired and
;;  then using `M-g' (`diredp-do-grep').
;;
;;  Finally, note that among the sets of completion candidates that
;;  you can save are Icicles search hits.  That's right.  Icicles
;;  search lets you search multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks, and
;;  you can save selected search hits or all matching hits for later
;;  use.  When you save search hits, Icicles records the buffer or
;;  file names and the hit locations within those buffers or files.
;;  When you retrieve such a saved set to access its hits, Icicles
;;  automatically takes you to the proper files.
;;
;;  A related feature is being able to filter tags definitions and
;;  then save the filtered hit list.  This works the same way, and it
;;  gives you the equivalent of per-project tags files: A saved hit
;;  list acts just like a custom tags file when you reuse it.  And
;;  unlike some of your project files, a tags file does not change
;;  often, so saved hit sets stay accurate longer.
;;
;;(@* "Semantics? Roll Your Own?")
;;  ** Semantics? Roll Your Own? **
;;
;;  I no longer develop software.  I just putz around with Emacs Lisp
;;  for my own enjoyment, entertainment, and enlightenment.  So I do
;;  not use things like ECB (Emacs Code Browser) or Semantic
;;  (Bovinator).  I do not use any IDE that has knowledge of a
;;  particular programming language.  The Icicles commands I've
;;  written therefore use little or no semantic or language
;;  information; they rely upon syntax for the most part, and they are
;;  essentially language-agnostic (i.e. ignorant).
;;
;;  But you are a different story.  If you use, say, Semantic, you
;;  could write a little Emacs-Lisp code to take advantage of Icicles
;;  in combination with Semantic's parser information.  With complete
;;  ignorance of Semantic, I dare say it would not be hard.  If you
;;  can get an alist of completion candidates for something from
;;  Semantic in some context, then you can exploit all of the Icicles
;;  features: apropos completion, progressive completion,
;;  multi-commands, Icicles search, and so on.  Likewise for any other
;;  IDE that plays well with Emacs and for any other programming
;;  language support.  Think about it.  Others would appreciate your
;;  contribution.
;;
;;  Icicles provides lots of features for Emacs-Lisp programmers.  The
;;  end-user commands I've written using some of those features are
;;  really just a demonstration of what you can do.  Try rolling your
;;  own Icicles commands.  See Also: (@> "Note to Programmers").
 
;;(@* "Using Complex Completion Candidates")
;;
;;  Using Complex Completion Candidates
;;  -----------------------------------
;;
;;  This section could also be called "Applying a Function
;;  Interactively" or "Mapping over Sets".  It is about applying a
;;  function to members of a set of completion candidates that you
;;  select interactively.  The candidates can represent arbitrarily
;;  complex data, and the function is applied to the associated data
;;  as well, not just to the displayed (string) candidate that names
;;  the data.
;;
;;  You already know that you can manipulate sets of candidates - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;  The elements of those sets are strings; you choose
;;  candidate names.  Sometimes, however, you need to choose among
;;  named items that are themselves complex, containing more
;;  information than just the name.  That is the idea behind
;;  multi-command `icicle-apply', which this section introduces.
;;
;;  You (or a command that you use) can obtain the information
;;  associated with a name after you choose the name.  This is what
;;  happens, for instance, when you use `find-file'; the command looks
;;  up the file associated with the file name you choose.  Icicles
;;  multi-commands such as `icicle-file' perform this lookup both when
;;  you act on a candidate during completion (e.g. `C-RET') and when
;;  you make a final candidate selection (`RET') - see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").
;;
;;  Names and their associated information can be available in Emacs
;;  Lisp in the form of an association list (alist), that is, a list
;;  whose items are conses (cons cells).  An alist is often used to
;;  represent a function that maps one set of things to another.  The
;;  conses in the alist represent the tuples (typically pairs) of
;;  related items.  The car of each cons is called its "key"; the cdr
;;  is called its "value".  Different alists have different kinds of
;;  keys and values.  Typical key types include symbols and strings;
;;  typical value types include symbols, strings, numbers, and lists.
;;  There are quite a few standard Emacs-Lisp variables whose value is
;;  an alist.  Most are internal variables, but some are user options.
;;  See the Emacs-Lisp manual for more about alists.
;;
;;  The completion mechanism of Emacs function `completing-read' can
;;  take an alist as input: the keys are the completion-candidate
;;  strings that you choose from.  For Emacs completion, however, the
;;  value (cdr) of each alist key/value entry is completely ignored.
;;  Icicles uses `completing-read', and it works the same way.  If a
;;  command needs to access the value associated with a key
;;  (candidate), then it must somehow do so independently of
;;  completion.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-search' offers an example of this.  The completion
;;  alist contains key/value pairs whose car (key) is a search-hit
;;  string that matches your search string and whose cdr (value) is
;;  the buffer position for the hit.  When you use completion with
;;  this command, you work only with the keys, but `icicle-search'
;;  also keeps track of the corresponding buffer positions for you.
;;  The logic for doing this is coded into the definition of
;;  `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  It is common to want to do something interesting interactively
;;  with the values also, not just the keys, of a completion alist.
;;  Why lose the important value information when you choose a key?
;;  And instead of requiring the logic of each command to deal with
;;  this need individually, why not provide a general mechanism for
;;  accessing this information - both by program and interactively?
;;  This is what command `icicle-apply' is for.
;;
;;  To make use of completion alist values, you need to access the cdr
;;  of a key/value cons (pair).  Different alists are structured
;;  differently: the cdr can itself be complex (structured - a cons).
;;  In general, you want to access not just the cdr (value) but the
;;  key as well, the key/value pair as a whole, to do what you want
;;  with it - that is, to apply some function to it.
;;
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers sometimes map functions over lists to
;;  obtain a different list.  For example, mapping the function `1+'
;;  over the list (3 1 4 1 5 9) gives the list (4 2 5 2 6 10).  Or if
;;  interested only in the side effects, they apply a function
;;  iteratively over a list without bothering to accumulate the
;;  results as a new list.  The command `icicle-apply' is inspired by
;;  these common practices of mapping and iterating over a list, but
;;  it applies only to alists.  And it lets you choose interactively
;;  which alist elements to act on, instead of always acting on all
;;  elements.
;;
;;  `icicle-apply' lets you apply a function of your choice to any
;;  number of key/value entries in an alist.  As user of the command,
;;  you choose the entries to act on.  The alist is used for
;;  completion; you choose among the keys.  The function is applied to
;;  the corresponding key/value pairs, however, not to the keys alone.
;;
;;  For example, given the alist `auto-mode-alist' and the function
;;  `cdr', you can choose to apply `cdr' to selected alist entries.
;;  This acts as a simple lookup function, because `cdr' just returns
;;  the value associated with a chosen key.  If you choose, for
;;  example, the candidate (key) "\.el\'", then the (value) result is
;;  the symbol `emacs-lisp-mode'.  In this case, the chosen key/value
;;  pair is ("\\.el\\'" . emacs-lisp-mode).  (A literal backslash must
;;  be doubled in an Emacs-Lisp string.)
;;
;;  Function `cdr' returns the value, which is `emacs-lisp-mode' here.
;;  If instead of `cdr' you use the function (lambda (x)
;;  (describe-function (cdr x))), then the result of choosing
;;  candidate "\.el\'" is to display the help for function
;;  `emacs-lisp-mode'.  This function first uses `cdr' to obtain the
;;  value (the mode) and then applies `describe-function' to that
;;  value.
;;
;;  A typical use of `icicle-apply' is to define your own
;;  multi-command that you or someone else can use to act on objects
;;  selected by name.  The definition of command `icicle-goto-marker'
;;  provides an example.  It uses an alist whose elements are pairs
;;  composed of a text line (the key) and the marker (the value) in
;;  that line.  It applies a function that moves to the marker.
;;
;;  If called interactively (as opposed to being used to define
;;  another command), `icicle-apply' lets you use completion to choose
;;  not only the objects to act on but also the function to apply to
;;  them and the alist to choose them from.  See the doc string of
;;  `icicle-apply' for more information.
;;
;;  Note that you can type in a lambda expression when prompted for
;;  the function.  You can use any function, provided it targets a
;;  key/value pair (a cons).  This is why you could not simply use
;;  `describe-function' itself as the function to apply in the example
;;  above: `describe-function' expects a symbol argument, not a cons.
;;
;;  So what is `icicle-apply' really for?  Anything you want.  You can
;;  use it to simply browse an alist or to perform actions on complex
;;  things.  The idea is to let you take advantage of Icicles features
;;  to interactively filter and manipulate a set of completion keys,
;;  and then apply any function you like to them - not just to the
;;  keys, but to the keys or their values, or both.
;;
;;  You can use apropos (regexp) matching or prefix matching to filter
;;  the alist, as always, during completion.  You can use `C-RET' and
;;  so on to act on (that is, apply the function to) selected
;;  key/value pairs that match your current input.
;;
;;  You can also act on *all* such pairs, by using `C-!' or `M-!'.
;;  `C-!' corresponds to iterating over the items in a list, applying
;;  a function to each.  `M-!' applies a function not to each chosen
;;  pair, but to the *list* of all chosen pairs.  By default, the
;;  completion candidates are not sorted, but you can of course sort
;;  them in various ways, either interactively or by program.
;;
;;  As an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you can use function `icicle-apply'
;;  programmatically to let users look things up in alists that you
;;  construct or to act on selected alist entries in complex ways.
;;  Icicles just provides the interactive completion features.
;;
;;  The real value of `icicle-apply' comes from what you do with it.
;;  Use it with a database of geographical coordinates to look up
;;  location names provided by users and draw corresponding vicinity
;;  maps.  Use it with a list of hardware configurations to let users
;;  perform diagnostic or maintenance operations on selected
;;  equipment.  You get the idea - use your imagination.
;;
;;  Note: Although completion alists normally require string-valued
;;  keys, `icicle-apply' is designed to work with any alist.
 
;;(@* "Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction")
;;
;;  Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Here's another crazy Icicles feature: Instead of choosing a
;;  function (e.g. command) and then the object to apply it to, choose
;;  the object first and then the function.
;;
;;  The first thing to say about this feature is that Emacs is not
;;  really designed for this, so it's not feasible to do this in a
;;  entirely satisfactory way.  In particular, there is no practical
;;  way, given an object, to find all of the functions that apply to
;;  it, in order to allow all of those functions, and only those
;;  functions, as completion candidates.
;;
;;  The second thing to say is that there are several ways that
;;  Icicles helps you operate on an object that you have already
;;  chosen:
;;
;;  * apropos completion - (1) choose an object type by name, (2)
;;    choose a function, (3) choose the target object
;;
;;  * alternative action by type, during completion - (1) choose a
;;    target object, (2) choose a function appropriate for the
;;    object's type.
;;
;;  * `M-RET' during completion - (1) choose a target object, (2)
;;    choose any function
;;
;;  * `icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything' - (1) choose an
;;    object type by name, (2) choose the target object, (3) choose a
;;    function
;;
;;  As a special case, if you use library Anything (`anything.el'),
;;  then `icicle-object-action' lets you apply one or more Anything
;;  actions defined for the object.  See (@> "Icicles with Anything")
;;  for more information.
;;
;;(@* "Apropos Completion as OO")
;;  ** Apropos Completion as OO **
;;
;;  You can use apropos completion with `M-x' to narrow the set of
;;  possible commands to those that have a given object type in their
;;  name.  You choose the command before the individual object, but
;;  you at least choose the object type first (which narrows the set
;;  of possible objects).
;;
;;  If you use Icicles, you already use apropos completion this way,
;;  but you might not have thought about it in these terms.  If you
;;  want to invoke some command on a buffer, you might start by typing
;;  `M-x buffer S-TAB' or `M-x buff S-TAB'.  This is simple, but it
;;  really does get you most of the way toward object-action
;;  interaction.  And you can of course then use progressive
;;  completion (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to filter the matching commands for
;;  additional object-type names; for example `S-SPC window' keeps
;;  only those commands whose names contain both `buffer' and
;;  `window'.
;;
;;  Of course, this approach requires the command name to actually
;;  advertise truthfully the object types that it operates on.  There
;;  are false positives and true negatives, but Emacs is generally
;;  quite helpful in this respect.
;;
;;(@* "Alternative Action as OO")
;;  ** Alternative Action as OO **
;;
;;  As explained in
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Alternative Actions"),
;;  many Icicles commands, as their alternative action
;;  (e.g. `C-S-RET'), prompt you to choose an action to be applied to
;;  the current completion candidate.  The actions you can choose are
;;  all appropriate functions for the current type of object
;;  (candidate).  If you use library Anything (see below), then any
;;  actions defined for the current type by Anything are included.
;;
;;  See Also:
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Alternative Actions").
;;
;;(@* "M-RET")
;;  ** M-RET **
;;
;;  `M-RET' (`M-return'), `icicle-candidate-read-fn-invoke', during
;;  completion provides a typeless object-action interaction, which is
;;  always available.  (You can also use `ESC RET' or `ESC C-m'.)
;;
;;  This is similar to the action choice provided for some commands by
;;  `C-S-RET', except that there is no notion of the current object
;;  type - you can choose from among all Emacs-Lisp functions.
;;
;;  Whenever you cycle through completion candidates, `M-RET' enters a
;;  recursive edit that prompts you for a function to apply to the
;;  current candidate.  `M-mouse-2' does the same thing.  For example,
;;  if the current candidate is a buffer named `foo.el', then `M-RET'
;;  prompts you for a function to apply to it.  (Actually, the
;;  function is applied to the candidate, which is the buffer name in
;;  this case, but many functions accept an object name in place of
;;  the object.)
;;
;;  The function you enter can be anything, including a lambda
;;  expression that accepts an argument of the appropriate type.  The
;;  function is read with (lax) completion.  It is up to you to choose
;;  a function that is appropriate for the current object type.
;;
;;  If you use a prefix argument (`C-u M-RET' or `C-u M-mouse-2'),
;;  then the result of the function application is pretty-printed.
;;  Otherwise, the function is called for effect only.
;;
;;(@* "`icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything'")
;;  ** `icicle-object-action' and `icicle-anything' **
;;
;;  Another way that Icicles helps with object-action interaction is
;;  provided by command `icicle-object-action'.  This reads an
;;  object-type name ("what"), with completion; then it reads an
;;  object of that type ("which"), with completion; then it reads a
;;  function (name or lambda expression) to apply to the object
;;  ("how"), with (lax) completion.  Again, use a prefix argument if
;;  you want to pretty-print the result.
;;
;;  `what-which-how' is an alias for command `icicle-object-action'.
;;  It is easy to remember, taking its name from the successive input
;;  prompts: "What?" - a file.  "Which?" - icicles.el.  "How?" open.
;;  Another alias for the same command is `a', because it acts on a
;;  file, a buffer, a symbol, a process, and so on.  The first thing
;;  it does is prompt you for the type of object, so you do `M-x a RET
;;  buffer', `M-x a RET symbol', and so on.
;;
;;  The aliases `what-which-how' and `a' are just convenience
;;  commands.  They are defined only if user option
;;  `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' is non-`nil'.  Two related
;;  commands are also defined only if this option is non-`nil':
;;
;;  * `file'   - same as `a RET file'
;;  * `buffer' - same as `a RET buffer'
;;
;;  For example: `M-x file RET'.  You are prompted for a file to act
;;  on, and then for the action to use.
;;
;;  Note: If you use AUCTeX, then be aware of an AUCTeX bug that
;;  causes problems if `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' is
;;  non-`nil'.  Here is the bug description, filed 2007/10/05 by Bjorn
;;  Haagensen:
;;  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-auctex/2007-10/msg00006.html.
;;  The problem is that AUCTeX mistakenly invokes the Icicles `file'
;;  command, in an inappropriate context.  AUCTeX does not define any
;;  function `file' when it is loaded, but it invokes one, if defined.
;;  This appears to be a name-capture problem.  Since there is no
;;  `file' function defined when Icicles is loaded, Icicles defines
;;  its command.  AUCTeX developers will no doubt fix this bug.  Until
;;  then, AUCTeX users can avoid the bug by setting
;;  `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' to `nil'.
;;
;;  The "type" of an object is one of these:
;;
;;  a. A type defining an entry in user option
;;     `icicle-predicate-types-alist'.  These are type predicates,
;;     such as `bufferp', `keywordp', or `atom'.
;;
;;  b. The `type' of an Anything source, or its `name' if it has no
;;     `type'.  This is available only if you use library
;;     `anything.el'.
;;
;;  c. A type defining an entry in user option
;;     `icicle-type-actions-alist'.
;;
;;  Icicles completion is available for each prompt: the type, the
;;  object, and the action to apply to the object.  Types defined by
;;  Anything are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.  In the case of an Anything type, you
;;  can use multi-command features to act on multiple objects in
;;  multiple ways, all within a single `a' invocation.  See
;;  (@> "Icicles with Anything") for more information about using
;;  Anything types.
;;
;;  The objects of types (b) and (c) are easily named, and their names
;;  serve as the completion candidates when you choose them.  So, for
;;  instance, if you choose type `buffer', then you can act on a
;;  buffer by choosing its name.
;;
;;  The objects of predicate type (type a, above) are not necessarily
;;  named.  The completion candidates for these objects are symbols
;;  whose values are the objects that are acted upon. The object-type
;;  names used for these candidates are really Emacs-Lisp type
;;  predicate names, which all end in `p', except for `atom'.
;;
;;  So, for instance, if you choose type `bufferp', then you can
;;  choose a symbol whose value is a buffer, in order to act on that
;;  buffer.  A buffer is of course always named, but an object of type
;;  `stringp' is not.  The value of `emacs-version' is one such string
;;  that you can act on.
;;
;;  Be aware that the action function you choose must accommodate the
;;  object you choose as its only argument.  Also, completion of the
;;  function candidate itself is lax, so you can enter a lambda
;;  expression as the action.
;;
;;  Objects that are naturally associated with names are treated
;;  differently, depending on the type.  Besides Anything types, the
;;  following object types are used for named objects: `buffer',
;;  `command', `face', `frame', `function', `option', `process',
;;  `symbol', `variable', `window'.  For all of these except `window',
;;  the name of the object is used.  For `window', the candidate
;;  objects are the names of the buffers that are currently shown in a
;;  window (on any frame).
;;
;;  You'll note that some types are treated both ways, 1) using named
;;  objects and 2) using symbols whose values are objects.  An example
;;  is `frame' and `framep': the completion candidates (objects) for
;;  type `frame' are frame names; the candidates for type `framep' are
;;  symbols whose values are frames.

;;
;;  Icicles with Anything
;;  ---------------------
;;
;;  Library Anything (`anything.el') lets you define object types and
;;  associate actions with them.  It provides command `anything',
;;  which you can use to apply an action to an object, choosing the
;;  object first by name.  All objects (of all types) that have a name
;;  that matches your input are candidates.  You can use command
;;  `anything' while in Icicle mode; it has the same behavior with
;;  Icicles as without it.
;;
;;  Icicles also integrates some Anything features within its own
;;  completion environment, so that you can use Icicles features such
;;  as progressive completion at the same time.  In particular, you
;;  can act on multiple Anything objects in the same command
;;  invocation, and you can act on them using multiple Anything
;;  actions.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-anything' (alias `any') is just command
;;  `icicle-object-action' (alias `a') restricted to Anything types -
;;  see (@> "Icicles OO: Object-Action Interaction").  It is more
;;  convenient than `a' if you know that you want to use an Anything
;;  type, because the set of type candidates to choose from is more
;;  limited.
;;
;;  When you act on an object of an Anything type, you are not
;;  prompted for the action ("how").  The default Anything action is
;;  applied, or you can choose a different Anything action.
;;
;;  Command `any' (or command `a' when applied to an Anything type) is
;;  a multi-command (see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands")):
;;
;;  * `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', and so on perform the default Anything
;;    action on each chosen object.
;;
;;  * `C-S-RET', `C-S-mouse-2', and so on, prompt you, for each chosen
;;    object, to choose one or more Anything actions (with
;;    completion).
;;
;;  You can thus act on any number of Anything objects in any number
;;  of Anything ways, all in the same `any' command invocation.  And
;;  you can of course use Icicles completion and cycling to choose.
;;  User option `icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag' determines
;;  whether Anything function `anything-transform-candidates' is
;;  applied to displayed Anything candidates in Icicles.
;;
;;  Here's an example of using command `any'.  Let's assume that you
;;  have an `action' entry such as this in `anything-type-attributes'
;;  for the Anything type `command':
;;
;;  (action ("Call interactively"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (call-interactively (intern command-name))))
;;          ("Describe command"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (describe-function (intern command-name))))
;;          ("Add command to kill ring" . kill-new)
;;          ("Go to command's definition"
;;           . (lambda (command-name)
;;               (find-function (intern command-name)))))
;;
;;  This defines four actions for objects of type `command', the
;;  default action being the first listed ("Call interactively").
;;
;;  You enter command `any', choose the Anything type `command', and
;;  then choose the command `icicle-face-list' to act on:
;;
;;    M-x any RET
;;    What (type): command RET
;;    Which (command): icicle-face-list RET
;;
;;  This invokes command `icicle-face-list', because the default
;;  Anything action for an object of type `command' is to call it.
;;
;;  If you use `C-RET' instead of `RET' when choosing command
;;  `icicle-face-list', then you remain within the `any' invocation,
;;  and you can do something with another command after
;;  `icicle-face-list'.  If you use `C-S-RET' when choosing a command,
;;  then you are prompted for the action to invoke for that command:
;;
;;    Which (command): icicle-face-list C-S-RET
;;    How (action): Go to command's definition RET
;;
;;  If you choose the Anything action "Go to command's definition",
;;  then, well, that's what happens: here, you go to the definition of
;;  `icicle-face-list'.  Again, you could use `C-RET' instead of
;;  `RET', to perform this action on the command and then choose and
;;  apply (via `RET' or `C-RET') another action to the same command.
;;
;;  After you've stopped (via `RET' or `C-g') acting on command
;;  `icicle-face-list', you can clear the minibuffer (using `M-k') and
;;  type another command to act on, and so on.  Or, you can stop (via
;;  `RET' or `C-g') and end the invocation of command `any'.
;;
;;  At each prompt, you can use (apropos or prefix) completion or
;;  cycling to pick a candidate.  So, for instance, using completion,
;;  you could simply do this to choose `command', `icicle-face-list',
;;  and "Go to command definition":
;;
;;    M-x any RET c RET face-l S-TAB C-S-RET g TAB RET
;;
;;  Icicles enhances Anything by providing multi-command features, as
;;  well as by providing all of the other standard Icicles features:
;;  apropos and prefix completion, cycling, progressive completion,
;;  help on individual candidates, and so on.  On the other hand,
;;  Anything by itself provides some features that Icicles does not
;;  exploit.  The aim of command `any' is to give you the basic
;;  Anything features in an Icicles completion context.
;;
;;  A significant behavior difference between Anything (that is,
;;  command `anything') and Icicles command `any' is that with
;;  `anything' only the object name is used for filtering, whereas
;;  with Icicles command `any' you first narrow down the potential
;;  candidates by type, before the object name is matched (against
;;  objects of only that type).
;;
;;  That is, with Anything, your input pattern is matched against
;;  every possible object of every possible type.  You then choose
;;  among the matches.  If you want, after that wide-net matching you
;;  can cycle among only the matches of a given type (e.g. file), but
;;  matching against all other types has already taken place.
;;
;;  This behavior of starting with typeless matching can be convenient
;;  sometimes (you need not specify the object type), but it can also
;;  be inconvenient (and unnecessarily slow) to match objects of types
;;  totally unrelated to what you're after.  In such cases, it can
;;  require either a long input pattern or cycling among more
;;  candidates, to disambiguate among the hits.
;;
;;  With Icicles command `any', you have the inconvenience of needing
;;  to specify first the type of object you want, but this has the
;;  advantage of eliminating searching among irrelevant types.
;;  Finally, remember that you can use both `anything' and `any' -
;;  choose whichever is most convenient for the current task.

;;
;;  Completion Methods and Styles
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  Icicles provides different methods to complete your minibuffer
;;  input, dividing these between keys `TAB' and `S-TAB' (these are
;;  the keys by default, but you can use any keys).  Icicles calls the
;;  methods provided by `TAB' "prefix" completion methods, and it
;;  calls the methods provided by `S-TAB' "apropos" completion
;;  methods.
;;
;;(@* "Some Icicles Commands Hard-Code Completion Methods")
;;  ** "Some Icicles Commands Hard-Code Completion Methods" **
;;
;;  Some Icicles commands that allow for multi-completion input,
;;  ignore your current choices of `TAB' and `S-TAB' completion
;;  method.
;;
;;  In particular, this is the case for commands `icicle-file' and
;;  `icicle-buffer' and similar.  Such commands have their own way of
;;  matching the multi-completion parts.
;;
;;  If you want to use alternative completion methods for completion
;;  of file and buffer names then use a different command.  In that

;;
;;(@* "Vanilla Emacs Styles and Option `completion-styles'")
;;  ** Vanilla Emacs Styles and Option `completion-styles' **
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 23, Emacs provides "completion styles", which,
;;  like Icicles completion methods, are different ways to complete
;;  your minibuffer input.  The available styles are defined by
;;  non-option variable `completion-styles-alist'.  They include
;;  `basic', which was the original vanilla completion behavior;
;;  `partial-completion'; `initials'; and (for Emacs 24 and later)
;;  `substring'.  They also include `emacs21' and `emacs22', for the
;;  vanilla completion behavior from those Emacs releases.  See the
;;  Emacs doc for an explanation of completion styles.
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs there is only one set of completion styles that
;;  is ever in effect, defined by option `completion-styles'.  It is a
;;  list of different ways to match your input.  Each style in the
;;  list is tried, in turn, until one of them successfully completes
;;  your input.
;;
;;  All completion candidates you see come from the same style.  You
;;  have no control over which style will actually be used for any
;;  given input, other than ordering the list ahead of time.  And you
;;  have no way of knowing which style was actually used to produce a
;;  given set of candidates.  The relation between your input pattern
;;  and the matches is thus sometimes not so clear.  There is no way
;;  to know, for example, that initial matching failed and partial
;;  matching succeeded.
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs the styles of `completion-styles' can only be
;;  used together - all or none; they are never alternatives that you
;;  can choose at runtime.
;;
;;  Icicles completion methods are instead alternatives - only one is
;;  used at a time to complete your input, and you can switch from one
;;  method to another easily.  For prefix completion (`TAB') you
;;  switch methods using `C-('.  For apropos completion you switch
;;  using `M-('.
;;
;;(@* "Prefix Completion Method `vanilla'")
;;  ** Prefix Completion Method `vanilla' **
;;
;;  When you choose Icicles prefix completion method `vanilla' you get
;;  essentially the behavior of vanilla Emacs completion, that is,
;;  completion according to a list of styles, which are tried one
;;  after the other.
;;
;;  But rather than limiting you to a single styles list (option
;;  `completion-styles'), you can choose anytime from any of several
;;  lists that you define using option `icicle-completion-style-sets'.
;;  Command `icicle-choose-completion-style-set' does this - it sets
;;  the current style set and the value of option `completion-styles'
;;  to whichever set you choose (using completion).  With a prefix
;;  argument, it also saves the new value of `completion-styles' for
;;  future Emacs sessions.
;;
;;  And just as it is quick and easy to flip, during completion, from
;;  one Icicles completion method to another (using `C-(' or `M-('),
;;  so it is with the completion style sets of method `vanilla'.  For
;;  the duration of the current command, you can change to the next
;;  style set using `C-M-(' (command
;;  `icicle-next-completion-style-set').
;;
;;  Among other things, this means that you can try completing using
;;  one style set and, if that does not succeed, switch to another.

;;
;;  Note too this difference between the use of `vanilla' completion

;;(@* "Icicles Completion Methods")
;;  ** Icicles Completion Methods **
;;
;;  The completion methods available for cycling via `C-(' or `M-('
;;  are defined by options `icicle-TAB-completion-methods' and
;;  `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist', respectively.  The first
;;  method in each list is the default (initial) method.
;;
;;  By default, the prefix completion methods (`TAB') include
;;  `vanilla' (see (@> "Prefix Completion Method `vanilla'")), `basic'
;;  (which is the same as vanilla completion style `basic'), and the
;;  following methods, which provide different kinds of what might be
;;  called "fuzzy" matching:
;;
;;  * `fuzzy' - This method uses a fairly sophisticated matching
;;    algorithm that seems to account for various typing mistakes.
;;    This algorithm is provided by library `fuzzy-match.el', so I
;;    call its use in Icicles `fuzzy' completion.  You must have
;;    library `fuzzy-match.el' to use this.
;;
;;  * `swank' - This method completes (only) symbols, using the
;;    algorithm of `el-swank-fuzzy.el' - see that library for details.
;;
;;  By default, the apropos completion methods (`S-TAB') include
;;  `apropos' (regexp matching) and the following methods, which also
;;  provide different kinds of what might be called "fuzzy" matching.
;;  See (@> "Fuzzy Completion") for further descriptions of each.
;;
;;  * `scatter' - This is a simple, poor man's fuzzy matching method
;;    that I call "scatter matching".  Ido calls it "flex" matching.
;;    The TextMate editor has the same thing for file-name matching
;;    (only), without naming it.  It matches the your input
;;    characters, in order, against completion candidates, but
;;    possibly with intervening (non-newline) characters.  It amounts
;;    to matching input `abc' as if it were the regexp `a.*b.*c'.
;;
;;  * `SPC scatter' - This is another poor man's fuzzy method, which
;;    is used by some Emacs packages such as Ivy.  It matches the
;;    parts of your input that are separated by `SPC' characters,
;;    matching arbitrary text at the separations between those parts.
;;
;;  * `Levenshtein' - This method checks whether two strings differ by
;;    at most a given number of character operations, the so-called
;;    "Levenshtein distance".  You must have library `levenshtein.el'
;;    to use this.
;;
;;  * `Levenshtein strict' - Like `Levenshtein', but instead of
;;    checking whether a given string is within a given distance of a
;;    substring of the other, it checks whether it is within a given
;;    distance of the other.  Library `levenshtein.el' is required.
;;
;;  * `Jaro-Winkler' - This method gives matching weight to having
;;    both (a) more characters that match in the right positions
;;    (Jaro) and (b) a longer exact prefix within the first four
;;    characters (Winkler).  Library `fuzzy.el', which is part of
;;    package `auto-complete', is required.
;;
;;  If you have your own method of matching then you can use that too,
;;  by adding it to option `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' for
;;  use by `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  My own opinion about the relative usefulness of the various
;;  completion methods, in order from the most useful: `apropos',
;;  `basic', `vanilla', `scatter', `SPC scatter', `fuzzy',
;;  `Levenshtein', `Jaro-Winkler', and `swank'.  YMMV.
;;
;;  Besides all of these completion methods, remember that you can get
;;  ordinary substring matching with `S-TAB' by using `C-`' to turn
;;  off (toggle) escaping of regexp special characters.  With special
;;  characters escaped, `S-TAB' does literal substring completion.
;;  (You can also get substring completion via completion style
;;  `substring'.)
;;
;;(@* "Changing Completion Method")
;;  ** Changing Completion Method **
;;
;;  You can change completion methods easily at any time, by hitting a
;;  key in the minibuffer:
;;
;;  * `C-(' (command `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') to cycle
;;    among `TAB' completion methods: `vanilla', `basic', `fuzzy', and
;;    `swank' (`vanilla' only for Emacs 23 and later; `fuzzy' only if
;;    you have library `fuzzy-match.el'; `swank' only if you have
;;    library `el-swank-fuzzy.el').
;;
;;  * `M-(' (command `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method') to cycle
;;    `S-TAB' completion methods: `apropos', `scatter', `SPC scatter',
;;    `Levenshtein', `Levenshtein strict', and `Jaro-Winkler' (only if
;;    you have library `fuzzy.el', which is part of package
;;    `auto-complete').
;;
;;  Repeating `C-(' and `TAB' or `M-(' and `S-TAB' on the fly for the
;;  same input can be a good way to learn the differences between the
;;  various completion methods.
;;
;;  If you provide a prefix argument to `C-(' or `M-(', then the newly
;;  chosen method is used only for the current command.  More
;;  precisely, the previously active method is restored as soon as you
;;  return to the top level.
;;
;;  Note this difference when cycling completion style sets using
;;  `C-M-(': the effect is only for the current command.  For method
;;  cycling you need to use a prefix argument to affect only the
;;  current command.  With no prefix argument, `C-(' and `M-(' affect
;;  both the current command and subsequent behavior.
;;
;;(@* "Command-Specific Completion Methods")
;;  ** Command-Specific Completion Methods **
;;
;;  Sometimes you might want to make a different set of completion
;;  methods available during input.  You can use options
;;  `icicle-TAB-completion-methods-per-command' and
;;  `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-per-command' to do this.  These
;;  define the methods to be made available during specific commands
;;  that read input with completion.  That is, they give you
;;  command-specific control over `C-(' and `M-('.
;;
;;  The per-command control is provided by advising (`defadvice') the
;;  particular commands.  You can also do this interactively, using
;;  commands `icicle-set-TAB-methods-for-command' and
;;  `icicle-set-S-TAB-methods-for-command'.  Invoking one of these
;;  with a negative prefix argument removes the advice, restoring the
;;  default choice of methods for the target command.
;;
;;  For example, the following interaction sets the available `TAB'
;;  methods for command `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' to fuzzy and
;;  basic:
;;
;;    M-x icicle-set-TAB-methods-for-command RET
;;    Command: icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG RET
;;    TAB methods: fuzzy RET
;;    TAB methods: basic RET
;;    TAB methods: RET
;;
;;  Fuzzy will be the default method for this command, since it is
;;  first.
;;      
;;  And the following interaction removes the special treatment for
;;  `C-(' during `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG', restoring the default
;;  `TAB' methods that are defined by option
;;  `icicle-TAB-completion-methods':
;;
;;    C-- M-x icicle-set-TAB-methods-for-command RET
;;    Command: icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG RET
;;
;;(@* "Fuzzy Completion")
;;  ** Fuzzy Completion **
;;
;;  This section presents details about the Icicles completion methods
;;  that might be called "fuzzy".
;;
;;  "Fuzzy" is itself a fuzzy term.  The effect of `apropos' (regexp)
;;  matching or matching using completion style `partial-completion'
;;  can sometimes be thought of as fuzzy.  In fact, the same could be
;;  said of any matching that ignores some of your input.  For
;;  example, `partial-completion' can be similar to `scatter'
;;  completion, but it requires you to explicitly mark where to skip
;;  ahead (using `*', ` ' (space), or `-').
;;
;;(@* "Scatter-Match (Flex) Completion")
;;  *** Scatter-Match (Flex) Completion ***
;;
;;  What Icicles calls "scatter-match" completion (`S-TAB' completion
;;  method `scatter') is sometimes "flex" completion (for Ido, for
;;  example) called.
;;
;;  The idea is very simple: input characters are matched in order
;;  against completion candidates, but possibly with intervening
;;  (non-newline) characters.  That is, your input scatter-matches a
;;  completion candidate if each character is also in the candidate,
;;  and the character order is respected.
;;
;;  What this really amounts to is matching input `abc' as if it were
;;  the regexp `a.*b.*c'.  That's all.
;;
;;  You can use Icicles scatter matching in place of apropos (regexp)
;;  matching.  Unlike the cases of swank and fuzzy-match completion
;;  (see below), you can use it to complete file names also.
;;
;;(@* "`SPC' Scatter-Match Completion")
;;  ** `SPC' Scatter-Match Completion **
;;
;;  This is the method that library Ivy uses for its "fuzzy" matching.
;;
;;  This is like method `scatter', except that instead of matching
;;  each input character, allowing matching of arbitrary (non-newline)
;;  text between them, it matches each sequence of non-`SPC'
;;  characters, allowing matching of arbitrary (non-newline) text
;;  between them.
;;
;;  More precisely, this acts as if a single `SPC' character of a
;;  sequence of `SPC' characters in your input were `.*', leaving the
;;  other `SPC' characters in that sequence to be matched literally.
;;  It amounts to matching input `abc    def  gh i' as if it were the
;;  regexp (four `SPC' characters between `abc' and `def', two between
;;  `def' and `gh', one between `gh' and `i') as the regexp
;;  `abc   .*def .*gh.*i' (three `SPC' characters between `abc' and
;;  `def', and two between `def' and `gh').
;;
;;(@* "Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion")
;;  *** Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion ***
;;
;;  Library `el-swank-fuzzy.el' is required for Icicles to use
;;  fuzzy-symbol completion.
;;
;;  If you choose `swank' `TAB' completion, what you get in Icicles is
;;  fuzzy completion, but only for symbols.  Symbols are completed
;;  using the algorithm of `el-swank-fuzzy.el'.  See that library for
;;  details.
;;
;;  Icicles options `icicle-swank-timeout' and
;;  `icicle-swank-prefix-length' give you some control over the
;;  behavior.  When the `TAB' completion method is `swank', you can
;;  use `C-x 1' (`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-timeout+') and `C-x 2'
;;  (`icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+') in the minibuffer
;;  to increment these options on the fly using the arrow keys `up'
;;  and `down'.
;;
;;  Swank symbol completion uses heuristics that relate to supposedly
;;  typical patterns found in symbol names.  It also uses a timeout
;;  that can limit the number of matches.  It is generally quite a bit
;;  slower than fuzzy completion, and it sometimes does not provide
;;  all candidates that you might think should match, even when all of
;;  your input is a prefix (or even when it is already complete!).
;;
;;  If swank completion produces no match when you think it should,
;;  remember that you can use `C-(' on the fly to change the
;;  completion method.
;;
;;  I do not necessarily recommend swank symbol completion, but it is
;;  available for those who appreciate it.
;;
;;  Like fuzzy-match completion (see next), swank completion always
;;  sorts candidate symbols according to its own scoring, putting what
;;  it thinks are the best matches first.  This means that using `C-,'
;;  in the minibuffer to sort candidates differently has no effect.
;;
;;(@* "Fuzzy-Match Completion")
;;  *** Fuzzy-Match Completion ***
;;
;;  Library `fuzzy-match.el' is required for Icicles to use
;;  fuzzy-match completion.
;;
;;  Fuzzy-match completion (`S-TAB' completion method `fuzzy') takes
;;  more explaining.  It is described in detail in the commentary of
;;  library `fuzzy-match.el'.  Here are some things to keep in mind
;;  when you use Icicles fuzzy-match completion, which goes by the
;;  name `fuzzy':
;;
;;  * It reverts to basic prefix completion for file names.  That is,
;;    file-name completion is never fuzzy.
;;  * It is always case-sensitive.  This means that `C-A' in the
;;    minibuffer (to toggle case sensitivity) has no effect on `fuzzy'
;;    completion.
;;  * It always takes a space prefix in your input into account.  This
;;    means that `M-_' in the minibuffer has no effect on `fuzzy'
;;    completion.
;;  * Completion candidates are always sorted by decreasing match
;;    strength.  This means that using `C-,' in the minibuffer to sort
;;    candidates differently has no effect.
;;
;;  Fuzzy-match completion is a form of prefix completion in which
;;  some input characters might not be present in a matched candidate.
;;  Matching finds the candidates that have the most characters in
;;  common with your input, in the same order and with a minimum of
;;  non-matching characters.  It can skip over non-matching
;;  characters, as long as the number of characters skipped in the
;;  candidate is less that those following them that match.  After the
;;  matching candidates are found, they are sorted by skip length and
;;  then candidate length.
;;
;;  Here are some examples:
;;
;;  Input         Completion Domain  Matches (Candidates)
;;  -----         -----------------  --------------------
;;
;;  abc           {xxabcxx, xabcxxx,
;;                          xabx}    {xabcxxx, xxabcxx}
;;
;;  point-mx      Emacs variables    {point-max, point-max-marker}
;;
;;  begining-of-l Emacs commands     {beginning-of-line,
;;                                    beginning-of-line-text,
;;                                    move-beginning-of-line,
;;                                    widget-beginning-of-line}
;;
;;  The last example shows that although `fuzzy' completion is a kind
;;  of prefix completion, your input is not necessarily a prefix of
;;  each matching candidate.  It tries to match your input starting at
;;  its beginning.  This input prefix is matched against candidate
;;  substrings, not necessarily candidate prefixes, but the
;;  non-matching part (if any) preceding the matched substring must
;;  not be longer than the matching part.  That is, non-matching
;;  substrings can be skipped over, but they must be no longer than
;;  the matching substrings that follow them.  If an input prefix does
;;  not match under these conditions, it is skipped over.
;;
;;  After matching an input prefix this way, the same process is
;;  repeated, recursively, for input text following that prefix and
;;  for match positions following the matches found.  That is, after
;;  each such prefix match, the process starts again where it left off
;;  in both the input and the candidates.  The resulting matches
;;  contain one or more substrings of your input that are each at
;;  least as long as the non-matching parts that immediately precede
;;  them.  Only matches with the highest number of matching characters
;;  are retained.  They are sorted by two criteria: (1) nearness of
;;  matches to the start of the candidate and (2) candidate length.
;;
;;  The fuzzy-match algorithm is detailed in library `fuzzy-match.el'.
;;  However, it is easier to get a feel for what it does by trying it
;;  than by reading any description.  Just give it a try.  Do not
;;  expect it to rival apropos completion in power or expressivity,
;;  however.  Instead, think of it as prefix completion for lazy or
;;  inaccurate typists!  If that sounds like you, then you might find
;;  it useful.
;;
;;  As an example, here are some command-name candidates for the input
;;  `fo' (there are lots more):
;;
;;  fortune          forms-mode       focus-frame
;;  follow-mode      forward-sexp     forward-list
;;  forward-word     forward-line     forward-page
;;  ...
;;  ifconfig         info             Info-up
;;  ...
;;  Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node    Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node
;;
;;  And here are all the command-name candidates for the input `fol':
;;
;;  follow-mode            follow-delete-other-windows-and-split
;;  Info-last              info-lookup-file       info-lookup-reset
;;  Info-last-preorder     info-lookup-symbol     Info-last-menu-item
;;  nnfolder-generate-active-file     mh-folder-mode
;;
;;  The first thing to notice is the distribution of candidates for
;;  input `fo'.  Candidates are in decreasing order of match fit:
;;
;;  * The nearer the match to the start of the candidate, the better
;;    the fit.
;;
;;  * The greater the ratio of matched text to unmatched text, the
;;    better the fit.
;;
;;  Note too the candidate `ifconfig'.  First, note that it has no
;;  strict match for substring `fo'.  Its match is in fact in two
;;  parts: `f', then `o'.  Second, note that it is considered a better
;;  fuzzy match than the candidate `info'.  This is because its match
;;  (`f') is nearer to the start of the candidate (second character,
;;  versus third).
;;
;;  The second thing to notice is that when you type the third input
;;  character, `l', the candidates are not a subset of the original
;;  set that matches `fo'.  The candidates in the second screenshot
;;  all match `fol' in a fuzzy way, even though one of them,
;;  `mh-folder-mode', does not match `fo' sufficiently well to be
;;  included as a candidate.  Why?  Because in the `fo' case, the
;;  match is only two characters long and it starts after three
;;  non-matching characters.
;;
;;  For both inputs: If all input prefixes are fair game for matching,
;;  why doesn't `*Completions*' also include other command names that
;;  match only the prefix `f' and nothing else?  Because there is at
;;  least one match that matches more than that - only the best
;;  matches are retained.  In this case, the best matches for input
;;  `fo' match both the `f' and the `o', and the best matches for
;;  input `fol' match all three of those characters.
;;
;;  Refer to `fuzzy-match.el' for a precise description of fuzzy
;;  matching.  It refers to "matchiness" for how many characters match
;;  and "closeness" for the ratio of number of characters matched to
;;  candidate length.
;;
;;  Note: It is not practical to try to highlight the exact candidate
;;  portions that match different parts of your input.  Because
;;  fuzzy-match input does not function as a literal string for
;;  matching purposes, it is more akin to substring matching than to
;;  basic prefix matching.  For this reason, regexp-match highlighting
;;  is used for fuzzy matching.  That is why you see the input `fo'
;;  highlighted in `*Completions*' candidates in other than just the
;;  prefix position.  It is also why the matching `f' and `o' in
;;  candidate `ifconfig' are not highlighted: for highlighting
;;  purposes, your input is treated as a regexp.
;;
;;  One takeaway here is that fuzzy-match completion is complicated.
;;  Rather than try to understand how it works and think ahead in
;;  those terms, you just need to get a feel for it - learn by doing.
;;  Have fun!
;;
;;(@* "Levenshtein Completion")
;;  *** Levenshtein Completion ***
;;
;;  Library `levenshtein.el' is required for Icicles to use
;;  Levenshtein completion.
;;
;;  The "Levenshtein distance" is the maximum number of character
;;  insertions, deletions, or replacements that are needed to
;;  transform one string to another.  The more similar two strings
;;  are, the smaller their Levenshtein distance.
;;
;;  When this kind of `S-TAB' completion is used, Icicles considers
;;  your input to match a completion candidate if their Levenshtein
;;  distance is no greater than the value of option
;;  `icicle-levenshtein-distance'.  The default value of the option is
;;  1, meaning that the difference is at most one character operation.
;;
;;  Using a strict definition of the distance, this also requires the
;;  length of your input to be within the Levenshtein distance of the
;;  length of a completion candidate, for it to match.  That is quite
;;  restrictive.
;;
;;  It is more flexible to consider your input to match a candidate if
;;  it is within `icicle-levenshtein-distance' of some *substring* of
;;  the candidate.  Because candidate substrings are tested, the
;;  length of your input need not be nearly the same as the candidate
;;  length.
;;
;;  When you cycle among `S-TAB' completion methods using `M-(', there
;;  are thus two choices for Levenshtein completion: `Levenshtein' and
;;  `Levenshtein strict'.  The former is generally more useful.
;;
;;  The larger the value of `icicle-levenshtein-distance', the slower
;;  Levenshtein completion becomes, since it must test more
;;  possibilities.  Also, when the value is 1 (except for `Levenshtein
;;  strict'), Icicles uses a fast, special-case algorithm, and it
;;  highlights the matching parts of candidates in buffer
;;  `*Completions*'.  1 is the most useful value.
;;
;;  If the value is other than 1 (or if it is 1 with `Levenshtein
;;  strict'), then you must also use library `levenshtein.el', and
;;  Levenshtein completion can be quite slow.  In that case, you will
;;  no doubt want to turn off incremental completion (`C-#').
;;
;;(@* "Jaro-Winkler Completion")
;;  ***  Jaro-Winkler Completion ***
;;
;;  Library `fuzzy.el', from package `auto-complete', is required for
;;  Icicles to use Jaro-Winkler completion.
;;
;;  The Jaro-Winkler `S-TAB' completion method was originally
;;  developed for comparing names for the U.S. census.  It tends to
;;  take into account some typical spelling mistakes, and it is best
;;  suited for use with short candidates.
;;
;;  When checking whether two strings match, higher matching weight
;;  results when there are more characters in each string that are
;;  also present in the other, and in approximately the same
;;  positions.
;;
;;  Looking only at those characters that nearly match in this sense
;;  (same character in about the same position), the more exact
;;  matches there are (same character in exactly the same position),
;;  the higher the matching weight.  That is, weight is reduced for
;;  characters that nearly match but are not quite in the right
;;  position.
;;
;;  So far, this describes Jaro matching.  The Jaro matching weight is
;;  the average of three values; (a) the ratio of the first string's
;;  near matches to its length, the same for the second string, and
;;  (c) the ratio of exact matches to total matches (near and exact).
;;
;;  The Winkler part of the method comes from giving additional weight
;;  for prefixes that match exactly.  The longer the exact prefix
;;  match (up to 4 characters) the greater the weight.
;;
;;  Unlike the other matching methods, for Jaro-Winkler to complete
;;  your input it must have the same number of characters as the
;;  candidate to be matched, plus or minus two (actually
;;  `fuzzy-accept-length-difference').  In particular, this means that
;;  you cannot hit `S-TAB' with an empty minibuffer to see all of the
;;  candidates.

;;
;;  Completion in Other Buffers
;;  ---------------------------
;;
;;  In addition to input completion, you can use Icicles to complete
;;  words and symbols in other buffers, besides the minibuffer.
;;  Icicles enhances this completion in these ways:
;;
;;  1. Lisp symbol completion via `M-TAB' (`lisp-complete-symbol').
;;     (This is also `ESC-TAB' and `C-M-i'.)
;;
;;  2. Word completion using the dynamic abbreviation of standard
;;     Emacs library `dabbrev.el', via `C-M-/'.
;;
;;  3. Word completion using the `dynamic-completion-mode' of standard
;;     Emacs library `completion.el', via `C-RET' or `M-RET'.
;;
;;  4. Word completion using the words and phrases in a thesaurus, via
;;     `C-c /' (requires library `synonyms.el').
;;
;;  5. Mailing-information completion for BBDB (Insidious Big Brother
;;     Database).
;;
;;  6. `TAB' completion of the following in Shell mode and ESS modes
;;     (and other, similar interpreters):
;;
;;     * Commands
;;     * Previous inputs - commands plus their arguments
;;     * File names
;;     * Environment variables
;;
;;  Whenever multiple completion candidates are available, you can use
;;  Icicles completion, with all of its features: cycling of
;;  candidates (`TAB', `down', or `next'), apropos (regexp) completion
;;  (`S-TAB'), progressive completion (`S-SPC'), help on individual
;;  candidates (`C-M-RET'), and so on.
;;
;;(@* "Dynamic Completion Using `dabbrev.el'")
;;  ** Dynamic Completion Using `dabbrev.el' **
;;
;;  Library `dabbrev.el' lets you type a few characters in a buffer
;;  and then prefix-complete them (in the same buffer) to a full word
;;  or symbol name.  The completion candidates come from words or
;;  symbol names in buffers that you are editing.  Emacs calls this
;;  functionality "dynamic abbreviation", though "dynamic completion"
;;  would be a better term for it (words are completed dynamically,
;;  not abbreviated).
;;
;;  Library `dabbrev.el' provides two ways to dynamically complete
;;  text:
;;
;;  a. `M-/' (command `dabbrev-expand') completes to a candidate word.
;;     Repeating it replaces the completion with a different one -
;;     that is, it cycles candidates in the text buffer (not in the
;;     minibuffer).
;;
;;  b. `C-M-/' (command `dabbrev-completion') completes to the common
;;     prefix of all matching completion candidates.  Repeating it
;;     displays buffer `*Completions*' for you to choose a candidate.
;;     However, in this case, there is no way to cycle among the
;;     candidates.
;;
;;  If there are many candidate completions then cycling among them
;;  with `M-/' can be tedious.  You can use `C-M-/' to complete to a
;;  common prefix, thus narrowing the set of candidates, but then you
;;  lose the ability to cycle among them.
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' contains an entry
;;  for `dabbrev-completion' then Icicles remaps keys normally bound
;;  to command `dabbrev-completion' to command
;;  `icicle-dabbrev-completion', which uses Icicles completion
;;  whenever there are multiple completion candidates.  You can then
;;  use any Icicles features, such as apropos completion and candidate
;;  cycling.  In addition, you can complete an empty prefix, starting
;;  from scratch with apropos completion.
;;
;;(@* "Dynamic Completion Using `completion.el'")
;;  ** Dynamic Completion Using `completion.el' **
;;
;;  Standard Emacs library `completion.el' is quite old and little
;;  known nowadays.  It is nevertheless very useful.  In a way, it is
;;  like `dabbrev.el' on steroids.  It is pretty smart, proposing
;;  first the completions that you have used most recently.  You can
;;  use it anywhere, to complete all kinds of buffer text.
;;
;;  The command for completing the text before point is `complete' (an
;;  unfortunately general name, as is the name of the library), which
;;  is bound globally to `C-RET' and `M-RET' when you are in
;;  `dynamic-completion-mode'.
;;
;;  Command `complete' can act similar to the `dabbrev' commands, in
;;  which case it is said to be using method `cdabbrev' (but this name
;;  is not defined in any way programmatically; it is referred to
;;  informally).
;;
;;  But the `dabbrev'-like behavior of `complete' is only a fallback,
;;  when its normal completion method comes up empty-handed.  The
;;  normal method matches what you type against a persistent personal
;;  "database" of completions, which is constructed and updated
;;  automatically as you type.  (It is saved only on demand or when
;;  you exit Emacs.)
;;
;;  To make good use of this library, you really should read the
;;  complete Commentary in the `completion.el' source code (keeping in
;;  mind that in a few places it is not up to date).  But the doc
;;  string of command `icicle-complete' (which is the version of
;;  `complete' used in Icicle mode) is a good place to start.
;;
;;  To make this kind of completion available, you must turn on
;;  `dynamic-completion-mode'.
;;
;;  Here is the beginning of the `completion.el' Commentary:
;;
;;    This watches all the words that you type and remembers them.
;;    When typing a new word, pressing "complete" (meta-return)
;;    "completes" the word by inserting the most recently used word
;;    that begins with the same characters.  If you press meta-return
;;    repeatedly, it cycles through all the words it knows about.
;;
;;    If you like the completion then just continue typing, it is as
;;    if you entered the text by hand.  If you want the inserted extra
;;    characters to go away, type control-w or delete.  More options
;;    are described below.
;;
;;    The guesses are made in the order of the most recently "used".
;;    Typing in a word and then typing a separator character (such as
;;    a space) "uses" the word.  So does moving a cursor over the
;;    word.  If no words are found, it uses an extended version of the
;;    `dabbrev'-style completion.
;;
;;    You automatically save the completions you use to a file between
;;    sessions.
;;
;;    Completion enables programmers to enter longer, more descriptive
;;    variable names while typing fewer keystrokes than they normally
;;    would.
;;
;;  Just as for the `dabbrev' commands, Icicles enhances this
;;  completion by letting you use Icicles minibuffer completion when
;;  there are multiple candidates.  This happens only if one of these
;;  is true:
;;
;;  * The number of candidates is greater than the value of option
;;    `icicle-cmpl-max-candidates-to-cycle'.
;;
;;  * There are at least two candidates and you explicitly request
;;    Icicles completion by using two or more plain prefix arguments
;;    (`C-u C-u').
;;
;;  What about that fallback completion method, `cdabbrev'?  Vanilla
;;  `complete' uses it only if no matching completions are found in
;;  the database.  (It is generally slower than database lookup.)
;;
;;  Icicles lets you choose whether to match only database completions
;;  or also terms found in your current Emacs windows (`cdabbrev'), by
;;  customizing option `icicle-cmpl-include-cdabbrev-flag'.
;;
;;  If the option value is non-`nil' then whenever Icicles completion
;;  is used the candidates include the completions found dynamically
;;  by searching your current windows.  If it is `nil' then only
;;  database completions are candidates.  The dynamically found
;;  candidates are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate', so you can easily distinguish them.
;;
;;(@* "Thesaurus Lookup and Completion")
;;  ** Thesaurus Lookup and Completion **
;;
;;  Library `synonyms.el' provides various features for defining a
;;  thesaurus and looking up words and phrases in it.  Icicles
;;  provides a multi-command version (alias `icicle-synonyms') of the
;;  command `synonyms', which shows all of the synonyms that match a
;;  regular expression (e.g. a word or phrase) and lets you navigate
;;  among hyperlinked thesaurus entries.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' completes a word in a
;;  text buffer to any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  With the
;;  default value of option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings', this is
;;  bound to `C-c /' in Icicle mode.
;;
;;  Tip: You can use `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' to quickly
;;  check the spelling of a word.  If it is correctly spelled, then it
;;  appears as a complete completion (is highlighted as such in the
;;  minibuffer).
;;
;;  Another Icicles (multi-)command that uses the thesaurus is
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'.  It lets you use Icicles
;;  completion, cycling, and so on to insert thesaurus words and
;;  phrases in any buffer.  It does not complete the word at point.
;;  Within a single call to it, insert any number of thesaurus
;;  entries, in succession.  If you wanted to, you could write an
;;  entire book using a single call to
;;  `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!
;;
;;  All of these Icicles commands require that you load library
;;  `synonyms.el'.
;;
;;(@* "BBDB Completion")
;;  ** BBDB Completion **
;;
;;  Library `bbdb.el' is a rolodex-like database program for GNU
;;  Emacs.  You can obtain a recent version, such as 3.1, from one of
;;  these locations:
;;
;;  * https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bbdb/
;;  * http://melpa.milkbox.net/
;;
;;  If user option `icicle-functions-to-redefine' contains an entry
;;  for `bbdb-complete-mail' (for BBDB version 3.0.2 or 3.1) or
;;  `bbdb-complete-name' (for BBDB version 2.35), then Icicles
;;  redefines that command so that it uses Icicles completion when
;;  there are multiple completions.  You can use any Icicles features,
;;  such as apropos completion and candidate cycling.  For this
;;  feature to take effect, you must load BBDB before you load
;;  Icicles.  By default, option `icicle-functions-to-redefine'
;;  includes an entry for `bbdb-complete-mail' (not for
;;  `bbdb-complete-name').
;;
;;  (If you have BBDB version 3.0.2 instead of version 3.1, then
;;  uncomment the version of `icicle-bbdb-complete-mail' in
;;  `icicles-cmd1.el' that supports BBDB version 3.0.2.)
;;
;;(@* "Completion in Comint Modes")
;;  ** Completion in Comint Modes **
;;
;;  `TAB' in a shell or similar buffer provides Icicles completion for
;;  command names, file names, and environment variables that are
;;  known to the shell (or other interpreter).
;;
;;  You can also complete input using your previous inputs as the set
;;  of candidates.  Just type something at the prompt, hit `C-c `',
;;  and pick one or more previous inputs to execute again (this uses
;;  `icicle-search', so it is a multi-command).  You need not
;;  re-execute the exact same shell command; you can edit your
;;  previous input before hitting `RET' to enter the command.
;;
;;  These features are available for Comint mode and several modes
;;  that inherit from it, including Shell mode, Shell Script (SH)
;;  mode, various ESS modes (Emacs Speaks Statistics), Inferior
;;  Emacs-Lisp mode (IELM), Grand Unified Debugger (GUD) mode, Tcl
;;  mode, Rlogin mode, and NS Lookup mode.

;;
;;(@* "Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode")
;;  ** Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode **
;;
;;  Icicles works especially well with Delete Selection mode, which I
;;  use and recommend.  (Likewise, for PC selection mode, which uses
;;  Delete Selection mode.)  In Delete Selection mode, whenever the
;;  region (selection) is active (highlighted), you can simply type to
;;  replace text in the region, or hit `DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d'
;;  (Delete) to delete the region.
;;
;;  However, library `delsel.el', which provides Delete Selection
;;  mode, binds keys in minibuffer maps that are also bound by
;;  Icicles.  For this reason, if you use both Icicles and Delete
;;  Selection mode, you must turn on Icicle mode after you turn on
;;  Delete Selection mode.  If you forget to do this, you will notice
;;  that `C-g' does not abort minibuffer input.  The remedy is simply
;;  to turn Icicle mode off, then on again.
;;
;;(@* "Icicles User Options and Faces")
;;  ** Icicles User Options and Faces **
;;
;;  There are many user options (user variables) and several faces
;;  that Icicles defines, and you can also use various standard user
;;  options, including Icomplete options, that control various aspects
;;  of completion.
;;
;;  One thing that can be important to understand is that if you
;;  customize an option, and if the default value of that option
;;  changes later in a more recent Icicles version, then your
;;  customization will preclude your taking advantage of any new
;;  features represented by that default option value.
;;
;;  This is important particularly for complex options such as
;;  `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  Taking that option as an
;;  example, if Icicles later adds more commands with default key
;;  bindings then you will not see those bindings if you have a
;;  customized value of `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  There is
;;  nothing wrong with that; I just want you to be aware of it.
;;
;;  In general, it can be a good idea to look at the latest change-log
;;  entry for `icicles-opt.el' in `icicles-chg.el', to see what
;;  changes have been made.  If you then want to take advantage of
;;  some change, you can use `M-x customize-option' and visually
;;  compare your customized value with the new default value in
;;  `icicles-opt.el', then edit your customized value as you like.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-mode-hook' is a normal hook containing
;;    functions that are run after entering and exiting Icicle mode.
;;    This is `nil', by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook' is a list of
;;    functions to be run at the end of minibuffer setup for Icicle
;;    mode.  This is `nil', by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-update-input-hook' is a list of functions to
;;    be run when minibuffer input is updated (typing or deleting).
;;    This is `nil', by default.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-no-match-hook' is a list of functions to be
;;    run during completion (`TAB' or `S-TAB') when there are no
;;    completion candidates that match the current input.  This is
;;    `nil', by default.
;;
;;  * Case sensitivity: The following standard user options control
;;    whether completion distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase
;;    letters:
;;
;;    * `completion-ignore-case'
;;    * `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' (Emacs 22 and later)
;;    * `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case' (Emacs 23 and later)
;;
;;    In addition, you can toggle case-sensitivity at any time using
;;    `C-A' (that is, `C-S-a') in the minibuffer.  This toggles
;;    `case-fold-search' and `completion-ignore-case'.  With a prefix
;;    argument, it also toggles
;;    `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' and
;;    `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case'.
;;
;;    More precisely, it toggles the default value of
;;    `case-fold-search', and then it sets the other variables to the
;;    value of `case-fold-search'.  Because the default value of
;;    `case-fold-search' is changed, all buffers are affected.  Note
;;    that because some Icicles commands bind one or more of these
;;    variables, toggling case-sensitivity during command execution
;;    will not necessarily toggle their global values.
;;
;;    You can tell whether completion is currently case-sensitive by
;;    looking at the Icicle minor-mode lighter in the mode line, if
;;    `icicle-highlight-lighter-flag' is non-`nil'.  If
;;    case-sensitive, then the lighter text (with or without the
;;    multi-command suffix `+' and the multi-completion suffix `||')
;;    is `Icy'; if not, it is `ICY'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-region-background',
;;    `icicle-point-position-in-candidate',
;;    `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate', and
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' are all used to define
;;    the region (the selected text) when cycling completion
;;    candidates.  They are described below individually.  The region
;;    is active when cycling, so you can easily delete it or replace
;;    it.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-point-position-in-candidate' defines the
;;    minibuffer cursor position (point) while cycling candidate
;;    completions.  By default, the cursor is placed at the end of the
;;    root being completed.  You can instead place it at the root
;;    beginning or at the beginning or end of the complete minibuffer
;;    input.  For file-name input, the beginning of minibuffer input
;;    starts after the directory name (which is inserted
;;    automatically).
;;
;;  * Similarly, user option `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate'
;;    defines the position of the mark; by default, it is at the end
;;    of the input.  Together, these two options control the size and
;;    placement of the region in a flexible way.  You can make the
;;    region include all of the input, only the root, from beginning
;;    to root, or from root to end.  You can put the cursor at either
;;    end of the region.  You can get rid of the region altogether, by
;;    making point and mark coincide (at any of the possible
;;    positions).
;;
;;  * Because the region background color is often quite different
;;    from the frame background color (in order to have it stand out),
;;    it can be a bit hard to read the completion candidates when the
;;    region is highlighted in the minibuffer during input cycling.
;;    If user option `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is
;;    non-`nil', however, then the region background is changed in the
;;    active minibuffer to a color that differs only slightly from the
;;    frame background, making it easier to read the completion
;;    candidates.  The actual background color used is the value of
;;    `icicle-region-background', which you can customize.  (If you
;;    make this color the same as the frame background, then the
;;    region background is, in effect, invisible.)
;;
;;  * The default value of `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is
;;    determined by the current value of `delete-selection-mode', that
;;    is, whether or not Delete Selection mode is enabled, when
;;    Icicles is loaded.  For this reason, if you use Delete Selection
;;    mode and you want the region background to change in the
;;    minibuffer, you should either turn on Delete Selection mode
;;    before loading `icicles.el' or explicitly customize
;;    `icicle-change-region-background-flag' to non-`nil'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-default-value' controls the treatment of a
;;    default value for minibuffer input.  When the value is non-`nil'
;;    and non-t, and the INITIAL-INPUT argument of minibuffer-reading
;;    functions is `nil' or "", the DEFAULT-VALUE argument can be
;;    inserted into the minibuffer as the initial input.
;;
;;    For `completing-read' and `read-file-name', if the option value
;;    is `t' then the default value is normally added to the prompt as
;;    a hint.  However, for `read-file-name', if option
;;    `insert-default-directory' is non-`nil', then to avoid
;;    duplication:
;;
;;    * If the default value is the same as the value of
;;      `default-directory' then it is not added to the prompt.
;;
;;    * If the default value is added to the prompt then it is first
;;      made relative to `default-directory'.
;;
;;    Adding the default value to the prompt corresponds to the more
;;    or less conventional behavior of vanilla Emacs.  But vanilla
;;    Emacs does not do this systematically for `completing-read' (or
;;    for any of the input-reading functions).  Instead, it hard-codes
;;    default values into prompts in the commands that call these
;;    functions.
;;
;;    By design, Icicles commands never add the default value to the
;;    prompt themselves.  This includes Icicles versions of standard
;;    commands that might do so.  Icicles instead tries to give users
;;    the choice, using option `icicle-default-value'.
;;
;;    Functions `completing-read', `read-file-name', and `read-string'
;;    are the only input-reading functions for which Icicles adds the
;;    default value to the prompt (for option value `t').  Other such
;;    functions, such as `read-from-minibuffer', treat empty input
;;    (just `RET') specially - see their doc for details.
;;
;;    Inserting the default value in the minibuffer as the initial
;;    input has the advantage of not requiring you to use `M-n' to
;;    retrieve it.  It has the disadvantage of making you use `M-k'
;;    (or do something else) to get rid of the default value in the
;;    minibuffer if you do not want to use or edit it.
;; 
;;    If you often want to use or edit the default value, then set
;;    `icicle-default-value' to non-`nil' and non-`t'.  If you rarely
;;    do so, then set it to `nil` or `t'.
;;
;;    A non-`nil', non-`t' value of `icicle-default-value' controls
;;    also whether or not the initial value is preselected, and where
;;    to leave the cursor: at the beginning or end of the value.
;;    Preselecting the value can be useful in Delete Selection mode or
;;    PC Selection mode, because it makes it easy to replace that
;;    value by typing characters, or delete it by hitting `DEL'
;;    (Backspace) or `C-d' (Delete).  However, all of the initial
;;    input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL', which is
;;    inconvenient if you want to edit it only slightly.
;;
;;  * If you use `t' as the value of `icicle-default-value' then you
;;    can use option `icicle-default-in-prompt-format-function' to
;;    format the text that shows the (first) default value in the
;;    prompt.  The option value is a function that accepts the
;;    default value (a string) and returns a string that is prepended
;;    to the first occurrence of ": " in the prompt.  This option has
;;    no effect unless `icicle-default-value' is `t'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' and
;;    `icicle-default-thing-insertion' control the behavior of `M-.'
;;    in the minibuffer, which grabs text from the current buffer and
;;    yanks it into the minibuffer.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor")
;;    and the doc string (`C-h v') of
;;    `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' for more information.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements'
;;    specifies a list of function replacements for
;;    `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete' to replace the functions in
;;    `comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.  You can use this to
;;    provide Icicles completion for various modes that inherit from
;;    Comint mode.  By default, it treats Comint mode and Shell mode.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-input-string' is a regexp string that is
;;    inserted in the minibuffer when you use `C-='.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting a Regexp from a Variable or Register").
;;
;;  * In buffer `*Completions*', face `icicle-historical-candidate' is
;;    used to highlight completion candidates that you have used
;;    (entered with `RET') previously.  This highlighting is
;;    controlled by user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.  You can toggle
;;    this option from the minibuffer at any time using `C-pause'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  * In buffer `*Completions*' during completion for multi-command
;;    `icicle-Info-index' (`i' in Info), face
;;    `icicle-historical-candidate-other' can be used to highlight
;;    index topics that refer to Info nodes that you have already
;;    visited.  This highlighting is controlled by options
;;    `icicle-Info-highlight-visited-nodes' and
;;    `icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.
;;    See (@> "Highlighting Index Topics for Visited Info Nodes").
;;
;;  * In buffer `*Completions*', face `icicle-saved-candidate' is used
;;    to highlight completion candidates that you have saved (e.g.,
;;    using `C-M->').  This highlighting is controlled by user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-saved-candidates-flag'.  You can toggle this
;;    option from the minibuffer at any time using `S-pause'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Saving and Retrieving Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  * In buffer `*Completions*', face
;;    `icicle-current-candidate-highlight' highlights the current
;;    completion candidate, face
;;    `icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions' highlights the
;;    expanded common match among all completions, and face
;;    `icicle-annotation' is used for candidate annotations.  Faces
;;    `icicle-match-highlight-Completions' and
;;    `icicle-match-highlight-minibuffer' highlight whatever your
;;    input matches, in buffer `*Completions*' and in the minibuffer,
;;    respectively.  In the minibuffer, face `icicle-complete-input'
;;    highlights your input when it is complete.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag' means
;;    that Icicles will not add menu items to menu-bar menus, except
;;    for the `Icicles' and `Minibuf' menus.  Default value `nil'
;;    means that whenever a relevant menu already exists, Icicles
;;    items are added to it (when in Icicle mode).  Put differently,
;;    non-`nil' means consolidate all Icicles menu items in a single
;;    `Icicles' menu.
;;
;;    For example, if `nil' then item `Delete File' is added to the
;;    `File' menu; otherwise it is added to the `Icicles' menu.
;;
;;    The value of this option is used only when Icicle mode is
;;    initially established, so changing it has no effect after
;;    Icicles has been loaded.  However, you can change it and save
;;    the new value, so it will be used next time.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-functions-to-redefine' controls whether
;;    Icicles redefines some standard functions, enhancing them to use
;;    Icicles completion.  You can specify which functions to
;;    redefine.  The original function definitions are restored when
;;    you exit Icicle mode.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-inhibit-advice-functions' is a list of functions
;;    that Icicles redefines, and for which Icicle mode deactivates
;;    the advice.  The advice for each is reactivated when you leave
;;    Icicle mode.  Generally, it is a bad idea to use advice with
;;    functions that Icicles redefines, in particular minibuffer
;;    functions.  If you want to allow some such advice or prohibit
;;    advice for additional functions, then customize this list.
;;
;;    Note: If you or a library you load advises one of these
;;    functions while you are in Icicle mode, then toggle Icicle mode
;;    twice, so that this option can have the proper effect.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-widgets-to-redefine' is a list of widgets that
;;    Icicles redefines for Icicle mode.  Widgets are Emacs objects
;;    used, in particular, by Customize.  The default value is `(color
;;    file)', meaning that the `color' and `file' widgets are
;;    redefined.  They are redefined to allow Icicles completion on
;;    color and file-name fields.
;;
;;    With these redefinitions, when you edit a color or file-name
;;    field in Customize (in Icicle mode) `M-TAB' performs Icicles
;;    completion.  Initially, prefix completion is used, but you can
;;    then use apropos completion, progressive completion, and so on.
;;
;;    For file-name completion, the portion of the name before point
;;    in the editing field is completed.  By default, the rest of the
;;    field content, past point, is not deleted.  If you use a prefix
;;    argument (i.e., `C-u M-TAB') then the rest of the line is
;;    deleted.
;;
;;    For color completion, a prefix argument means to use the RGB
;;    value of the color, not its name, as the option value.
;;
;;    For color completion, if `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' is
;;    non-`nil' then completion is WYSIWYG.  You can complete against
;;    the color name or its RGB value, or you can enter an RGB value
;;    with no name without completing.  See function
;;    `icicle-widget-color-complete' for more information.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag' means that whenever
;;    there is only one completion candidate that matches your input,
;;    that candidate is used immediately, without requiring you to hit
;;    `RET' or `S-RET'.
;;
;;  * When `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag' is non-`nil',
;;    option `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-delay' is the
;;    number of seconds Icicles waits, before returning to top level
;;    with the sole completion.  (It has no effect if the flag is
;;    `nil'.)  The delay gives you a chance to forestall acceptance of
;;    the sole completion: editing the completion (typing or deleting
;;    a character) before the delay expires prevents its automatic
;;    acceptance.  The default value is 0 seconds (no delay).
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' specifies top-level
;;    commands and their bindings for Icicle mode.  By default, this
;;    rebinds several standard Emacs keys (in Icicle mode only).  For
;;    example, it substitutes `icicle-kill-buffer' for `kill-buffer'
;;    (binding it to whatever `kill-buffer' is bound to globally).
;;    Top-level commands are commands that are not used only in the
;;    minibuffer.  To change these bindings, customize
;;    `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  If you do that, then you must
;;    exit and re-enter Icicle mode to ensure that the change takes
;;    effect.  This is really necessary only if your changes would
;;    undefine a key.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-minibuffer-key-bindings' specifies bindings
;;    for keys available during minibuffer input in Icicle mode.
;;    These bindings are in effect whether or not completion is
;;    available.  This does not include keys concerned with
;;    completion, cycling, and help, which are covered by other user
;;    options.  The value has the same form as for option
;;    `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completion-key-bindings' specifies bindings
;;    for keys available during minibuffer input with completion.
;;    These are generally not commands that complete your minibuffer
;;    input, but commands that you use to edit that input or act on it
;;    in different ways.  The value has the same form as for option
;;    `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings' specifies
;;    bindings for additional keys available during completion of
;;    buffer-name candidates.  The default value of the option
;;    provides keys that filter (narrow) the set of available
;;    candidates.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completion-list-key-bindings' specifies key
;;    bindings for buffer `*Completions*'.  The value has the same
;;    form as for option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-candidate-help-keys' specifies the keys that
;;    display help about the current completion candidate.  The
;;    default values are `C-M-RET' (`C-M-return'), `C-M-help',
;;    `C-M-f1', `C-help', and `C-f1'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-candidate-action-keys' specifies the keys
;;    that act on the current completion candidate.  The default value
;;    is `C-RET' (`C-return').
;;
;;  * The following user options specify the keys to use for
;;    mode-specific completion-candidate cycling.  The default
;;    bindings are in parentheses.
;;
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys'                (`next')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys'            (`prior')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys'                 (`end')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'             (`home')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-action-keys'         (`C-next')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-action-keys'     (`C-prior')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-action-keys'          (`C-end')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-action-keys'      (`C-home')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-alt-action-keys'     (`C-S-next')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-alt-action-keys' (`C-S-prior')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-alt-action-keys'      (`C-S-end')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-alt-action-keys'  (`C-S-home')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-help-keys'           (`C-M-next')
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-help-keys'       (`C-M-prior')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-help-keys'            (`C-M-end')
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-help-keys'        (`C-M-home')
;;
;;  * The following user options specify the keys to use for cycling
;;    candidates according to the current completion mode.  The
;;    default bindings are in parentheses.
;;
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys'                  (`down')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'                    (`up')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys'           (`C-down')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys'             (`C-up')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-alt-action-keys'       (`C-S-down')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys'         (`C-S-up')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-help-keys'             (`C-M-down')
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys'               (`C-M-up')
;;
;;    The completion mode, and hence the behavior of these keys, is
;;    changed only when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' during completion:
;;    the mode is prefix completion after `TAB' and apropos completion
;;    after `S-TAB'.
;;
;;    Note: If your customizations of the modal and non-modal cycling
;;    keys conflict, the non-modal values win.  For example, if you
;;    define both `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys' and
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys' as the list `([up])', then
;;    the `up' key will perform prefix cycling, not modal cycling.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-default-cycling-mode' determines the
;;    completion mode to be used before you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.
;;    This affects only modal cycling - e.g. using keys such as `down'
;;    and `C-down'.  Values:
;;
;;    - `prefix' (default) means cycle prefix completions
;;    - `apropos' means cycle apropos completions
;;    - other non-`nil' value means cycle inputs from input history
;;    - `nil' means do not cycle: you must first hit a completion key
;;
;;    For example, if the value is `apropos' then you can immediately
;;    cycle apropos completions without first hitting `S-TAB'.
;;
;;    Once you have used `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse
;;    the input history is to use `M-p' and `M-n'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-word-completion-keys' is a list of keys to
;;    use for word completion.  By default, the only such key is
;;    `M-SPC'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys' is a list
;;    of keys to bind to `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display'.  By
;;    default, these keys are `C-M-S-tab' and `C-M-S-iso-lefttab',
;;    which together implement `C-M-S-TAB'.  Similarly,
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display'.  By default, the only such
;;    key is `C-M-tab'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete'.  By default, these keys are `tab' and
;;    `C-i', which together implement `TAB'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-apropos-complete-keys' is the list of keys to
;;    bind to `icicle-apropos-complete'.  By default, these keys are
;;    `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', which together implement `S-TAB'.
;;    (In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that
;;    represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in
;;    the default value.)
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-key-complete-keys' is the list of keys to bind to
;;    `icicle-complete-keys'.  By default, this is the singleton list
;;    ([backtab]).  The `backtab' key is the canonical key that
;;    represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab'.  All three of these
;;    keys implement `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer' is the list of
;;    keys that Icicles binds to `icicle-complete-keys' in the
;;    minibuffer keymaps.  By default, this is the list ([M-backtab]
;;    [ESC backtab]), which means `M-S-TAB' and `ESC S-TAB'
;;    (essentially equivalent to `M-S-TAB').  `S-TAB' itself is of
;;    course used (by default) for apropos completion of your
;;    minibuffer input, so it cannot also be used for key completion
;;    in the minibuffer.  If your window manager steals `M-S-TAB' then
;;    try `ESC S-TAB' or customize this option to choose another key.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-complete-keys-ignored-prefix-keys' is a list of
;;    prefix keys to be ignored by `icicle-complete-keys' (`S-TAB').
;;    What this really means is that you can bind
;;    `icicle-complete-keys' to a key sequence that uses one of these
;;    prefix keys, and when you invoke it that way it acts as if
;;    invoked at top level.  Otherwise, it would show you only the
;;    keys bound on that prefix key.  This gives you a way to invoke
;;    top-level key completion from a key sequence that uses a prefix
;;    key.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-isearch-complete-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    `icicle-isearch-complete'.  By default, these keys are `M-TAB',
;;    `ESC TAB', and `C-M-TAB'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-isearch-history-insert-keys' is the list of keys
;;    for `icicle-isearch-history'.  By default, the list contains
;;    only `M-o'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys' is the list of keys
;;    for invoking file-name completion on demand.  By default,
;;    `C-M-S-f' is the only such key.  Option
;;    `icicle-completing-read+insert-keys' is the list of keys for
;;    invoking non file-name completion on demand.  By default,
;;    `C-M-S-c' is the only such key.  See 
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Completion On Demand").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag' `nil' means that keys
;;    such as `C-next', which combine candidate action and cycling,
;;    cycle to the next (or previous) candidate and act on it.
;;    Non-`nil' means they act on the current candidate and then cycle
;;    to the next (or previous) candidate.  When the value is `nil',
;;    you can think of `C-next' as an operation on the next candidate.
;;    When the value is non-`nil', you can think of `C-next' as an
;;    operation on the current candidate, which ends by making the
;;    next candidate current.  Similarly for the other cycling keys
;;    that act, alternative-act, or show help on a candidate.  The
;;    default value is `nil'.  See also option
;;    `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag', which changes the keys affected
;;    by `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag'.
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag' is `nil', then the
;;    keys that cycle candidates are swapped with the keys that both
;;    cycle and act on a candidate.  You can then use `down', `up',
;;    `next', `prior', `end' and `home' to both cycle and act, and
;;    `C-down', `C-up', `C-next', `C-prior', `C-end', and `C-home' to
;;    merely cycle, without acting (e.g. navigating).  The option has
;;    no effect on other keys.  You can toggle this option at any time
;;    using `M-g' (`icicle-toggle-C-for-actions') in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    (The keys mentioned here are the default bindings.  The actual
;;    keys swapped are those defined by these user options:
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys',
;;    `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys',
;;    `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys',
;;    `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys', `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'.)
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-find-file-expand-directory-flag'
;;    prevents the choice of a directory-name candidate using `RET' or
;;    `mouse-2' during file-name completion from opening Dired on the
;;    directory.  Instead, Icicles cycles into the directory,
;;    presenting its contents as the completion candidates.  It thus
;;    makes `RET' behave like `C-M-/'.  The option has no such effect
;;    on multi-command candidate-action keys such as `C-RET' and
;;    `C-mouse-2'.  You can toggle this option using `C-x /'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-TAB/S-TAB-only-completes-flag' inhibits
;;    `TAB' and `S-TAB' (actually the keys that are the values of
;;    options `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' and
;;    `icicle-apropos-complete-keys') from also cycling candidates.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-wrap-around-cycling-flag' means cycling
;;    wraps around to the beginning or end of the current completion
;;    candidates after it reaches the end or the beginning,
;;    respectively.  This is the default behavior; customize the value
;;    to `nil' if you don't want wrap-around.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag' means
;;    that hitting `TAB' for completion immediately shows the
;;    completion candidates in buffer `*Completions*'.  If `nil', then
;;    candidates are shown only after `TAB' is hit a second time,
;;    which is the standard Emacs behavior.  The default value is `t'.
;;    (Actually, the concerned keys are those defined by option
;;    `icicle-prefix-complete-keys', not necessarily `TAB'.)
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-max-candidates' means truncate the list
;;    of completion candidates to at most this many.  If you use
;;    library `doremi.el' then you can use `C-x #' during completion
;;    to increment or decrement the option value using the vertical
;;    arrow keys or the mouse wheel.  A numeric prefix argument for
;;    `C-x #' sets the increment size.  A plain prefix argument
;;    (`C-u') resets `icicle-max-candidates' to `nil', meaning no
;;    truncation.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' controls
;;    whether completion expands your minibuffer input to (typically)
;;    the longest substring common to all completion candidates and
;;    that matches your input pattern.  The option controls whether
;;    and when such expansion takes place.  The possible values are:
;;
;;    0 - Never expand your typed input, except when you use `C-M-TAB'
;;        or `C-M-S-TAB'.
;;
;;    1 - Expand it only when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', that is,
;;        explicit completion, not incremental completion - no
;;        automatic expansion.
;;
;;    2 - Same as 1, but also automatically expand it when it matches
;;        only one completion candidate.
;;
;;    3 - Same as 2, but also automatically expand it during
;;        incremental prefix completion.
;;
;;    4 - Same as 3, but also automatically expand it during
;;        incremental apropos completion.  IOW, always expand it.
;;
;;    As the value increases there are thus more contexts in which
;;    your input can be expanded to the common match.
;;
;;    You can toggle the value of this option at any time using `C-"'
;;    in the minibuffer.  This in fact swaps the values of this option
;;    and option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-alt'.  That is
;;    the only purpose of the latter option: to let you go switch
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' back and forth between two
;;    values.
;;
;;    You can cycle the value of `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'
;;    among all its possible values using `C-M-"' in the minibuffer.
;;    Together with `C-"', this also lets you change the value of
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-alt': Use `C-M-"' to cycle
;;    to the value you want as the alternative, then use `C-"' to
;;    swap.  Then use `C-M-"' to cycle to the value you want for
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'.
;;
;;    Input expansion replaces your input in the minibuffer.  If you
;;    want to edit your original, pre-expansion input, use `C-l'.  If
;;    you are also cycling among candidates then you might need to hit
;;    `C-l' twice.  One reason you might want to set
;;    `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' to a value other than 4 is
;;    if you want to always work with a regexp in the minibuffer when
;;    you use apropos completion.  (With a value of 4 the regexp is
;;    replaced automatically by the match expansion.)

;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option
;;    `icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag' hides, in buffer
;;    `*Completions*', the common match for your current input from
;;    each candidate.  You can toggle this anytime during completion
;;    using `C-x .' (no prefix argument), which is bound to command
;;    `icicle-toggle-hiding-common-match'.  The common match used is
;;    that governed by option `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag' hides, in
;;    buffer `*Completions*', all lines in multi-line candidates that
;;    do not match your current minibuffer input.  In Emacs 22+,
;;    consecutive such lines are elided as `...'.  You can toggle this
;;    option anytime during completion using `C-u C-x .', which is
;;    bound to command `icicle-toggle-hiding-non-matching-lines'.
;;
;;    Hiding non-matching lines can be especially useful when
;;    candidates are large (many lines), such as full function
;;    definitions (e.g., from `icicle-imenu-full').
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag' controls
;;    whether or not buffer `*Completions*' is shown initially,
;;    without your needing to hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to show it.
;;    However, if you type something before
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-delay', then display is
;;    inhibited.  The default value is `nil', meaning that
;;    `*Completions*' is not shown until you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.
;;    More typical than setting this option to non-`nil' globally is
;;    to bind it to non-`nil' in Emacs-Lisp code, to display
;;    `*Completions*' as a menu.  For example, pass a non-`nil'
;;    binding to `icicle-define-command' to create a command that
;;    displays a multiple-choice menu.
;;
;;    For an alternative but similar behavior to using non-`nil' for
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag', you can set option
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion' to a value that is neither `nil'
;;    nor `t'.  That displays `*Completions*' as soon as you type or
;;    delete input, but not initially.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-incremental-completion' controls whether or
;;    not `*Completions*' is updated incrementally (icompletion) as
;;    you type.  You can cycle the option among its three possible
;;    values at any time using `C-#'.  For more information, see
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;    Note: Several tripping (navigating) commands, including Icicles
;;    search commands, bind option `icicle-incremental-completion' to
;;    `always', because I think you typically want to start them out
;;    with incremental completion turned on.  Remember that you can
;;    use `C-#' (once or twice) to turn incremental completion off.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-incremental-completion-delay' and
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion-threshold' together cause a delay
;;    before incremental completion takes effect.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sorting-max-candidates' automatically
;;    toggles candidate sorting off and on, depending on the current
;;    number of candidates.  Set it to `nil' to turn off such
;;    toggling.  Set it to a larger or smaller maximum number of
;;    candidates to reduce or increase its effect.  See also
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Different Sorts for Different Sorts of Uses").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-icomplete-mode-max-candidates' automatically
;;    toggles Icomplete mode off and on, depending on the current
;;    number of candidates.  Set it to `nil' to turn off such
;;    toggling.  Set it to a larger or smaller maximum number of
;;    candidates to reduce or increase its effect.  This option has no
;;    effect for Emacs versions prior to Emacs 23.  See also
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Using Icicles with Icomplete Mode").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars' is the
;;    minimum number of input characters that allow buffer
;;    `*Completions*' to remain displayed.  By default, this is zero
;;    (0), meaning that any number of input characters, even none,
;;    allows `*Completions*' to remain displayed.  If you use
;;    incremental completion (see `icicle-incremental-completion-*'),
;;    and you are bothered by `*Completions*' being automatically
;;    updated when, for instance, you empty the minibuffer, then you
;;    might want to set this option to, say, 1 or 2.  With a value of
;;    2, for instance, whenever the minibuffer input has less than 2
;;    characters, incremental completion will remove the
;;    `*Completions*' window.  You can also remove the `*Completions*'
;;    window at any time using `C-x 0' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-keep-Completions-for-sole-dir' controls what
;;    happens during (non-absolute) file-name completion when the only
;;    match for your input is a directory name.  If the value is `nil'
;;    then remove the `*Completions*' window.  If it is the symbol
;;    `pop-up' then update `*Completions*' unconditionally to show the
;;    sole candidate - show `*Completions*' if it was not yet showing.
;;    If it is any other non-`nil' value then update `*Completions*'
;;    if it is showing, and do nothing otherwise.  The default value
;;    is `t', giving this update-if-shown-else-remove behavior.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-show-Completions-help-flag' means
;;    display help (instructions) at the top of the buffer that shows
;;    completions (typically `*Completions*').  These instructions are
;;    shown in faces `icicle-Completions-instruction-1' and
;;    `icicle-Completions-instruction-2'.  If `nil', the completion
;;    candidates are shown alone (no help text), but if there are no
;;    candidates then text stating that fact is printed in the buffer.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay' is the number of seconds
;;    to display help on individual completion candidates in the
;;    mode-line as you cycle or your input is completed.  The
;;    mode-line that is used is that of buffer `*Completions*', if it
;;    is displayed, or the current buffer, otherwise.  Typically, this
;;    mode-line candidate help is the first line of a doc string, but
;;    alternative help is available.

;;    Regardless of the option value, a user event (e.g. a key press)
;;    always interrupts (terminates) this help display.
;;
;;    Note that `post-command-hook' actions do not take place until
;;    this display is finished.  For example, if the help is shown
;;    because your input is complete, then Icomplete will not show
;;    additional candidates (e.g. with the same input as a prefix)
;;    until the mode-line help has finished.  This is because
;;    Icomplete display is a `post-command-hook' action.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-mode-line-help' is used to highlight Icicles help
;;    shown in the mode-line.  This includes that controlled by option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay' and the indication in
;;    `*Completions*' of the total number of matching candidates.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-mouse-3-menu-entries' defines
;;    the contextual menu that is popped up when you click `C-mouse-3'
;;    on a candidate in `*Completions*'.  As an aid to customizing it,
;;    refer to any of the constants `icicle-Completions-*' that define
;;    its submenus.  The submenu definitions are easier to understand
;;    in the source code (`icicles-opt.el'), because Customize does
;;    not pretty-print them.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-move-Completions-frame' means that
;;    `icicle-candidate-action' moves the frame showing buffer
;;    `*Completions*' to the edge of the display, out of the way of
;;    other frames.  The possible non-`nil' values are `right' and
;;    `left', specifying the display edge to use.
;;
;;    This option can be useful if you use one-buffer-per-frame
;;    (non-`nil' `pop-up-frames').  In that case, I recommend that you
;;    also try my library `oneonone.el'.  See
;;    (@> "Note on Non-`nil' `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows") for more
;;    advice about non-`nil' `pop-up-frames'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-Completions-window-max-height' is the
;;    maximum height of the `*Completions*' window, in lines.  The
;;    window is fit to the buffer size, with this as maximum height.
;;    This is not used if `*Completions*' is a special display buffer
;;    with its own frame, and it is not used in Emacs releases prior
;;    to 21.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23, you can use option
;;    `icicle-Completions-text-scale-decrease' to change the size of
;;    the text used in buffer `*Completions*'.  (This option has no
;;    effect for terminal Emacs.  It is used only for graphic display
;;    (GUI Emacs).)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-candidate-width-factor' controls how many
;;    columns of completion candidates are displayed in
;;    `*Completions*'.  The widest current candidate is scaled by this
;;    percentage, and the window width is divided by that figure.
;;    Other things are taken into account also, but this gives you a
;;    way to tweak the number of columns: the larger this number, the
;;    fewer the columns.
;;
;;    If you use Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el'), then you can modify
;;    `icicle-candidate-width-factor' incrementally during completion,
;;    seeing the effect as it changes.  Use `C-x w' from the
;;    minibuffer, then use the `right' and `left' arrow keys or the
;;    mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at
;;    the same time use the `up' and `down' keys to adjust the value
;;    of `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces'.  WYSIWYG.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' is the minimum
;;    number of spaces between candidates displayed in
;;    `*Completions*'.  The default value is one space.
;;
;;    If you use Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el'), then you can modify
;;    `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' incrementally during
;;    completion, seeing the effect as it changes.  Use `C-x |' from
;;    the minibuffer, then use the `up' and `down' arrow keys or the
;;    mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at
;;    the same time use the `left' and `right' keys to adjust the
;;    value of `icicle-candidate-width-factor'.  WYSIWYG.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-Completions-max-columns' imposes a maximum number
;;    of columns for the `*Completions*' display, thus preventing
;;    Icicles from automatically calculating the number of columns.
;;    It is available in case you really want to do that, but I
;;    recommend that you leave the value of this option `nil' and you
;;    use only options `icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' and
;;    `icicle-candidate-width-factor' to control columns and candidate
;;    spacing.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-image-files-in-Completions' means that
;;    thumbnail images are shown in `*Completions*' for candidates
;;    that are either (relative or absolute) names of image files or
;;    names of image-file bookmarks (see Bookmark+).  The default
;;    value is `t'.  If the value is `image-only', then only the
;;    thumbnail images are shown.  If it is otherwise non-`nil' then
;;    the file names are also shown.  You can cycle the option value
;;    using `C-x t' in the minibuffer at any time during completion.
;;    This feature is available starting with Emacs 22.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip' means that if
;;    `tooltip-mode' is on then passing the mouse over an image-file
;;    candidate in `*Completions*' can pop up a tooltip showing a
;;    preview of the image.  If the value is `full' then a full-size
;;    image is shown.  If the value is a positive integer then a
;;    thumbnail image of that size is shown.  However, thumbnail
;;    tooltips are not shown if thumbnails are already shown in
;;    `*Completions*', that is, if `icicle-image-files-in-Completions'
;;    is non-`nil' and `icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip' is not
;;    `full'.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-completions-format' controls whether candidates
;;    displayed in `*Completions*' are laid out horizontally (the
;;    default) or vertically.  Set the value to `vertical' for the
;;    latter.  Starting with Emacs 23.2, you can just use the vanilla
;;    option `completions-format' for this, if you want the same type
;;    of layout with Icicle mode turned on or off.
;;
;;    Icicles always displays multi-line candidates in a single
;;    column, for readability.  When this is the case, the completions
;;    format (horizontal or vertical) makes no difference - the effect
;;    is the same.  (Icicles also inserts an empty line after each
;;    multi-line candidate, for readability.)
;;
;;    You can toggle the completions layout between horizontal and
;;    vertical at any time during completion, using `C-M-^'.
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag' is non-`nil' (the
;;    default), then commands that you invoke using the menu-bar menu
;;    are included in the command history for `M-x'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag'
;;    means that any interactive use of a command causes it to be
;;    added to the history `icicle-interactive-history'.  You can
;;    access this history by using `C-M-pause' during completion.  Be
;;    aware that addition of all interactive invocations to this
;;    history can slow Emacs down.  (This option is only available
;;    starting with Emacs 23.)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-comparer' controls the order of
;;    completion candidates during cycling and in buffer
;;    `*Completions*'.  If `nil', then no sorting is done.  If
;;    non-`nil', then the value must be a string-comparison function -
;;    the function is passed to the standard function `sort' to do the
;;    sorting.  The default value for `icicle-sort-comparer' is
;;    `icicle-case-string-less-p', which sorts alphabetically,
;;    possibly ignoring letter case.  During completion, you can
;;    toggle sorting using `C-,'.  If you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer
;;    and you write new commands using Icicles functionalities, you
;;    can bind `icicle-sort-comparer' temporarily to any sort function
;;    you need.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-alternative-sort-comparer' is an alternative
;;    to `icicle-sort-comparer, providing a different sort order.  By
;;    default, it is `icicle-historical-alphabetic-p', a function that
;;    sorts previously used completion candidates before candidates
;;    that have not yet been used, and sorts alphabetically within
;;    each of these groups of candidates.  In other words, it places
;;    inputs that you have used previously at the top of buffer
;;    `*Completions*' and makes them available for completion first.
;;    During completion, you can toggle normal and alternative sorting
;;    using `C-M-,'.  See (@> "Sorting Candidates") and
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-change-sort-order-completion' specifies
;;    whether `C-,' and `M-,' cycle among available sort orders or
;;    they let you choose a sort order using Icicles completion.  The
;;    default value is 7, meaning cycle to the next order if there are
;;    no more than 7 sort orders currently available, but use
;;    completion to choose a sort order if there more than 7.  An
;;    option value of `nil' means always cycle, and a non-integer,
;;    non-`nil' value means always complete.  However, you can
;;    override the current option setting at any time by using a plain
;;    prefix argument: `C-u C-,' or `C-u M-,'.
;;    See (@> "Sorting Candidates").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-sort-orders-alist' is an alist of possible
;;    sort orders for user to choose from using `C-,' or `M-,'.
;;    See (@> "Sorting Candidates").
;;
;;  * The value of user option `icicle-transform-function' is a
;;    function that is applied to the list of completion candidates,
;;    to transform them before they are presented to the user.  If
;;    `nil', then no transformation is done.  The default
;;    transformation is to remove duplicate candidates, when
;;    transformation is active, but the default value of this option
;;    is `nil'.  You can toggle transformation at any time using
;;    command `icicle-toggle-transforming', bound to `C-$' in the
;;    minibuffer.  Although this is a user option, you probably do
;;    *NOT* want to change its value by customizing it.  Icicles
;;    commands already "do the right thing" when it comes to candidate
;;    transformation.
;;
;;    The value of this option can be changed by program locally, for
;;    use in particular contexts.  For example, when you use
;;    `icicle-search-generic' (`M-s M-s M-s' or `C-c `') in a *shell*
;;    buffer, Icicles uses this variable with a value of
;;    `icicle-remove-duplicates', to remove duplicate shell commands
;;    from your input history list.  Lisp programmers can use this
;;    variable to transform the list of candidates in any way they
;;    like.  A typical use is to remove duplicates, by binding it to
;;    `icicle-remove-duplicates' or `icicle-remove-dups-if-extras'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-require-match-flag',
;;    `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag', and
;;    `icicle-file-require-match-flag' let you override the value of
;;    the REQUIRE-MATCH argument provided to `completing-read' or
;;    `read-file-name'.  They are provided mainly for use (binding) in
;;    `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command', but
;;    you may also use them globally, if you wish.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation").
;;
;;    A typical use is made in the definition of command
;;    `icicle-buffer': `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' is used to
;;    bind `icicle-require-match-flag', so that you can, for example,
;;    match only existing buffers and be able to match on partial
;;    input without explicitly completing (hitting `TAB' or `S-TAB').
;;    Simply set the option to `partial-match-ok' to get this
;;    behavior.  To apropos-complete and exit the minibuffer, use
;;    `S-RET' instead of `RET'.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Exiting the Minibuffer Without Confirmation"),
;;    for more information.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag'
;;    means to ignore buffer-name completion candidates that start
;;    with a space.  You can toggle
;;    `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' using `M-_' in the
;;    minibuffer (except during `icicle-search').
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag' means
;;    that Icicles tests for remote file names; `nil' means that it
;;    does not.  You can toggle this using `C-^' in the minibuffer
;;    (except during Icicles search).  Turning off remote file-name
;;    testing means that you cannot use remote files with Tramp; it
;;    disables Tramp's remote file-name handling and completion.  This
;;    can, for local files, slightly speed up incremental completion
;;    and the highlighting of the part of your current input that does
;;    not complete (see `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure').
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag'
;;    means that a file on a mapped MS Windows network drive is
;;    considered remote.  This has an effect on things like
;;    incremental completion.  You can toggle this option anytime
;;    during completion using `C-x :'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-regexp-quote-flag' reduces apropos
;;    completion to simple substring completion and Icicles regexp
;;    search to literal search.  Regexp special characters are no
;;    longer recognized as special; they simply match themselves.  You
;;    probably do not want to customize this option.  Instead, you can
;;    toggle it at any time using `C-`' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-command-abbrev-match-all-parts-flag',
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-priority-flag', and
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-alist' control the behavior of
;;    multi-command `icicle-command-abbrev' (`M-ESC C-x', aka `ESC ESC
;;    C-x').  The first option determines whether an abbreviation must
;;    match all parts of a command name.  The second controls whether
;;    command names or abbreviations take precedence in case of
;;    conflict.  The third is the persistent list of your command
;;    abbreviations.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' and
;;    `icicle-TAB-completion-methods' control which completion method
;;    is used by `S-TAB' and `TAB', respectively, to complete your
;;    input.  By default, the first method in each list is used for
;;    matching.  You can use `M-(' and `C-(' (commands
;;    `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method' and
;;    `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') in the minibuffer to cycle
;;    among the `S-TAB' and `TAB' methods.
;;
;;    For fuzzy completion (choice `fuzzy' when cycling with `C-('),
;;    `TAB' completes non-filename input using fuzzy prefix matching
;;    as defined in library `fuzzy-match.el'.  See the Commentary in
;;    `fuzzy-match.el' for details about fuzzy matching.
;;
;;    Fuzzy completion is not available for file-name completion; it
;;    is always case-sensitive; leading spaces are taken into account;
;;    and completion candidates are always sorted by decreasing fuzzy
;;    match strength.  In other words, fuzzy completion is not
;;    affected by `C-A', `M-_', or `C-,'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-per-command' and
;;    `icicle-TAB-completion-methods-per-command' provide per-command
;;    control of the completion methods available when you cycle using
;;    `C-(' and `M-('.  Use them if you want to specify which methods
;;    are available for particular commands that read input with
;;    completion.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completion-style-sets' (for Emacs 23 or
;;    later) is the set of `completion-styles' values that can be used
;;    when `TAB' completion method is `vanilla'.  During completion
;;    you can use `C-M-(' to cycle to the next the style set.  You can
;;    use command `icicle-choose-completion-style-set' anytime to
;;    choose the default style set and set option `completion-styles'
;;    to it.  With a prefix argument, the command also saves the new
;;    `completion-styles' value.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-levenshtein-distance' is the Levenshtein
;;    distance allowed for strings to be considered as matching during
;;    N-off completion.  This means that two strings match if they
;;    differ by at most this many character operations (insertion,
;;    deletion, replacement).  This option is used only if you have
;;    library `levenshtein.el'.
;;    See (@> "Completion Methods and Styles").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-swank-timeout' is the maximumum number of
;;    milliseconds that can elapse before swank (fuzzy symbol)
;;    completion gives up.  If you use Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el')
;;    then you can use multi-command `icicle-increment-option' anytime
;;    to change the option value incrementally.
;;    See (@> "Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-swank-prefix-length' is the minimum number
;;    of characters that must match, for swank completion.  If you use
;;    Do Re Mi (library `doremi.el') then you can use multi-command
;;    `icicle-increment-option' anytime to change the option value
;;    incrementally.  See (@> "Swank (Fuzzy Symbol) Completion").
;;
;;  * Top-level command `icicle-search' uses several faces to
;;    highlight found text that matches your input.  Faces
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-current' and
;;    `icicle-search-main-regexp-others' highlight what your
;;    search-context regexp (entered with `RET') matches.  The former
;;    highlights the current search context; the latter highlights all
;;    other search contexts.
;;
;;    Face `icicle-search-current-input' highlights what your current
;;    input (typically another regexp) matches; that is, it highlights
;;    a match within a search context.  Faces
;;    `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;    `icicle-search-context-level-8' highlight the first eight regexp
;;    subgroup matches, within a search context.  This highlighting is
;;    done whenever `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag' is
;;    non-`nil' and the search context corresponds to the entire
;;    regexp.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag'
;;    controls highlighting of regexp subgroup matches within the
;;    search context.  Non-`nil' (the default value) means highlight
;;    them.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' controls
;;    highlighting with face `icicle-search-main-regexp-others': this
;;    many matches, maximum, are highlighted.  If `t' then there is no
;;    maximum (no limit).  If zero, then only the current match is
;;    highlighted.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    means highlight the current input match in all main search hits
;;    at the same time.  If `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' is 3
;;    or 4 (which means your input can be automatically
;;    prefix-expanded or apropos-expanded, respectively), then what is
;;    highlighted for each input match is the expanded common match
;;    among all input matches throughout the search area.  Otherwise,
;;    only the exact input match is highlighted.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag'
;;    is `nil', because non-`nil' can impact performance negatively if
;;    there are many search contexts - the highlighting is updated
;;    with each input change.  You can toggle the value at any time
;;    using command `icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to
;;    `C-^' in the minibuffer during Icicles search.
;;
;;  * If, in addition to `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' causing
;;    your input to be expanded and
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' being non-`nil',
;;    option `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' is also
;;    non-`nil', then a search replacement replaces the expanded
;;    common match.  Otherwise, it replaces only the exact match.  You
;;    can toggle `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' at any time
;;    using `M-;' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-search' highlighting is removed after the search.  This
;;    is the default behavior.  If you set this to `nil' then you can
;;    remove search highlighting manually later using command
;;    `icicle-search-highlight-cleanup'.  You can toggle this search
;;    highlight removal at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', which is bound to `C-.' in the
;;    minibuffer during Icicles search.
;;
;;    One use of `nil' `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to highlight
;;    regexp matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files
;;    or...).  In that capacity, Icicles search functions act like
;;    some of the highlighting commands in my library `highlight.el'.
;;    Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is `nil', *all*
;;    Icicles search highlighting remains: last-visited search
;;    context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
;;    regexp subgroups.  The faces for these are, respectively:
;;
;;     - `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'
;;     - `icicle-search-main-regexp-others'
;;     - `icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here' (everywhere, if
;;       `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-`nil')
;;     - `icicle-search-context-level-1' through
;;       `icicle-search-context-level-8'
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-search-whole-word-flag' means that
;;    whole-word search is done.  You can use `M-q' while searching to
;;    toggle this option; the new value takes effect for the next
;;    complete search.
;;
;;    Whole-word searching here means that matches can contain
;;    embedded strings of non word-constituent chars (they are skipped
;;    over, when matching, included in the match), and any leading or
;;    trailing word-constituent chars in the search string are dropped
;;    (ignored for matching, not included in the match).  This means,
;;    for instance, that you can match `foo-bar' as a word, even in
;;    contexts (such as Emacs Lisp) where `-' is not a
;;    word-constituent character.  Similarly, you can include embedded
;;    whitespace in a "word", e.g., `foo bar'.
;;
;;    See also (@> "Icicles Search Commands, Overview").
;;
;;  * If user option `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is
;;    `nil', then whatever matches your current input is replaced,
;;    within the current search context, when you perform replacement
;;    during Icicles searching (e.g. `C-S-RET').  If the value is
;;    non-`nil' (the default value), then the entire search context is
;;    replaced, instead.  You can use `M-_' at any time during
;;    searching and replacing, to toggle the value.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-replace-literally-flag' determines
;;    whether Icicles search-and-replace replaces text literally or
;;    interprets `\' specially in the replacement text, as in
;;    `query-replace-regexp'.  Non-`nil' means to treat replacement
;;    text literally.  The default value is `nil'.  You can use
;;    `C-M-`' to toggle this at any time during Icicles search.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-ignore-comments-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-search-thing' and related commands
;;    (e.g. `icicle-search-xml-element') ignore comments.  That is,
;;    they hide comments temporarily while they scan the region or
;;    buffer for things of the given type to serve as search contexts
;;    (completion candidates).  This prevents them, for example, from
;;    presenting as a candidate a sexp or a list that is commented
;;    out.  You can toggle this option anytime using `C-M-;' in the
;;    minibuffer, but to see the effect you might need to invoke the
;;    current command again.  See also option
;;    `icicle-hide-whitespace-before-comment-flag' (next).
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-hide-whitespace-before-comment-flag'
;;    means that hiding comments (see option
;;    `icicle-ignore-comments-flag') also hides whitespace preceding a
;;    comment.  Empty lines (newline chars) are not hidden, however.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-search-hook' is a list of functions to be
;;    run after searching and moving to an `icicle-search' match,
;;    whether you move there by `RET', `C-RET', `C-next', or
;;    `C-prior'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-recenter' is passed as argument to
;;    `recenter' whenever the current navigation destination would be
;;    off-screen, to make it visible.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-bookmark-name-length-max' is the maximum
;;    number of characters to use when `icicle-bookmark-cmd' (`C-x r
;;    m') with a non-negative numeric prefix argument automatically
;;    names a bookmark.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag' determines
;;    whether commands such as `icicle-bookmark' and
;;    `icicle-search-bookmark' refresh the bookmark-list cache.  The
;;    default value of `t', meaning refresh, ensures that the set of
;;    bookmark candidates is always up-to-date, but you can improve
;;    performance for a large bookmark list if you customize it to
;;    `nil'.
;;
;;    In any case, a plain prefix argument (`C-u') for these commands
;;    overrides the default setting of the option for the duration of
;;    the command.  Thus if the customized value is `nil', you can use
;;    `C-u' occasionally to refresh the list on demand.  In addition,
;;    the cache is refreshed whenever you use `S-delete' to delete a
;;    candidate bookmark.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate', and
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras' determine the behavior of Icicles buffer
;;    commands, such as `icicle-buffer' and `insert-buffer'.  They
;;    determine the set of buffer-name candidates available for
;;    completion.
;;
;;    The first three restrict this set to names that satisfy the
;;    properties they specify.  Option `icicle-buffer-extras' lets you
;;    add additional buffer names to the set of candidates, after
;;    restriction by the other options.  Extra buffer-name candidates
;;    are displayed in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;    `icicle-extra-candidate'.
;;
;;    Note that if an extra candidate is already a candidate anyway
;;    then it will be present twice in the list of all candidates
;;    (that is, unless `icicle-transform-function' removes duplicate
;;    candidates).
;;
;;    Note that `icicle-buffer-predicate' is applied after matching
;;    against user input.  It thus corresponds to
;;    `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate', not to
;;    `icicle-must-pass-predicate'.
;;
;;    Options `icicle-file-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-file-no-match-regexp', `icicle-file-predicate', and
;;    `icicle-file-extras' act similarly for file-name completion.
;;    You could use `icicle-file-no-match-regexp' or
;;    `icicle-file-predicate', for instance, to exclude files that are
;;    in or under the directories in `vc-directory-exclusion-list':
;;
;;    (defun my-locate-non-vc-file ()
;;      "`icicle-locate-file', but excluding stuff in VC directories."
;;      (interactive)
;;      (let ((icicle-file-predicate  'not-excluded-vc-file-p))
;;        (icicle-locate-file)))
;;
;;    (defun not-excluded-vc-file-p (file)
;;      "nil if FILE is in a `vc-directory-exclusion-list' directory."
;;      (or (not (boundp 'vc-directory-exclusion-list))
;;          (not (consp vc-directory-exclusion-list))
;;          (not (let ((case-fold-search  completion-ignore-case))
;;                 (catch 'nevfp
;;                   (dolist (dir  vc-directory-exclusion-list)
;;                     (when (string-match
;;                            (concat ".*" dir "\\(/.*\\)?")
;;                            file)
;;                       (throw 'nevfp t)))
;;                   nil)))))
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-buffer-prefix-arg-filtering' defines the
;;    prefix-argument filtering behavior for Icicles buffer commands.
;;    It lets you choose what any given prefix argument (including
;;    lack of a prefix argument) does to filter buffer-name completion
;;    candidates.
;;
;;  * Options `icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag' and
;;    `icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag' also determine the
;;    behavior of commands `icicle-buffer' (`C-x b')
;;    and`icicle-buffer-other-window' (`C-x 4 b').  They determine
;;    whether the candidates available for completion include not only
;;    existing buffer names but also the names of certain files that
;;    are not currently visited.
;;
;;    For the former, these are the names cached by the Emacs
;;    file-name cache.  For the latter, these are the names of
;;    recently visited files.  See the Emacs manual, nodes `File Name
;;    Cache' and `File Conveniences', respectively.
;;
;;    You can toggle these options using `C-x F' and `C-x R',
;;    respectively, during buffer-name completion.
;;
;;    The option values are not exactly Boolean, however.  They are in
;;    fact non-zero integer values.  Each option is turned on when
;;    positive and off when negative.  The absolute value of the
;;    option is the maximum number of such candidates to include when
;;    turned on.  So for example, if the latter option value is 20,
;;    then the names of only the twenty most recently visited files
;;    are candidates.
;;
;;    A prefix argument to `C-x F' or `C-x R' sets the option value to
;;    the numeric prefix argument value.
;;
;;  * Options `icicle-buffer-skip-functions' and
;;    `icicle-file-skip-functions' are lists of hook functions.  They
;;    are used by commands that read buffer names or file names (for
;;    Emacs 23 and later) to test a candidate buffer name or file
;;    name, respectively.  You can use them to skip content-searching
;;    of certain buffers and files when completing buffer and file
;;    names using multi-completion.
;;
;;    The functions are passed to `run-hook-with-args-until-success',
;;    so they are called in order until one returns non-`nil'.  If any
;;    function returns non-`nil' then the buffer or file content is
;;    not searched.  This is relevant only when your multi-completion
;;    input has a second, content-matching part.
;;
;;  * If options `icicle-file-search-dir-as-dired-flag' and
;;    `find-file-run-dired' are both non-`nil', and if your input to
;;    an Icicles file-finding command such as `icicle-file' has a
;;    content-matching part, then completion of a directory name
;;    visits the directory in Dired mode, and the Dired listing is
;;    searched as the content.  Otherwise, the content-matching part
;;    is ignored for a directory-name candidate.  By default,
;;    `icicle-file-search-dir-as-dired-flag' is `nil', preventing such
;;    searching.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-ignored-directories' is a list of directories
;;    that are ignored by various Icicles commands, including
;;    `icicle-locate-file'.  By default, this is the value of
;;    `vc-directory-exclusion-list'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-sort' is a predicate used to sort
;;    buffer-name candidates in Icicles buffer commands such as
;;    `icicle-buffer' and `icicle-insert-buffer'.  Option
;;    `icicle-file-sort' acts similarly for file-name completion.  The
;;    default value of `icicle-buffer-sort' is
;;    `icicle-buffer-sort-*...*-last', which sorts names of buffers
;;    that begin with `*' after other buffer names.  These options
;;    affect only the initial sort order used for buffer and file
;;    names, respectively, that is, the order used first in an Emacs
;;    session.  The values are also put first in the list of possible
;;    sort orders for cycling.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-buffer-configs' is a list of named
;;    configurations of options `icicle-buffer-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp', `icicle-buffer-predicate',
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras', and `icicle-buffer-sort'.  You use
;;    command `icicle-buffer-config' to choose one of the
;;    configurations to be current.  You can use commands
;;    `icicle-add-buffer-config' and `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to
;;    add and remove configurations from the list.
;;
;;    Example: A configuration such as the following, named "Files and
;;    Scratch", defines `icicle-buffer-predicate' to display only file
;;    buffers, and it defines `icicle-buffer-extras' to include the
;;    extra buffer `*scratch*':
;;
;;     ("Files and Scratch" nil nil
;;      (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
;;      ("*scratch*") icicle-sort-comparer)
;;
;;    The idea of buffer-option configurations was borrowed from
;;    library `bs.el', by Olaf Sylvester <olaf@geekware.de>.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-dot-string' is the regexp string inserted by
;;    `icicle-insert-dot-command' (bound to `.' in the minibuffer
;;    during completion).  You can set it to a regexp that matches any
;;    character, including newline.  The default value instead matches
;;    any character except newline.  You can toggle between these two
;;    behaviors using command `icicle-toggle-dot', bound to `C-M-.'
;;    during completion.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag' means show the
;;    underlying regexp (value of constant `icicle-anychar-regexp')
;;    explicitly for a multi-line dot (`.').  A `nil' value works only
;;    for Emacs versions 21 and later.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-show-annotations-flag' means show
;;    annotations, when available, next to candidates in
;;    `*Completions*'.  You can toggle this option from the minibuffer
;;    using `C-x C-a'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-show-multi-completion-flag' means
;;    that for some commands additional information is shown along
;;    with each completion candidate.  That is, a multi-completion is
;;    used.  You can match against any parts of the multi-completion.
;;    The default value is `t'.  (By contrast, you cannot match the
;;    text controlled by option `icicle-show-annotations-flag'.)
;;
;;    For example, for command `icicle-search', the name of the buffer
;;    associated with each completion candidate is added to the
;;    candidate and highlighted.  You can match against the buffer
;;    name, as well as the search hit within the buffer.
;;
;;    Note that even when the value of this option is `nil', you can
;;    often see the multi-completion information in the mode-line when
;;    you cycle candidates, and you can typically see it in the help
;;    that is displayed by `C-M-mouse-2' and so on.
;;
;;    You can toggle this option from the minibuffer using `M-m'.  The
;;    new value takes effect after you exit the minibuffer (i.e., for
;;    the next command).
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-kill-visited-buffers-flag' means
;;    kill buffers visited temporarily to search files.  This applies
;;    to commands such as `icicle-file' (for Emacs 23 or later), which
;;    search files that match your completion input.  If non-`nil'
;;    then any such buffers for files that you do not actually choose
;;    are killed when the command is finished.  If `nil' then they are
;;    not killed.  This option applies only to Emacs 23 and later.
;;
;;  * When `icicle-auto-complete-keys-mode' is enabled, user option
;;    `icicle-auto-complete-key-delay' is the number of seconds
;;    Icicles waits, before displaying key completions.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-complete-keys-separator' is the string that
;;    separates the two parts (key description and command name) of a
;;    key completion candidate during key completion.  The default
;;    value is "  =  ".  You could, for example, change this to, say,
;;    Unicode character RIGHT ARROW.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-list-join-string' and
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' are described in sections
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Completions")
;;    and (@> "Programming Multi-Completions").
;;    Option `icicle-list-join-string' is the separator string that
;;    joins together the parts of a multi-completion.  The end string
;;    is appended to each multi-completion candidate.  Option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' specifies how the
;;    multi-completion extracted parts are joined back together when a
;;    user chooses a multi-completion.
;;
;;    The default value of `icicle-list-join-string' is `^G^J'.  With
;;    Emacs 22 and later, the `^G' part is hidden when it appears in
;;    `*Completions*', and you can hide it in the minibuffer also by
;;    using `C-M-j' instead of typing `C-q C-g C-j'.  See the doc
;;    string for more information.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-candidate-part' highlights one or more parts of a
;;    candidate, in buffer `*Completions*'.  The candidate is
;;    typically a multi-completion.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-special-candidate' highlights candidates, in
;;    `*Completions*', that are considered "special".  Generally,
;;    these are candidates that match user option
;;    `icicle-special-candidate-regexp'.
;;
;;  * Faces `icicle-key-complete-menu-local' and
;;    `icicle-key-complete-menu' highlight menu items during key
;;    completion.  The former is for local menu items (i.e., specific
;;    to the current mode).  The latter is for non-local menu items.
;;
;;  * Similarly, face `icicle-proxy-candidate' highlights proxy
;;    candidates.  These are placeholders for real candidates.
;;    Non-`nil' user option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' means
;;    include proxy candidates whenever there are any.  You can toggle
;;    this option during completion using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-proxy-candidates', which is bound to `C-M-_' in
;;    the minibuffer.  For performance reasons, you will in some cases
;;    need to re-invoke the command to make the proxy candidates
;;    available.
;;
;;  * Face `icicle-extra-candidate' highlights extra candidates, that
;;    is, members of `icicle-extra-candidates', `icicle-buffer-extras',
;;    or `icicle-file-extras'.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-kmacro-ring-max' acts as `kmacro-ring-max'
;;    when you are in Icicle mode.  (When you exit Icicle mode,
;;    `kmacro-ring-max' is restored.)  In Icicles, you will typically
;;    want to use a much larger number than the default value in
;;    vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `icicle-search-ring-max' act as `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max', respectively, when you are in Icicle mode.
;;    (When you exit Icicle mode, `regexp-search-ring-max' and
;;    `search-ring-max' are restored.)  The reason for having these
;;    options is that with Icicles you will likely want to use a much
;;    longer search history.  By default, these are as large as
;;    possible (virtually unlimited).
;;
;;    Suggestion: If you use library `savehist.el' (recommended),
;;    customize `savehist-additional-variables' to include variables
;;    `search-ring' and `regexp-search-ring', so that your search
;;    histories will be saved between Emacs sessions.
;;
;;    Note: You can clear (empty) a given search history with command
;;    `clear-option' (aka `icicle-reset-option-to-nil').  For example,
;;    to clear the regular-expression search history, do this:
;;
;;      `C-u M-x clear-option RET regexp-search-ring RET'
;;
;;    (The `C-u' is needed because this variable is not a user
;;    option.)  If you use my library `misc-cmds.el', you can clear
;;    search histories easier, using commands `clear-search-history',
;;    `clear-regexp-search-history', and `clear-search-histories'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Isearch Completion").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-completion-history-max-length' limits the
;;    number of completion inputs to save.  If you customize user
;;    option `icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' to non-`nil', then,
;;    instead of cycling, `C-l' lets you use Icicles completion to
;;    retrieve a past completion input.  (`C-L' does the same thing.)
;;    If you use library `savehist.el', then you can save the history
;;    of completion inputs persistently by customizing user option
;;    `savehist-additional-variables' to include the Icicles internal
;;    variables `icicle-previous-raw-file-name-inputs' and
;;    `icicle-previous-raw-non-file-name-inputs'.
;;
;;  * Faces `icicle-completion', `icicle-multi-command-completion',
;;    and `icicle-mustmatch-completion' indicate the status of
;;    minibuffer completion.  During completion, Icicles uses them for
;;    a minibuffer indicator and, if user option
;;    `icicle-highlight-lighter-flag' is non-`nil', for the `Icy'
;;    mode-line lighter as well.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag' uses face
;;    `icicle-whitespace-highlight' to highlight any whitespace that
;;    starts your minibuffer input.  This is done to help you
;;    recognize accidentally typing such whitespace.  Otherwise, you
;;    might not understand the set of matching completion candidates
;;    (or lack thereof).  There is not necessarily anything wrong with
;;    input that starts with whitespace - it might be what you want,
;;    but without this highlighting it is easy to not notice the
;;    whitespace.
;;
;;  * The part of your current input that does not complete can be
;;    highlighted automatically, and you can then remove that part
;;    using `C-M-l'.  This highlighting is controlled by options
;;    `icicle-incremental-completion',
;;    `icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag',
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure',
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay', and
;;    `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold'.  The
;;    highlighting uses face `icicle-input-completion-fail' (for
;;    strict completion) or `icicle-input-completion-fail-lax' (for
;;    lax completion).  For details, see the option doc strings and
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Highlights the Input that Won't Complete").
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-define-alias-commands-flag' defines a
;;    few top-level Icicles commands whose names do not begin with
;;    `icicle-', for convenience when using `M-x'.  For example,
;;    command `toggle' is defined as an alias for command
;;    `icicle-toggle-option'.  In any case, no such command is ever
;;    defined by Icicles if a function with the same name is already
;;    defined.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-color-themes' is a list of color themes to
;;    cycle through when you use command `icicle-color-theme'.  You
;;    need library `color-theme.el' to use this command.
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-custom-themes' is a list of Emacs custom themes
;;    to cycle through when you use command `icicle-custom-theme'.
;;    (This is available only for Emacs 24 and later.)  Option
;;    `icicle-custom-themes-accumulate-flag' determines whether such
;;    cycling keeps the effects of previously applied themes or
;;    replaces each theme with the next one.  Option
;;    `icicle-custom-themes-update-flag' determines whether the
;;    command automatically saves changes made.  A prefix argument
;;    flips this option value for the invocation of the command.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-saved-completion-sets' is a persistent list
;;    of named sets of completion candidates.  You can switch among
;;    such sets at any time.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Persistent Sets of Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-filesets-as-saved-completion-sets-flag'
;;    non-`nil' means you can use Emacs filesets to save completion
;;    candidates persistently.  This means that you can save file-name
;;    candidates in a persistent Icicles saved completion set (cache
;;    file) or in in an Emacs fileset.  It also means that an Icicles
;;    persistent completion set can contain filesets, in addition to
;;    file names: any number of filesets, and filesets of different
;;    type.  Available only for Emacs 22 and later, and you must load
;;    library `filesets.el' (and enable filesets using
;;    `(filesets-init)').
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag' (aka
;;    `icicle-key-descriptions-use-angle-brackets-flag') determines
;;    whether angle brackets (`<', `>') are used by Icicles for named
;;    keys, such as function keys (`<f9>' vs `f9') and pseudo keys
;;    (`<mode-line>' vs `mode-line').  Non-`nil' means to use angle
;;    brackets.  This option does not affect Emacs key descriptions
;;    outside of Icicles, and it has no effect for versions of Emacs
;;    prior to 21, because they never use angle brackets.  The default
;;    value is `nil', because I think angle brackets reduce
;;    readability.  See also my library `naked.el', which lets you use
;;    the no-angle-brackets style also outside of Icicles.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion' is a list of
;;    variables that are bound to keymaps in which you want to bind
;;    `S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
;;    `icicle-key-complete-keys') to `icicle-complete-keys'.  Each
;;    such keymap should have at least one prefix key.  `S-TAB' is
;;    bound in each keymap, so that you can use it to complete the
;;    prefix keys.  See also `icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag'.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag' means bind
;;    `S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
;;    `icicle-key-complete-keys') to `icicle-complete-keys' in each
;;    keymap of option `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion', regardless
;;    of whether `S-TAB' already has a binding in that keymap.  A
;;    value of `nil' (the default value) means bind `S-TAB' only if
;;    there is not already a binding for it.  For example, by default
;;    `icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion' includes `help-mode-map'.
;;    If you customize `icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag' to `t' then
;;    `S-TAB' in `*Help*' buffers completes keys, instead of moving
;;    backward to the previous button.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-ranges' means
;;    that `icicle-complete-keys' includes some self-inserting keys as
;;    completion candidates.  You will probably want to leave this
;;    `nil'.  This option has no effect before Emacs 22.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Entering Special and Foreign Characters")
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-yank-function' is a function to use to yank
;;    text.  By default, it is `yank'.  Command
;;    `icicle-yank-maybe-completing' calls this function, except when
;;    it is called from the minibuffer or called with a negative
;;    prefix argument.  (`C-- C-y' lets you choose yanks (kills) to
;;    insert using completion.  It is a multi-command.  You can of
;;    course sort the candidates in various ways.)
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-use-candidates-only-once-flag'
;;    means that acting on a candidate removes it from the set of
;;    available candidates, so that you do not see that it can be used
;;    again.  (`TAB' or `S-TAB' makes it available again.)  The
;;    default value is `nil', and you probably do not want to
;;    customize this.  However, if you write Emacs-Lisp code that uses
;;    completion, then you can bind this to non-`nil' in contexts
;;    where that makes sense.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-deletion-action-flag' means
;;    `S-delete' during completion deletes the current object.  More
;;    precisely, it deletes the object named by the current completion
;;    candidate, if a deletion action is defined for the current
;;    command.  If no deletion action is defined, then the value of
;;    this option has no effect for that command.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-alternative-actions-alist' is an alist that
;;    associates Emacs commands and alternative action functions.  It
;;    overrides any alternative actions defined otherwise for the
;;    commands.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-type-actions-alist' is an alist that
;;    associates Emacs object types, such as buffer, file, and
;;    process, with functions that accept an object of the given type
;;    as their only required object.  This is used by some Emacs
;;    commands during completion to prompt for a function to apply to
;;    the current completion candidate.  Each function can be a symbol
;;    or a lambda expression.  At runtime, symbols that are not
;;    functions (`functionp') are ignored.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-type-actions-alist' is an alist of Emacs
;;    object types and associated actions (functions).  Each function
;;    must accept an object of the specified type as its only required
;;    argument.  A function here can be a symbol or a lambda
;;    expression.  Any symbols that do not have function definitions
;;    when this option is used are filtered out (not used).
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-use-anything-candidates-flag'
;;    means Anything actions are used for candidate alternative
;;    actions in some Icicles commands, and Anything types and actions
;;    are used by command `icicle-object-action' (aka `what-which-how'
;;    and `a').  The default value is `t'.  This option has no effect
;;    if library `anything.el' cannot be loaded.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option
;;    `icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag' means that Anything
;;    function `anything-transform-candidates' is applied to displayed
;;    Anything candidates in Icicles.
;;
;;    The advantage of a `nil' value is that command `icicle-anything'
;;    then acts as a multi-command: you can act on multiple
;;    candidates, or apply multiple actions for the same candidate,
;;    within a single invocation of `icicle-anything' (or related
;;    commands).  The advantage of a non-`nil' value is that some of
;;    the displayed Anything candidates might be more readable.  The
;;    default value is `nil'.  This option has no effect if library
;;    `anything.el' cannot be loaded.
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' controls how some
;;    completion candidates such as face, font, and color names are
;;    displayed as candidates in `*Completions*'.  If the value is
;;    non-`nil', then a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) sample
;;    is shown for the candidate.  For faces and colors, if the value
;;    is a string, then the name is accompanied by a separate swatch
;;    showing that string text.  If the value is `t', then the
;;    candidate name itself is shown using the face or color that it
;;    names.
;;
;;    You can use command `icicle-toggle-WYSIWYG-Completions', bound
;;    to `C-S-pause' during completion, to toggle this option, but the
;;    change takes effect only for the next act of completion; so, use
;;    `C-g' and repeat the current command to see the effect.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option
;;    `icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag' means that
;;    `completing-read' and (starting with Emacs 23) `read-file-name'
;;    will strip all text properties from the result they return.
;;    Regardless of the option value, Icicles strips text properties
;;    that it adds for its internal use.  See the doc string of
;;    function `icicle-unpropertize-completion' for more information
;;    about this.
;;
;;    The default value of the option is `nil'.  It is not likely that
;;    you will need to change this, but you might if you use some
;;    other library that cannot accept a propertized string as the
;;    result of completion.
;;
;;    Note: This is the case if you use GNUS - it has a known bug in
;;    this regard (reported 2008-06-21).  It blindly prints the
;;    Emacs-Lisp string that is the result of completion into an MML
;;    attribute value: filename=#("~/.gnus/attach.el" 0 25 (face
;;    nil)).  GNUS should ensure that whatever it uses for an
;;    attribute value is valid for MML (has normal "..." string
;;    syntax, with acceptable characters).  But it simply calls a Lisp
;;    print function, which prints #("...").
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-pp-eval-expression-print-length' and
;;    `icicle-pp-eval-expression-print-level' control the Lisp sexp
;;    print length and print level, respectively, for values printed
;;    by `M-:' (`icicle-pp-eval-expression').
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' means that all
;;    executable files (or all files, if option
;;    `shell-completion-execonly' is `nil') in your search path are
;;    included among the completion candidates whenever a shell
;;    command is read.  The particular non-`nil' value determines when
;;    this list of commands is updated from your current search path.
;;    The default value is `nil'.  (The computed commands are cached
;;    in `icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache'.)
;;    See (@> "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements").
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `icicle-quote-shell-file-name-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-read-shell-command-completing' double-quotes the file
;;    name at the beginning of the shell command it reads.  This
;;    affects several Emacs commands, such as `M-!' that read a shell
;;    command and its arguments.
;;
;;    If this is `nil', then such commands will not quote a
;;    shell-command file name such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe'.  In that case, a shell such
;;    as `bash' fails for a shell command such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &', because it
;;    interprets only `c:/Program' as the shell command.  That is, it
;;    interprets the space (`SPC') characters in the file name as
;;    separators.
;;
;;    If this is non-`nil' (the default value), then input such as
;;    `c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &' is passed to the
;;    shell as `"c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe" arg1 arg2 &'
;;    (notice the double-quotes).
;;
;;    See the doc string of `icicle-quote-file-name-part-of-cmd' for
;;    information about the characters that, like `SPC', lead to
;;    file-name quoting.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-inhibit-ding-flag' means Icicles
;;    never uses an audible bell (ding).
;;
;;  * Option `icicle-option-type-prefix-arg-list' is a list of symbols
;;    that control prefix arguments for command
;;    `icicle-describe-option-of-type' (bound to `C-h C-o' by
;;    default). A list of six symbols taken from this list:
;;
;;    `direct'            `inherit'            `inherit-or-value'
;;    `direct-or-value'   `inherit-or-regexp'  `direct-or-regexp'
;;
;;    Choose the order you like. The list members map, in order from
;;    left to right, to these prefix-argument keys:
;;
;;      1. `C-u C-u'
;;      2. `C-0'
;;      3. `C-u'
;;      4. `C-9' (positive)
;;      5. no prefix arg
;;      6. `C--' (negative)
;;
;;    For the meanings of the symbols, see the doc string of
;;    `icicle-describe-option-of-type', which describes the default
;;    prefix-argument bindings for the command.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option `icicle-customize-save-flag' means that
;;    Icicles will save the updated value of option
;;    `icicle-command-abbrev-alist' when you quit Emacs.  This is the
;;    normal behavior.  If you for some reason do not want your
;;    `custom-file' or init file (`~/.emacs') updated in this way,
;;    then customize `icicle-customize-save-flag' to `nil'.
;;
;;  * If user option `icicle-buffers-ido-like-flag' is `t' then
;;    `icicle-buffer' and similar commands act more Ido-like.
;;    Specifically, those commands then bind these options to `t':
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag',
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag', and
;;    `icicle-default-value'.
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-files-ido-like-flag' is `t' then `icicle-file'
;;    and similar commands act more Ido-like.  Specifically, those
;;    commands then bind these options to `t':
;;    `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag',
;;    `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag', and
;;    `icicle-default-value'.
;;
;;  * User options `icicle-cmpl-max-candidates-to-cycle' and
;;    `icicle-cmpl-include-cdabbrev-flag' control the behavior of
;;    Icicles command `icicle-complete', which replaces Emacs command
;;    `complete' from standard Emacs library `completion.el' when you
;;    are in Icicle mode.  The first of these options controls how
;;    many completion matches are required for Icicles completion to
;;    be used instead of in-place cycling replacement.  The second
;;    controls whether Icicles completion candidates can be found
;;    dynamically or should be limited to terms from your completions
;;    database.
;;
;;  * The value of option `icicle-customize-save-variable-function' is
;;    the function Icicles uses to automatically save user option
;;    changes made by some commands.  I recommend that you do *NOT*
;;    change this option value.  This is provided only for users who
;;    might want to disable such automatic saving of option changes,
;;    by setting this to `ignore', or users who might want to manage
;;    such option saving using their own function instead of the
;;    default value, `customize-save-variable'.
;;
;;  * (Emacs 23-25 only.) Non-`nil' option
;;    `icicle-read-char-by-name-multi-completion-flag' means that
;;    `icicle-read-char-by-name' (which, by the default value of
;;    option `icicle-functions-to-redefine', replaces vanilla
;;    `read-char-by-name' in Icicle mode) uses multi-completion and
;;    shows helpful information about the current completion candidate
;;    in the mode line (the character name and code point, in hex,
;;    octal, and decimal notation).
;;
;;    The 3-part multi-completion, NAME CODE CHAR, shows three ways to
;;    represent the character as text:
;;
;;    * NAME is the Unicode name
;;    * CODE is the Unicode code point, as a hexidecimal numeral
;;    * CHAR is the character (as it appears in text, not an integer)
;;
;;    Setting this option to `nil' can speed up reading a character
;;    considerably, but it does not give you the advantages of seeing
;;    the character (WYSIWYG) or matching its code point.
;;    
;;    Instead of using a `nil' value, you can also speed things up by:
;;
;;    * turning off incremental completion
;;    * choosing a strong input pattern, before asking for candidate
;;      matching
;;
;;  * (Emacs 23-25 only.) Option `icicle-zap-to-char-candidates'
;;    determines which character names are used for
;;    `icicle-zap-to-char' (bound to `M-z' by default) when
;;    completing.  The default value of `nil' means complete against
;;    character names that you have already entered.  You can instead
;;    set the value to `icicle-ucs-names' to complete against all
;;    Unicode character names.  Or you can set it to any function that
;;    returns a value of the same form at that returned by
;;    `icicle-ucs-names' (hence `ucs-names').
;;
;;  * The options whose names start with prefix `icicle-cand-preds-'
;;    are lists of predefined predicates that are used to filter
;;    completion candidates when you narrow with `M-&'.  Option
;;    `icicle-cand-preds-all' includes all such predicates, across all
;;    types of candidate.  The other options, named
;;    `icicle-cand-preds-for-TYPE', are each for a particular
;;    completion TYPE.  For example, `icicle-cand-preds-for-bookmark'
;;    provides predicates for narrowing bookmark candidates.  Option
;;    `icicle-cand-preds-for-misc', is an exception: its predicates
;;    apply to all candidate types.
;;
;;    These are the TYPE-specific options:
;;
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-bookmark'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-buffer'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-color'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-face'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-file'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-frame'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-package'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-symbol'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-variable'
;;      `icicle-cand-preds-for-window'
;;

;;
;;  File-Name and Directory-Name Completion Tips
;;  --------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section contains some tips about completing file and
;;  directory names.
;;
;;  See Also:
;;
;;  * (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere")
;;    for more information about this topic.
;;  * (@> "Customization and General Tips") for general tips about
;;    using Icicles.  Many of those tips apply also to file-name and
;;    directory-name completion.
;;
;;
;;  Tips:
;;
;;  * Functions `icicle-file-type-less-p', `icicle-dirs-first-p', and
;;    `icicle-dirs-last-p' are provided as possible values for user
;;    option `icicle-sort-comparer'.  When choosing a sort order using
;;    `C-,' or `M-,', these are called `by file type', `by directories
;;    first', and `by directories last'.  They sort directory names
;;    (alphabetically) before non-directory names (after, for
;;    `icicle-dirs-last-p').  Function `icicle-file-type-less-p' sorts
;;    non-directories by file type (extension) alphabetically.  For
;;    non-file-name input these all act like
;;    `icicle-case-string-less-p'.
;;
;;  * By default, files on MS Windows mapped network drives are
;;    treated by Icicles as remote files, because they can sometimes
;;    suffer from performance similar to remote files.  This
;;    assumption is controlled by user option
;;    `icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag': set it to `nil' if you
;;    want such files to be treated as local files.  You can toggle
;;    this option anytime during completion, using `C-x :'.
;;
;;    Other than this, there is no special treatment of MS Windows
;;    drive letters (e.g. `C:') - I use Cygwin on Windows.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' user option
;;    `icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag' hides the common
;;    match for your current input from each candidate in
;;    `*Completions*'.  You can toggle this at any time during
;;    completion using `C-x .' (`icicle-toggle-hiding-common-match').
;;    This can be especially useful when reading an absolute file name
;;    (e.g. `C-u C-x C-f'), by removing any common directory
;;    component.
;;
;;  * Standard Emacs user option `completion-ignored-extensions' is a
;;    list of file-name extensions.  File names that match any of
;;    these extensions are generally ignored for completion (but see
;;    the doc string for particulars).  In Icicles, however, the
;;    behavior is slightly different:
;;
;;    - In vanilla Emacs the option is itself ignored for display in
;;      buffer `*Completions*'.  That is, even file names that are
;;      ignored for completion are shown in `*Completions*' as
;;      available completion candidates.
;;
;;    - In Icicles this is not the case. When a file name is ignored
;;      it is ignored completely; it is not shown in `*Completions*'.
;;      But in Icicles you can toggle this ignoring off or on at any
;;      time during completion, using `C-.' in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    In addition, if you load library `completion-ignored-build.el',
;;    by Kevin Ryde, then Icicles automatically takes advantage of
;;    that library's dynamic adjustment of ignored extensions.  (Just
;;    load the library - do not enable its minor mode or advice.)
;;
;;  * User option `icicle-use-~-for-home-dir-flag' controls whether
;;    your home directory is written in the minibuffer using `~' or in
;;    expanded form, during completion.  The default value is `t',
;;    which means to use `~', saving minibuffer space.  You can toggle
;;    this option at any time using command
;;    `icicle-toggle-~-for-home-dir', bound to `M-~'.
;;
;;  * Remember that you can use a regular expression to
;;    apropos-complete file names.  This is a powerful feature.  Do
;;    not confuse its use with the ability to use shell wildcards
;;    (globbing) to access multiple files at once.  For example, if
;;    you use `C-x 4 f *.el RET', then all files with suffix `el' will
;;    be opened.  Regexp matching is used only for apropos (not
;;    prefix) completion and cycling.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Special Characters in Input Patterns").
;;
;;  * You can use `$' for both environment variables and as a regexp
;;    special character.  For example, you can use a pattern such as
;;    `$HOME.*t$' to match the files in your home directory (`$HOME')
;;    whose names end in `t'.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Special Characters in Input Patterns").
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23, you can complete environment variables
;;    during file-name completion, using `TAB'.  So you can, for
;;    example, complete `$HO' to any of the candidates `HOME',
;;    `HOMEDRIVE', `HOMEPATH'.  This is in addition to the expansion
;;    of complete environment variables (e.g. `$HOME' to
;;    `/my/home/dir/') when you use `S-TAB' or `RET'.
;;
;;  * You can use the idiom `\W$' as input to match only directories,
;;    when a command asks for a file or directory name.  The `\W' says
;;    to match any non word-syntax character.  The `$' says to match
;;    this at the end of the name.  This works because directory names
;;    appear as completion candidates with a trailing slash (`/'), and
;;    slash (`/') is about the only non word-syntax character that is
;;    likely to appear in file-name completions.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Special Characters in Input Patterns").
;;
;;  * You can use library `ffap.el' with Icicles, if you like, to pick
;;    up the file, directory, or URL name under the cursor.  All
;;    Icicles features are available during file-name and URL
;;    completion.  If you like `ffap.el', you might also like to try
;;    my extension library `ffap-.el'.  See also
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor").
;;
;;  * Many Icicles commands that target file or directory names look
;;    only in the current directory (`default-directory').  This means
;;    that the directory part of the name is ignored for matching
;;    purposes.  You can thus use apropos completion to match a
;;    substring, without needing to prefix the substring with `.*'.
;;    For example, to match file `favorite-foo-file.bar' in directory
;;    `/some/path/to/my/', it is sufficient to use either `foo' or
;;    `/some/path/to/my/foo'.
;;
;;  * Some Icicles commands that target file names match your input
;;    against file names as ordinary strings, that is, with no notion
;;    that they are actually file names.  This is the case for
;;    `icicle-locate-file', `icicle-recent-file',
;;    `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table', and
;;    `icicle-find-file-absolute', as well as `icicle-file' with a
;;    prefix argument.  Such candidates are often absolute file names.
;;    In that case, you can regexp-match against any part of the
;;    absolute file name, including directory components.  See
;;    (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Find Files Anywhere, Without Knowing Where").
;;
;;  * If you have symbolic links that might get in the way of
;;    exploring directories while locating files, you can use command
;;    `icicle-locate-file-no-symlinks' instead of `icicle-locate-file'
;;    - it will not follow symbolic links.
;;
;;    This also gives you a way to temporarily avoid descending into a
;;    subdirectory you are not interested in: put a symbolic link in
;;    its place temporarily.
;;
;;    Another, cleaner way to skip certain directories is to customize
;;    or `let'-bind option `icicle-ignored-directories'. By default
;;    this is the value of `vc-directory-exclusion-list', which means
;;    that it ignores version-control directories.
;;
;;  * For Emacs 23 and later, if you use commands such as
;;    `icicle-file' and `icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content', which
;;    let you match a file name and/or file content, remember that it
;;    is far quicker to match a name than it is to search content.
;;    The more you match names to narrow the set of files whose
;;    contents need to be searched, the quicker matching will be.
;;    Remember too that option `icicle-kill-visited-buffers-flag'
;;    controls whether to keep or kill any file buffers that were
;;    searched but whose files did not ultimately choose.  Keeping
;;    them is essentially caching them.
;;
;;  * You can use `..' or `C-backspace' during file-name completion to
;;    access a parent directory.  You can use `/' and `~/' to shadow
;;    any input to the left of these patterns.
;;
;;  * You can move up and down the file hierarchy as usual, by editing
;;    the directory portion of your input or by using shortcuts like
;;    `C-backspace' (see previous).  You can move down the hierarchy
;;    by doing either of the following when the current completion
;;    candidate is a directory:
;;
;;    - `C-M-/'
;;    - `C-e' followed by `TAB' or `S-TAB'
;;
;;  * If option `icicle-find-file-expand-directory-flag' is non-`nil'
;;    then just choosing a directory-name candidate using `RET' or
;;    `mouse-2' cycles into it.  `RET' thus acts like `C-M-/' instead
;;    of opening the candidate directory in Dired.  (Multi-command
;;    candidate-action keys such as `C-RET' continue to open the
;;    candidate directory in Dired.)  You can toggle this option using
;;    `C-x /'.
 
;;(@* "Key Bindings")
;;
;;  Key Bindings
;;  ------------
;;
;;  You can easily customize any of the key bindings that Icicles uses
;;  - see (@> "Customizing Key Bindings").  I recommend that you first
;;  try using the default bindings, however.  There are many Icicles
;;  key bindings (in particular in the minibuffer), but they are
;;  grouped into a few natural sets, to help you remember them.  And
;;  there are user options available for easy key customization.
;;
;;(@* "Global Bindings")
;;  ** Global Bindings **
;;
;;  Icicles does not change your global key bindings.  It changes some
;;  minibuffer bindings, and it adds minor-mode bindings for Icicle
;;  mode, but it does not change your global bindings.
;;
;;  There are two exceptions:
;;
;;  1. In Icicle mode, various Icicles commands are added to menu-bar
;;  menus.  File commands are added to the File menu, and so on, under
;;  an Icicles submenu.  Those items that do not belong naturally to
;;  any existing menu-bar menu are added to a new top-level Icicles
;;  menu and to the existing Minibuf menu.  Whatever the menu they
;;  appear in, however, Icicles menu items are visible only when
;;  Icicle mode is active.
;;
;;  If you do not want Icicles to add items to menus besides Minibuf
;;  and Icicles, then set option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus' to
;;  non-`nil'.  See (@> "Customizing Key Bindings").
;;
;;  2. Icicles adds the key `S-TAB' (bound to `icicle-complete-keys')
;;  to each existing keymap.  This allows you to complete keys in any
;;  keymap.  For technical reasons, these bindings are not part of
;;  `icicle-mode-map'; other keymaps are enhanced to include this
;;  binding.  However, this Icicles binding of `S-TAB' never replaces
;;  any existing binding of `S-TAB'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Key Completion") for more
;;  information about this use of `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  (The documentation always refers to the key that performs key
;;  completion as `S-TAB'.  Actually, it is `S-TAB' only by default.
;;  You can customize it, using option `icicle-key-complete-keys'.)
;;
;;(@* "Icicle-Mode Bindings")
;;  ** Icicle-Mode Bindings **
;;
;;  Most top-level Icicle-mode bindings are in the Icicles menu-bar
;;  menu.  In addition, option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' causes
;;  Icicles to bind some keyboard keys to some top-level Icicles
;;  commands.  Some of these take the place of similar, global
;;  bindings whenever you are in Icicle mode.  Typically, these
;;  top-level commands are Icicles multi-command versions of vanilla
;;  Emacs commands.  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands").
;;
;;  You can customize option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' to
;;  specify the top-level commands that you want to bind in Icicle
;;  mode, and the keys you want to bind them to.  With the default
;;  value of `icicle-top-level-key-bindings', Icicles makes the
;;  following Icicle-mode bindings:
;;
;;  * `C-c ''          - `icicle-occur'
;;  * `C-c ='          - `icicle-imenu'
;;  * `C-c ^'          - `icicle-search-keywords'
;;  * `C-c "'          - `icicle-search-text-property'
;;  * `C-c $'          - `icicle-search-word'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-search'
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-compilation-search' (in *grep* etc.)
;;  * `C-c `'          - `icicle-comint-search' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c TAB'        - `icicle-comint-command' (in *shell* etc.)
;;  * `C-c /'          - `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry'

;;  `S-TAB' is bound, in effect, to `icicle-complete-keys', which

;;
;;  Actually, by default, Icicles binds `icicle-yank-maybe-completing'
;;  to whatever the value of option `icicle-yank-function' is.  By
;;  default, this value is `yank'.
;;
;;  The substitution of `icicle-dired(-other-window)' for
;;  `dired(-other-window)' happens by default only if you do not use
;;  library `Dired+'.  If you do use `Dired+' then the commands are
;;  already Icicles multi-commands, and are especially powerful.
;;
;;  Option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' remaps not only these
;;  standard Emacs commands but also some commands provided by other
;;  libraries.  For example, if you use package `Bookmark+', then
;;  type-specific bookmark jump commands such as
;;  `bmkp-dired-jump-other-window' are remapped to Icicles
;;  multi-command versions.
;;
;;  In addition, option `icicle-functions-to-redefine' redefines some
;;  vanilla functions to their Icicles versions while in Icicle mode.
;;  Any redefined functions that are bound to keys keep those
;;  bindings.  For example, `Info-index' is by default redefined to
;;  `icicle-Info-index' in Icicle mode, so `i' in Info mode is
;;  effectively bound to `icicle-Info-index'.  Commands listed in
;;  option `icicle-functions-to-redefine' are typically, but not
;;  always, bound in keymaps other than the global map.
;;
;;  There are many Icicles commands that are not bound to any keys by
;;  default.  You might want to bind some of them to keys in keymap
;;  `icicle-mode-map', i.e., in Icicle mode.  For a list of top-level
;;  Icicles commands, see the Commentary headers of files
;;  `icicles-cmd1.el' and `icicles-cmd2.el'.
;;
;;(@* "Minibuffer Bindings")
;;  ** Minibuffer Bindings **
;;
;;  There are many key bindings available while your input is read in
;;  the minibuffer, for example, while you are editing it.  Some of
;;  these keys are available regardless of whether completion is
;;  available for your input.
;;
;;  Others are available only during completion.  Most of those keys
;;  are bound in the minibuffer completion keymaps, but some are bound
;;  in the `*Completions*' buffer keymap.
;;
;;  In addition, clicking `C-mouse-3' on a completion candidate in
;;  buffer `*Completions*' pops up a menu of available commands.  Some
;;  of these menu commands are applicable to the completion you click;
;;  others apply to the current state of completion or to the complete
;;  set of completion candidates.  The associated key bindings are
;;  indicated in the menu items, so this can be a good way to learn
;;  minibuffer and `*Completions*' bindings.
;;
;;  You can easily customize the Icicles minibuffer and
;;  `*Completions*' buffer key bindings.  There are several user
;;  options available for this.  This section describes the keys that
;;  are bound by default.  Section (@> "Customizing Key Bindings")
;;  describes the options available for customizing them.  The keys
;;  described in this section are those bound by default.
;;
;;  The following key is helpful during any minibuffer input.  It pops
;;  up the `*Help*' buffer with information about using the minibuffer
;;  in Icicle mode.  During completion, this includes information
;;  similar to what you are reading now.  It also lists toggle
;;  commands and the current toggle values.
;;
;;    `M-?' - `icicle-minibuffer-help'
;;
;;  The following key will always cancel all minibuffer input.  No
;;  matter whether you have recursive minibuffers, it always returns
;;  you directly to the Emacs top level ("without passing GO"), but it
;;  first allows Icicles multi-commands to perform any necessary
;;  cleanup.
;;
;;    `C-M-T' (aka `C-M-S-t') - `icicle-top-level'
;;
;;  The following key performs Icicles key completion in the
;;  minibuffer.
;;
;;    `M-S-TAB' - `icicle-complete-keys'
;;
;;  You can also use this to see all of the keys that are currently
;;  available in the minibuffer, whether or not completion is
;;  available, and regardless of completion candidate type.  `M-S-TAB'
;;  does this by default, but you can change this by customizing
;;  option `icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer'.
;;
;;  The following key bindings are made for the minibuffer completion
;;  keymaps.  They are in effect whenever you are using the minibuffer
;;  for input with completion (e.g. `completing-read',
;;  `read-file-name', `M-x').
;;
;;  The keys mentioned are those that are bound by default and used in
;;  the documentation, but you can customize any or all of them using
;;  option `icicle-completion-key-bindings'.
;;
;;    `down', `wheel-down' - `icicle-next-candidate-per-mode' (modal)
;;    `up', `wheel-up' - `icicle-previous-candidate-per-mode' (modal)
;;
;;    `next', `prior'  - `icicle-next-apropos-candidate',
;;                       `icicle-previous-apropos-candidate', which
;;                       cycle candidate apropos completions.
;;
;;    `end', `home'    - `icicle-next-prefix-candidate',
;;                       `icicle-previous-prefix-candidate',
;;                       which cycle candidate prefix completions.
;;
;;      Whether a modal cycling key is used for prefix or apropos
;;      completion at a given time depends on the current completion
;;      mode, which is determined by which of `TAB' and `S-TAB' was
;;      used last, or by option `icicle-default-cycling-mode' if
;;      neither was used.
;;
;;      (The mouse wheel bindings are only for Emacs 22 and later.
;;      The documentation refers to the keys that cycle completion
;;      candidates as `down', `up', `next', `prior', `end', and
;;      `home'.  Actually, these are the cycling keys only by default.
;;      You can customize them using options
;;      `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys', `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys',
;;      `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys',
;;      `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys',
;;      `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys', and
;;      `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'.)
;;
;;    Keys bound globally to commands that perform simple text
;;    insertion, deletion, and transposition operations - commands
;;    such as `self-insert-command' - are bound to Icicles versions of
;;    those commands that do the same thing but also provide apropos
;;    icompletion.  This includes keys such as `C-d', `C-k', and `C-w'
;;    (and lots more).  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icompletion").
;;
;;    `pause'  - `icicle-switch-to/from-minibuffer': Move cursor to

;;
;;    `M-SPC'  - `icicle-prefix-word-complete': Complete current input
;;               in minibuffer, as a prefix, a single word at a time.
;;               This replaces `minibuffer-complete-word'.  In fact,
;;               it is the keys in `icicle-word-completion-keys' that
;;               are bound to this command; `M-SPC' is only the
;;               default key binding.
;;
;;    `S-SPC'  - `icicle-apropos-complete-and-narrow': Same as

;;
;;    `S-backspace' - `icicle-apropos-complete-and-widen': Same as

;;
;;    `TAB' -    `icicle-prefix-complete': Complete current input in

;;               prefix-completion candidate, display them in buffer
;;               `*Completions*', highlighting the common prefix.

;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the key that does

;;
;;               (The documentation always refers to the keys that do
;;               these things as `S-TAB'.  Actually, they are only

;;    `S-mouse-2' - `icicle-mouse-remove-candidate': Same as `delete'.
;;
;;    `M-o'    - `icicle-insert-history-element': Invoke completion to

;;
;;               During Isearch, `M-o' completes against the current

;;
;;    `M-q'    - `icicle-insert-key-description': Insert the textual

;;
;;    `M-r'    - `icicle-roundup': Insert one or more completion

;;
;;    `M-R'    - `icicle-multi-inputs-act': Act on multi-inputs.
;;               Parse minibuffer input into a list of candidates,
;;               then act on each candidate, in order.
;;
;;    `M-S'    - `icicle-multi-inputs-save': Add multi-inputs to the

;;
;;  By default, `TAB' and `S-TAB' also perform modal candidate cycling

;;
;;  In Icicles, multi-line completion candidates are not uncommon.
;;  You can move up and down minibuffer lines with `C-p' and `C-n',

;;  and ends:
;;
;;    `C-a', `C-e' - `icicle-beginning-of-line+',
;;               `icicle-end-of-line+': Like normal `C-a', `C-e', but
;;               repeating goes to the previous or next line.
;;
;;  If you use libraries `fit-frame.el' and `oneonone.el' with a
;;  standalone minibuffer frame (non-`nil'
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag'), and if option
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-`nil', then the minibuffer
;;  frame is automatically resized to fit its content as you edit that
;;  content.  (Options `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height' and
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height-percent' define the maximum
;;  height for this.)
;;
;;  If, in addition, you bind `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame' to a key,
;;  then you can use that key repeatedly to increase the height by one
;;  line, even beyond the maximum.  Library `setup-keys.el' binds this
;;  to `C-o'.
;;
;;  (If you do not use a separate minibuffer frame, then you will
;;  likely want to set standard option `resize-mini-windows' to `t',
;;  not to `grow-only', at least while in Icicle mode.)

;;  You can insert a single Icicles multi-line dot using `C-u .', or
;;  by turning on this dot magic generally, using `C-M-.':
;;
;;    `.'     - `icicle-insert-dot-command'
;;    `C-M-.' - `icicle-toggle-dot'
;;
;;  In vanilla Emacs, the following keys have a special purpose during
;;  input completion, but in Icicles they simply insert the character
;;  typed - they are self-inserting.  This is because (1) there are
;;  better ways to do what vanilla Emacs uses these keys for and (2)
;;  it is useful to be able to insert these characters without first
;;  typing `C-q' to quote them.
;;
;;    `?'   - see also
;;            (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Special Characters in Input Patterns")
;;
;;    `SPC' (space)
;;
;;    `C-j' (newline) - see also `C-o', above, and
;;                      (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Completions")
;;
;;  The only exception to this rule is that for `M-x'
;;  (`icicle-execute-extended-command') with prefix completion, `SPC'
;;  does the same thing as for vanilla Emacs: it completes the command
;;  name a word at a time.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings are made to clear minibuffer
;;  input, making them handy for editing and removing completions
;;  (e.g. default or initial values) in the minibuffer.
;;
;;    `M-k' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer-or-history-element'
;;    `M-S-backspace', `M-S-delete' - `icicle-erase-minibuffer'
;;
;;  `M-k' has an alternative behavior when you are cycling minibuffer
;;  history items: it deletes the current item from the history.
;;
;;  The following key is bound during completion to control the
;;  display of thumbnail images in `*Completions*' for candidates that
;;  name image files or image-file bookmarks (see Bookmark+).  It
;;  cycles the value of option `icicle-image-files-in-Completions' to
;;  show images and names (the default), show only names, or show only
;;  images.
;;
;;    `C-x t'         - `icicle-cycle-image-file-thumbnail'
;;
;;  During (absolute or relative) file-name completion, the following
;;  minibuffer bindings are also in effect:
;;
;;    `C-backspace'   - `icicle-up-directory':
;;                      Navigate up the directory hierarchy.
;;    `C-c +'         - `icicle-make-directory': Create a directory.
;;    `C-x m'         - `icicle-bookmark-file-other-window':
;;                      Visit a file or directory (Dired) bookmark.
;;                      See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Accessing Saved Locations (Bookmarks) on the Fly").
;;                      (Available only if you use `bookmark+.el'.)
;;
;;  During some absolute file-name completion, you can use `C-c C-d'
;;  to change the current directory on the fly (think UNIX command
;;  `cd').  See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Absolute File Names and Different Directories").
;;
;;  During buffer-name completion, additional minibuffer bindings are
;;  defined by user option `icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings'.  By
;;  default, they are the following:
;;
;;    `C-x F'         - Toggle whether to include cached files (i.e.,
;;                      toggle option
;;                      `icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag')
;;
;;    `C-x R'         - Toggle whether to include recent files (i.e.,
;;                      toggle option
;;                      `icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag')
;;
;;    `C-x m'         - `icicle-bookmark-non-file-other-window':
;;                      Visit a buffer (non-file) bookmark.  See also
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Accessing Saved Locations (Bookmarks) on the Fly").
;;                      (Available only if you use `bookmark+.el'.)
;;
;;    `C-x C-m -'     - `icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode':
;;                      Remove buffer-name candidates with a major
;;                      mode that is derived from a given mode.
;;                      Repeat to filter progressively.
;;                      (`C-m' is the same key as `RET'.)
;;
;;    `C-x C-m +'  - `icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode':
;;                      Keep only buffer-name candidates with a major
;;                      mode that is derived from a given mode.
;;
;;    `C-x M -'       - `icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-mode': Same as
;;                      `C-x C-m -', but excludes ancestor modes.
;;
;;    `C-x M +'       - `icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-mode': Same
;;                      as `C-x C-m +', but excludes ancestor modes.
;;
;;    `C-x * -'       - `icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-modified':
;;                      Remove modified buffers.
;;
;;    `C-x * +'       - `icicle-keep-buffer-cands-for-modified': Keep
;;                      only modified buffers.
;;
;;    `C-x i -'       - `icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-indirect':
;;                      Remove indirect buffers.
;;
;;    `C-x i +'       - `icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-indirect':
;;                      Keep only indirect buffers.
;;
;;    `C-x v -'       - `icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-visible':
;;                      Remove buffers that are visible.  Includes
;;                      buffers in iconified frames.
;;
;;    `C-x v +'       - `icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-visible':

;;                      buffers in iconified frames.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer binding during completion refreshes the
;;  `*Completions*' display.
;;
;;    `C-x C-M-l'     - `icicle-display-candidates-in-Completions'
;;
;;  You will likely never need to use it for that purpose.  However,
;;  in Info mode, during command `icicle-Info-index' (bound to `i' in
;;  Info), the same key, `C-x C-M-l', searches for all nodes that
;;  correspond to the current completion candidates, and highlights
;;  those that you have already visited, using face
;;  `icicle-historical-candidate-other' (which by default looks like a
;;  link).
;;
;;  The following minibuffer binding moves the cursor to the start of
;;  the part of your input, if any, that is highlighted because it
;;  does not match any completion candidate (see option
;;  `icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure').  Repeating this
;;  command kills the rest of the line, removing the highlighted
;;  mismatched input.
;;
;;    `C-M-l'         - `icicle-goto/kill-failed-input'
;;
;;  The remaining input matches at least one candidate.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings can be used to get rid of a
;;  completion inserted during cycling, and retrieve what you last
;;  typed during completion or any previous completion inputs:
;;
;;    `C-l'           - `icicle-retrieve-previous-input'
;;    `C-S-l' (`C-L') - `icicle-retrieve-next-input'
;;
;;  You can use these to cycle among and reuse inputs that you typed
;;  during completion but did not enter.  This completion input is not
;;  recorded in the standard input histories - they record only input
;;  that you have entered with `RET'.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;  For example, suppose that you used `C-h v hook' to examine various
;;  hook variables, and you did this using`C-next' to display their
;;  documentation.  If you finished the command by just typing `C-g',
;;  then your input (`hook') was never really entered, so it is not
;;  available via the minibuffer history (`M-p').  You can retrieve it
;;  with `C-l', to use it again, in your next command.  User option
;;  `icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag' controls the behavior of `C-l'
;;  and `C-L'; if non-`nil', then, instead of cycling inputs, these
;;  commands let you access previous inputs using completion.
;;
;;  You can insert minibuffer history items using the cycle keys `M-p'
;;  and `M-n', as usual.  But in Icicle mode, `M-s' and `M-r' are not
;;  available.  Instead, use `M-o' to insert any history item using
;;  completion (including regexp completion, of course).
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings also let you use apropos
;;  completion on the current minibuffer history list.  For
;;  explanation, see (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "History Enhancements").
;;
;;    `M-h'     - `icicle-history'
;;    `M-pause' - `icicle-keep-only-past-inputs'
;;
;;  Minibuffer binding `C-M-pause' lets you use a different minibuffer
;;  history during the current input reading with completion.
;;  Normally, you are prompted for the history to use.  Starting with
;;  Emacs 23, if option `icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag' is
;;  non-`nil', then during command, abbrev, and keyboard-macro
;;  completion, `C-M-pause' completes your input against the history
;;  of all commands that were invoked interactively in any way,
;;  `icicle-interactive-history'.
;;
;;  The following minibuffer bindings let you act on candidate
;;  completions.  For explanation, see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands"),
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "More about Multi-Commands"),

;;
;;    `M-:'     - `icicle-pp-eval-expression-in-minibuffer'
;;
;;  Some additional bindings are made available in the minibuffer for
;;  the duration of specific commands:
;;
;;  * During completion of names of some kinds of objects (files,
;;    buffers, directories, Info nodes), `C-x m' lets you complete
;;    against bookmarks that have the same type as those objects (file
;;    bookmarks, buffer bookmarks, Dired bookmarks, Info bookmarks).
;;    This feature requires use of package `Bookmark+'.
;;
;;  * During completion of file names, `C-backspace' is bound to
;;    `icicle-up-directory', which navigates to the parent directory
;;    and completes there instead.
;;
;;  * During completion of bookmark names, various keys with the
;;    prefix `C-M-' are bound to commands that narrow the available
;;    candidates to bookmarks of a specific type.  For example,
;;    `C-M-d' narrows the choices to Dired bookmarks.
;;    (You can also narrow bookmark choices by type using `M-&'.
;;    See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "`M-&': Satisfying Additional Predicates").)

;;  Customizing Key Bindings
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  See (@> "Key Bindings") for a description of the default key
;;  bindings defined by Icicles.  The options mentioned here are also
;;  presented there, in context.  You can customize all of the
;;  key-binding user options (there are over 50 of them!) using this
;;  command:
;;
;;    M-x customize-group RET Icicles-Key-Bindings
;;
;;  Key bindings are very personal choices, and reflect preferences
;;  and habits, as well as keyboard and other configurations.  You
;;  might want to change some of the bindings that Icicles creates.
;;  This section tells you how to do that.
;;
;;  However, before doing so, unless the default bindings present a
;;  hardware or OS configuration problem for you, please try using the
;;  default bindings for a while, before deciding that you want to
;;  change them.  Habit is a powerful persuader, but its advice is not
;;  always the best ;-).
;;
;;  These are the main kinds of Icicles key bindings.  They are
;;  described in the sections below.
;;
;;  * Global bindings
;;    . Additions to menu-bar menus
;;    . Key completion keys (`S-TAB' by default)
;;  * Icicle mode bindings
;;  * Minibuffer bindings
;;  * `*Completions*' buffer bindings
;;
;;  The Icicles user options for binding keys take two forms.  In most
;;  cases, the option name ends with `-keys', and the option value is
;;  simply a list of keys that act the same.
;;
;;  In the following cases, however, the option name ends with
;;  `-key-bindings' and the option value is a list of possibly
;;  conditional key bindings.
;;
;;  * `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' - top-level key bindings.
;;
;;  * `icicle-minibuffer-key-bindings' - minibuffer key bindings
;;    defined regardless of whether completion is available.  This
;;    does not include keys concerned with completion, cycling, and
;;    help, which are covered by other options (below).
;;
;;  * `icicle-completion-key-bindings' - minibuffer key bindings
;;    available during completion.
;;
;;  * `icicle-completion-list-key-bindings' - key bindings for buffer
;;    `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  Each of these `*-key-bindings' options has the same form, a list
;;  of elements which each have the form (KEY COMMAND CONDITION).  KEY
;;  is either a key sequence (string or vector) to bind COMMAND to or
;;  a command to remap to COMMAND.  COMMAND is bound according to the
;;  value of KEY, unless the result of evaluating CONDITION is `nil'.
;;
;;  The following options, with names ending in `-keys', cover keys
;;  available during completion and which provide completion, cycling,
;;  or help.
;;
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys'            (`down', `wheel-down')
;;    Cycle to the next candidate (modal).
;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'                  (`up', `wheel-up')
;;    Cycle to the previous candidate (modal).
;;  * `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-keys'                        (`next')
;;    Cycle to the next apropos-completion candidate.
;;  * `icicle-apropos-cycle-previous-keys'                   (`prior')
;;    Cycle to the previous apropos-completion candidate.
;;  * `icicle-prefix-cycle-next-keys'                          (`end')
;;    Cycle to the next prefix-completion candidate.
;;  * `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys'                     (`home')
;;    Cycle to the previous prefix-completion candidate.

;;  * `icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys'               (`C-S-up')
;;    Cycle to previous candidate and alternative-act on it (modal).
;;  * `icicle-apropos-cycle-next-alt-action-keys'         (`C-S-next')

;;    Cycle to next prefix-completion candidate and show help for it.
;;  * `icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-help-keys'            (`C-M-home')
;;    Cycle to previous prefix-completion candidate and show help.
;;  * `icicle-prefix-complete-keys'                            (`TAB')
;;    Prefix-complete your input.
;;  * `icicle-apropos-complete-keys'                         (`S-TAB')
;;    Apropos-complete your input.
;;  * `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys'             (`C-M-TAB')
;;    Prefix-complete without showing `*Completions*'.
;;  * `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys'          (`C-M-S-TAB')
;;    Apropos-complete without showing `*Completions*'.
;;  * `icicle-word-completion-keys'                          (`M-SPC')
;;    Prefix-complete your input a word at a time.
;;
;;  Options `icicle-apropos-complete-keys' and
;;  `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys' go together, as do
;;  options `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' and
;;  `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys'.  The first perform
;;  apropos completion; the second perform prefix completion.
;;
;;  By default, Icicles reflects vanilla Emacs by associating `TAB'
;;  with prefix completion.  But you might prefer to associate it with
;;  apropos completion.  Or you might want to switch back and forth.
;;
;;  Besides customizing those completion-mode key options
;;  individually, you can easily swap the keys that for apropos
;;  completion with those for prefix completion, at any time.  For
;;  that, use command `icicle-toggle-completion-mode-keys', which is
;;  bound to `M-i TAB' during completion.  When it switches away from
;;  whatever persistent values you have for these options, it asks you
;;  whether you want to save the new values.  This command also
;;  toggles the value of option `icicle-default-cycling-mode'.
;;
;;  The following options, with names ending in `-keys', cover
;;  miscellaneous actions that make use of the minibuffer in some way.
;;
;;  * `icicle-key-complete-keys'                             (`S-TAB')
;;    Complete key sequences.
;;  * `icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer'            (`M-S-TAB')
;;    Complete key sequences in the minibuffer.
;;  * `icicle-completing-read+insert-keys'                 (`C-M-S-c')
;;    Completion on demand.
;;  * `icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys'                  (`C-M-S-f')
;;    Completion on demand for file names.
;;  * `icicle-search-from-isearch-keys'                      (`S-TAB')
;;    Start `icicle-search' from Isearch.
;;  * `icicle-isearch-complete-keys'              (`M-TAB', `C-M-TAB')
;;    Complete Isearch string using search ring.
;;  * `icicle-isearch-history-insert-keys'                     (`M-o')
;;    Append past Isearch strings, using completion with search ring.
;;
;;  Whenever you customize an Icicles key binding, whether via a user
;;  option value or using `define-key' or `global-set-key', you can
;;  use function `icicle-kbd' to express the key sequence in a
;;  user-friendly way.
;;
;;  It is the same as vanilla Emacs `kbd', except that (by default) it
;;  does not require you to use angle brackets (`<', `>') around
;;  function keys (and it does not expect you to).
;;
;;  So you can write, e.g., (icicle-kbd "C-delete") instead of one of
;;  these: (kbd "C-<delete>"), [C-delete], or [(control delete)].
;;  There are plenty of examples of the use of `icicle-kbd' in the
;;  Icicles source files.
;;
;;  In addition to the options listed above, whose values are keys or
;;  lists of keys, option `icicle-TAB/S-TAB-only-completes-flag'
;;  controls whether repeating `TAB' or `S-TAB' causes (modal)
;;  candidate cycling.  The default value of `nil' means that it does.
;;  If you prefer that these keys (actually the keys that are the
;;  values of options `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' and
;;  `icicle-apropos-complete-keys') perform only completion and you
;;  use other keys for cycling, then set the value to non-`nil'.
;;
;;(@* "Customizing Global Bindings")
;;  ** Customizing Global Bindings **
;;
;;  Icicles normally adds items to appropriate existing menu-bar
;;  menus, such as File and Options, as well as to menu-bar menus
;;  Minibuf and Icicles.  These items are placed in an Icicles submenu
;;  (e.g. Files > Icicles).  If you do not want to add an Icicles
;;  submenu, then set option `icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag' to
;;  non-`nil' before loading Icicles.  The menu items are then added
;;  to the Icicles menu.
;;
;;  Icicles binds key completion (`icicle-complete-keys') to the keys
;;  defined in option `icicle-key-complete-keys'.  See
;;  (@> "Key Bindings") for more information about this.
;;
;;(@* "Customizing Icicle Mode Bindings")
;;  ** Customizing Icicle Mode Bindings **
;;
;;  In the Icicle mode keymap, several top-level commands are bound by
;;  default.  You can use option `icicle-top-level-key-bindings' to
;;  customize the keys that are used for these commands, or to remove
;;  any such bindings.
;;
;;(@* "Customizing Minibuffer Bindings")
;;  ** Customizing Minibuffer Bindings **
;;
;;  There are user options for most Icicles minibuffer bindings that
;;  you might want to change - see above for the list.  This section
;;  tells you how to change additional bindings.
;;
;;  To understand how you can modify Icicles minibuffer bindings, it
;;  helps to know how Icicles creates the default bindings.  For that,
;;  the best advice is to consult the Emacs-Lisp code in library
;;  `icicle-mode.el'.  Even if you are not very familiar with
;;  Emacs-Lisp, however, you should be able to do what you want by
;;  adapting the example in this section.
;;
;;  Suppose that you want to bind `f8' and `f9' to traverse the input
;;  history up and down whenever you are in Icicle mode.  There are no
;;  user options for this, but you can do it by inserting this code
;;  into your init file (~/.emacs), before the code that requires
;;  (loads) library `icicles.el':
;;
;;  (add-hook 'icicle-mode-hook 'bind-my-icicles-keys)
;;  (defun bind-my-icicles-keys ()
;;    "Replace some default Icicles minibuffer bindings with others."

;;    `bbdb-complete-mail' (from BBDB 3.0.2 or 3.1),
;;    `bbdb-complete-name' (from BBDB 2.35),

;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  You can report a problem you experience with Icicles on the Emacs
;;  Wiki, here: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IciclesIssuesOpen.
;;
;;  But the best way to report an Icicles issue or pass along a
;;  suggestion is by email.  Do one of the following:
;;
;;  * Choose item `Send Bug Report' from menu-bar menu `Icicles'.
;;
;;  * Use `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'.
;;
;;  * Use `M-?' from the minibuffer.  Then click button `Icicles
;;    Options and Faces' in buffer `*Help*'.  Then click the link
;;    `Send Bug Report' in buffer `*Customize Group: icicles*'.
;;
;;  When you report a problem, please always mention your Emacs
;;  version and platform (e.g. Windows, GNU/Linux).  If you are not
;;  using the latest Icicles files, mention which ones you are using.
;;  Icicles files each have an `Update #' field in the header, which
;;  identifies the file exactly.
;;
;;  If you can include a debugger backtrace in your email, that helps
;;  - see the next section.
;;
;;(@* "Debugging Tips")
;;  ** Debugging Tips **
;;
;;  1. If you use the debugger to report a backtrace, first delete (or
;;     move out of your `load-path') all Icicles byte-compiled files,
;;     so that you use only the source files (`icicles*.el') for
;;     debugging.
;;
;;  2. Set `debug-on-error' to `t', so that if an error is raised you
;;     get a debugger backtrace.
;;
;;  3. If you want to enter the debugger at a particular point and
;;     step through the execution, you can either use `M-x
;;     debug-on-entry' (to enter the debugger whenever you enter a
;;     given function) or temporarily place breakpoint calls to the
;;     debugger - `(debug)' - in the source code and reevaluate the
;;     enclosing function definition.
;;
;;  4. When in the debugger, use `d' to step through the execution or
;;     `c' to skip over a particular step (execute it to completion,
;;     skipping over the details).  Use `q' to exit the debugger.  An
;;     alternative to using the regular debugger is to use `edebug' -
;;     some people prefer that.
;;
;;  Remember to load only the source files - a backtrace from
;;  byte-compiled code is not very useful.  Include the backtrace in
;;  your bug report.
 
;;(@* "Programming with Fancy Candidates")
;;
;;  Programming with Fancy Candidates
;;  ---------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Icicles lets you program with several kinds of candidates that are
;;  not supported by vanilla Emacs.  For lack of a better word, I call
;;  them all "fancy candidates".  Multi-completions are fancy
;;  candidates.  So are ordinary string candidates that have text
;;  properties such as `face'.  And there are other kinds of fancy
;;  candidates.
;;
;;  Because they are not supported by vanilla Emacs, and because
;;  Icicles uses Emacs functions such as `all-completions' to perform
;;  the primitive completion operations, fancy candidates require some
;;  extra processing.
;;
;;  All fancy candidates must first be converted to a form that such
;;  primitives can understand.  During completion, fancy candidates
;;  must sometimes be displayed specially, for example using
;;  particular faces.  And after completion, the completion result
;;  must sometimes be converted back again to retrieve some or all of
;;  the original candidate information.
;;
;;  This conversion (encoding and decoding) can be costly, especially
;;  when there are many candidates.  For this reason, it is turned
;;  off, by default, so it that does not represent overhead during
;;  completion of non-fancy candidates.
;;
;;  In order to use `completing-read' with fancy candidates, you must
;;  do one of the following in your code:
;;
;;  1. Propertize at least the first character of the
;;     `completing-read' PROMPT argument string with a non-`nil' text
;;     property `icicle-fancy-candidates'.  This turns on processing
;;     of fancy candidates for the duration of the `completing-read'
;;     call.
;;
;;  2. Bind variable `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' to non-`nil'.
;;
;;  3. Bind variable `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to
;;     non-`nil'.
;;
;;  You use method 1 or 2 to handle multi-completion candidates or
;;  candidates that have text properties or are otherwise to be
;;  displayed specially.  I recommend that you generally use text
;;  property `icicle-fancy-candidates', not variable
;;  `icicle-fancy-candidates-p'.  The variable is provided so that you
;;  can widen the scope of this feature beyond a given call to
;;  `completing-read'.  You will need to do that only rarely.
;;
;;  A use case for variable `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' would be, for
;;  instance, if your code calls other code that calls
;;  `completing-read', so you have no direct access to the
;;  `completing-read' PROMPT argument in order to propertize it.  If
;;  you nevertheless want to use some fancy candidates, then you can
;;  bind `icicle-fancy-candidates-p' with the scope you want.
;;
;;  You use method 3, `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p', when
;;  you need to save and later retrieve all of the information
;;  contained in an alist COLLECTION entry.  Completion returns only a
;;  string.  If the COLLECTION alist has only one entry with a given
;;  string as its car, then you can simply use `assoc' to retrieve the
;;  whole entry.
;;
;;  But if you use an alist that allows entries with different cdrs
;;  for the same car, then you need some way to encode an entire alist
;;  entry in a display string.  When you have this need, set variable
;;  `icicle-candidates-alist' to the alist, and bind
;;  `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to non-`nil'.
;;
;;  This has the effect of encoding, as a text property on the
;;  candidate display string, the entire corresponding original alist
;;  entry.  You can then use `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to recover
;;  that information.
 
;;(@* "Programming Multi-Completions")
;;
;;  Programming Multi-Completions
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Multi-completions are completion candidates that are composed of
;;  parts separated by `icicle-list-join-string'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Completions") for
;;  information about how users interact with multi-completions.
;;
;;  Multi-completions are examples of fancy candidates.
;;  See (@> "Programming with Fancy Candidates").
;;
;;  You can define your own Icicles commands that use
;;  multi-completions.  You can bind `icicle-list-join-string' to any
;;  string you like, depending on your needs.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Key Completion") for an
;;  example where it is bound to the value of option
;;  `icicle-complete-keys-separator' ("  =  " by default).  This
;;  section describes two additional variables that you can bind to
;;  affect the appearance and behavior of multi-completions.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts")
;;  ** Variable icicle-list-use-nth-parts **
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' affects the minibuffer
;;  behavior of multi-completions.  If you bind this to a list of
;;  whole numbers, then multi-completion candidates are transformed
;;  using those numbers as indexes.  During completion and cycling,
;;  whenever a sole candidate matches the user input, if that
;;  candidate is a multi-completion, then it is transformed by
;;  extracting and possibly reordering its parts according to
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  The actual candidate to match is still the original candidate; the
;;  transformation takes place after matching, for final insertion in
;;  the minibuffer.  This means that you must use this feature only
;;  with lax (permissive) completion, since strict completion requires
;;  an exact match against the original completion candidate, and the
;;  transformed candidate will normally not match the original.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' works as follows.  The
;;  matching candidate is split at each `icicle-list-join-string' into
;;  its component parts.  The indexes in `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'
;;  are then used to extract parts, in the same order as the indexes
;;  appear.  The extracted parts are joined back together in an order
;;  that you specify, separated by the value of user option
;;  `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  An index greater than the
;;  number of parts means to use the last part.
;;
;;  For example: If the value of `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' is (1),
;;  then only the first part of the multi-completion is used as the
;;  completion candidate.  If the value is (2 1), then the resulting
;;  candidate is the second part followed by the first part, the two
;;  parts being joined by `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  If the
;;  value is (1 99) and the multi-completion has fewer than 99 parts,
;;  then the first and last parts are used.  If the value is (2 1 2),
;;  then the resulting candidate is composed of the second part
;;  followed by the first part followed by the second part again.
;;
;;  Thus, you can use a given part any number of times.  You can also
;;  mix multi-completions and single-string completions, and you can
;;  mix multi-completions composed of different numbers of strings.
;;  For example, a set of completions might be:
;;
;;  ((("cmd1" "description of cmd1"))
;;   (("cmd2" "description of cmd" "more"))
;;   (("cmd3")))
;;
;;  If you use multi-completions with `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' in
;;  your own commands, please make sure that their doc strings let
;;  users know what to expect, and remind them of the behavior of
;;  option `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.  Let them know, in
;;  particular, that:
;;
;;  * They can match any part of a candidate as it is displayed in
;;    buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * The candidate choice they make will in fact have the form that
;;    you define in your command.
;;
;;  * They can control how the parts are joined, using option
;;    `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'.
;;
;;(@* "Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist")
;;  ** Variable icicle-candidate-properties-alist **
;;
;;  Whereas variable `icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' affects the
;;  appearance of multi-completions in the minibuffer, variable
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' affects their appearance in
;;  buffer `*Completions*'.  You use it to apply text properties to
;;  individual parts of a multi-completion, where the parts are
;;  defined in the same way as for `icicle-list-use-nth-parts'.
;;
;;  This feature affects all candidates the same way.  See also
;;  (@> "Candidates with Text Properties") for ways to apply text
;;  properties to individual candidates (which need not be
;;  multi-completions).
;;
;;  The value of `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' is an alist whose
;;  entries have either of these forms:
;;
;;  (NTH PROPERTIES) or (NTH PROPERTIES JOIN-TOO)
;;
;;  NTH is the number of the target multi-completion part.
;;
;;  PROPERTIES is a list of text properties to apply to the NTH part.
;;
;;  JOIN-TOO is optional.  If it is present and non-`nil', then the
;;  text properties are also applied to the join string that follows
;;  the target part.
;;
;;  You can use any text properties, including `invisible', `keymap',
;;  `display', and properties that you define yourself and that have
;;  meaning to only your code.
;;
;;  As an example of its use, commands `icicle-fundoc',
;;  `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-doc', and `icicle-plist' bind
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to
;;  ((1 (face 'icicle-candidate-part))), so that the first part of
;;  each multi-completion candidate is highlighted using face
;;  `icicle-candidate-part'.
;;
;;  Here is another example value of
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist':
;;
;;  ((3 (face 'underline))
;;   (2 (invisible t) t))
;;
;;  The first entry underlines the third multi-completion part.  The
;;  second entry makes both the second part and the join string that
;;  follows it invisible.
;;
;;  One use of making a completion part invisible is so that you can
;;  sort candidates using it, and let users match input against it,
;;  but not have it appear explicitly.
;;
;;  Recall that `completing-read' displays only the car of each
;;  element present in its COLLECTION (alist) argument.  For example,
;;  if you pass `completing-read' an alist such as (("foo" . 2) ("bar"
;;  . 3)), then only `foo' and `bar' are displayed as candidates.
;;  However, the PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' applies to
;;  the entire alist element, and your command that calls
;;  `completing-read' might well use the chosen candidate (e.g. `foo')
;;  to look up the entire element (e.g. ("foo" . 2)) for further
;;  processing.  Several Icicles commands, including `icicle-search',
;;  do that.
;;
;;  However, sometimes you might want the user to be able to match
;;  against the additional information (e.g. 2 and 3), and you might
;;  want to use it to sort candidates.  In that case, you can use the
;;  alist (("foo 2") ("bar 3")).  In cases where the additional
;;  information can be distracting, you can use multi-completion with
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to hide it: Pass the alist
;;  ((("foo "2")) (("bar" 3"))) and use ((2 (invisible t))) for
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist'.
;;
;;  Keep in mind that hiding completion parts can be confusing to
;;  users.  Do so with care, and let your users know what to expect.
;;  Inform them that there are invisible parts that are nevertheless
;;  taken into account for input matching and candidate sorting.  When
;;  you hide parts, you will often want to omit them from the
;;  minibuffer as well, using `icicle-list-use-nth-parts', to avoid
;;  confusion.
;;
;;  Consider also the position of a hidden part: In some cases you
;;  might want to place it first among the multi-completion parts, but
;;  in many cases you will want to place it last, to minimize
;;  interference with prefix-completion matching.
;;
;;  Similar considerations apply to other text properties, such as
;;  `display' and `keymap', that change the appearance or behavior of
;;  a completion candidate.
;;
;;(@* "What You See Is Not What You Get")
;;  ** What You See Is Not What You Get **
;;
;;  While on the subject of confusing users, let me point out a
;;  general drawback that is common to both
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist': *not* WYSIWYG.  Keep this in
;;  mind if you decide to take advantage of these variables.  Users
;;  see one thing, choose it, and they get something different as a
;;  result.  That promotes confusion that you will need to weigh
;;  against the possible benefits.
;;
;;  Users are confused, because what they choose is not exactly what
;;  they get.  What's more, a user's completion choice is not
;;  reflected in the input history, leading to further confusion.  For
;;  example, Icicles highlighting of previously used inputs in buffer
;;  `*Completions*' does not apply to such a candidate, even though it
;;  was previously entered using `RET'.  It is the transformed
;;  candidate that was entered, not the candidate as it was proposed
;;  for choosing, so when that candidate is proposed again, it is not
;;  recognized as having been previously chosen.
;;
;;  The bottom line here is this: variables
;;  `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
;;  `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' are useful in certain
;;  contexts, but be aware of the downside: confusing your users.

;;
;;  Candidates with Text Properties
;;  -------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Section (@> "Programming Multi-Completions") explains how to apply
;;  text properties to specific parts of all multi-completion
;;  candidates in buffer `*Completions*' at the same time.  This
;;  section tells you how to apply text properties to specific
;;  candidates in `*Completions*'.  The candidates need not be
;;  multi-completions, but in some cases they can be.
;;
;;  When you use candidates with text properties such as `face' that
;;  are visible, the display candidates in `*Completions*' show those
;;  properties.  In addition, the candidate string that the user
;;  finally chooses can also be propertized.
;;
;;  There are four different methods for providing candidates with
;;  text properties, in addition to the way presented in section
;;  (@> "Programming Multi-Completions"):
;;
;;  1. Apply face `icicle-special-candidate' to all candidates that
;;     match a given regexp.
;;
;;  2. Use a set of text properties as the `icicle-special-candidate'
;;     property of the symbol that represents the candidate.  The text
;;     properties are transferred to the string candidate that is
;;     displayed (and returned).
;;
;;  3. Use a propertized string as the `icicle-display-string'
;;     property of the symbol that represents the candidate.  That
;;     string replaces the candidate that would otherwise have been
;;     displayed, completed against, and returned.
;;
;;  4. Start with a propertized string in the COLLECTION argument
;;     that you pass to `completing-read'.
;;
;;  All four methods use fancy candidates, in the sense that they go
;;  beyond what vanilla Emacs offers.  For methods 1-3, you must turn
;;  on fancy-candidate handling.  See
;;  (@> "Programming with Fancy Candidates").
;;
;;  But method 4 does not require any costly fancy-candidate encoding
;;  or decoding, because the Icicles implementation of
;;  `completing-read' handles propertized string candidates, and they
;;  are transparent to the Emacs primitive completion operations.
;;
;;  The following sections explain methods 1-4 individually.
;;
;;(@* "Using Regexp `icicle-special-candidate-regexp'")
;;  ** Using Regexp `icicle-special-candidate-regexp' **
;;
;;  If you just want several candidates to have face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate' in `*Completions', you can simply
;;  define (e.g. bind) option `icicle-special-candidate-regexp' to a
;;  regexp that matches those candidates.  The original candidates can
;;  be strings or symbols.  Unlike the other methods described here,
;;  this one affects only the display in `*Completions'; the
;;  completion return string does not have face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.
;;
;;  The highlighting applies only to the part of a candidate that
;;  matches the regexp.  This selectivity is particularly useful when
;;  dealing with multi-completions.  Function `icicle-read-file-name'
;;  provides an example: file names that match ".+/$", that is,
;;  directory names, are highlighted as special candidates.  Function
;;  `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' provides another example (using the
;;  similar, but internal, variable `icicle-proxy-candidate-regexp'):
;;  proxy color-name candidates such as `*point foreground*' and
;;  `'icicle-region-background'' are highlighted, but not their color
;;  swatches.
;;
;;(@* "Using Property icicle-special-candidate")
;;  ** Using Property icicle-special-candidate **
;;
;;  In this approach, you use the desired list of text properties as
;;  the value of property `icicle-special-candidate' for the symbol
;;  that represents the candidate.  This method affects the candidates
;;  that are used during completion, as well as the completion return
;;  value.
;;
;;  If the candidate is a string, not a symbol, then `intern' it and
;;  put the property on the resulting symbol.  If you want the effect
;;  to be temporary, then set property `icicle-special-candidate' for
;;  the candidate to `nil' when completion is finished.
;;
;;  As a shortcut, if you use the value `t' instead of a property list
;;  for property `icicle-special-candidate', then face
;;  `icicle-special-candidate' will be used as the `face' property of
;;  the candidate.  Using a value of `t' is thus equivalent to using a
;;  value of (face icicle-special-candidate).  This approach is used,
;;  for instance, in the definition of command `icicle-complete-keys'
;;  (`S-TAB').
;;
;;(@* "Using Property `icicle-display-string'")
;;  ** Using Property `icicle-display-string' **
;;
;;  This method is similar to that of using property
;;  `icicle-special-candidate'.  The use case for both is
;;  propertizing, in a general way, candidates that are symbols.  Both
;;  can be useful when you have an obarray as the COLLECTION argument
;;  for `completing-read'.
;;
;;  In this method the symbol name is not used at all; the candidate
;;  is entirely replaced by another string, which is typically
;;  propertized.
;;
;;  You use a propertized string as the value of property
;;  `icicle-display-string' for the candidate symbol.  The propertized
;;  string is displayed in `*Completions*' and returned as the final
;;  completion choice.
;;
;;  Note that multi-completion is not available when you use an
;;  obarray.  Using property `icicle-special-candidate' or
;;  `icicle-display-string' you can propertize candidates and parts of
;;  candidates, but you cannot manipulate multi-completion parts and
;;  there are no join or end strings.
;;
;;(@* "Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String")
;;  ** Applying Text Properties to a Candidate String **
;;
;;  This is the most flexible approach, and it is explained in a bit
;;  more detail.  It can be used with multi-completions, and it
;;  affects the `*Completions*' display and the completion return
;;  value.  However, it is limited to using an alist or list of
;;  strings, not an obarray, as the COLLECTION argument to
;;  `completing-read'.
;;
;;  In this approach, you simply apply the text properties to the
;;  string(s) that represent the candidate, which you then pass to
;;  `completing-read' in its COLLECTION parameter.
;;
;;  As with the other methods, you can use any text properties you
;;  like, including these:
;;
;;  * `face' - to make some completion candidates stand out in
;;    particular ways
;;
;;  * `icicle-mode-line-help' - candidate help shown in the mode-line
;;    when the candidate is current, provided option
;;    `icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay' is greater than zero (only the
;;    first character of a candidate string is tested for this text
;;    property).
;;
;;    If the property value is not a string then it should be a
;;    function, which is applied to the candidate string to obtain the
;;    help string.
;;
;;  * `help-echo':
;;     - same as `icicle-mode-line-help', if that property is `nil'
;;     - candidate help shown in a mouseover tooltip, provided
;;       `tooltip-mode' is on
;;
;;  * `keymap' and `pointer' - for individualized mouse treatment of
;;    candidates
;;
;;  * `display' - to include images in candidates
;;
;;  * `invisible' - to hide part or all of particular candidates
;;    (which are nevertheless available for completion)
;;
;;  As a convenience, you can use function
;;  `icicle-candidate-short-help' to apply both
;;  `icicle-mode-line-help' and `help-echo' text properties to a
;;  candidate string.
;;
;;  How does this work?  Icicles redefines the standard Emacs function
;;  `display-completion-list' so that it retains text properties.
;;  Emacs should do the same, but it does not (yet).
;;
;;  Icicles command `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' presents an
;;  illustration, using the `face' property.  (It also uses properties
;;  `icicle-mode-line-help' and `help-echo', to provide RGB and HSV
;;  information in the mode-line and via tooltip.)
;;
;;  In `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG', a multi-completion candidate is
;;  used, composed of an unpropertized string that names a color and a
;;  propertized string that names its RGB (red, green, blue) value.
;;  The RGB string, by default, has a background of the same color -
;;  each completion candidate is thus accompanied by its own color
;;  swatch.
;;
;;  The code that does this is function `icicle-make-color-candidate',
;;  which is used by `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' and other Icicles
;;  commands that read colors.  Here is a simplified definition:
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-color-candidate (color-name)
;;     "Return candidate of COLOR-NAME and its hex RGB string.
;;   If `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' is non-nil, then the hex RGB
;;   string has the color as its background text property."
;;     (let ((rgb-string  (hexrgb-color-name-to-hex color-name)))
;;       (when icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag
;;         (put-text-property
;;           0 (length rgb-string) 'face
;;           (cons 'background-color rgb-string) rgb-string))
;;       (list (list color-name rgb-string))))
;;
;;  You'll notice that the face property is added only when option
;;  `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' is non-`nil'.  You can toggle
;;  this option during completion, using `C-S-pause', to change the
;;  behavior.  (The new value takes effect for the next act of
;;  completion.)
;;
;;  You can match any part of the multi-completion: color name or RGB
;;  value.  Command `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' defines a set of sort
;;  orders that are pertinent to the color candidates.
;;
;;  You can use `C-,' to sort by color name, amount of red, blue,
;;  green, all RGB components (in order), RGB distance from a base
;;  color, hue, saturation, value, all HSV components (in order), or
;;  HSV distance from a base color.
;;
;;  If option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' is non-`nil', then
;;  command `icicle-read-color-WYSIWYG' includes proxy completion
;;  candidates that are not color-name-and-RGB pairs.  As always, you
;;  can toggle the use of proxy candidates using `C-M-_' in the
;;  minibuffer.
;;
;;  The proxy candidates for colors include the single-quoted names of
;;  user options (variables) whose custom type is `color'.  So, for
;;  example, option `icicle-region-background' appears as proxy color
;;  candidate `'icicle-region-background''.  Color proxies also
;;  include the following:
;;
;;  * `*copied foreground*'  - last copied foreground, if available
;;  * `*copied background*'  - last copied background, if available
;;  * `*mouse-2 foreground*' - foreground where you click `mouse-2'
;;  * `*mouse-2 background*' - background where you click `mouse-2'
;;  * `*point foreground*'   - foreground under the text cursor
;;  * `*point background*'   - background under the text cursor
;;
;;  When you choose a proxy color candidates, the color referred to is
;;  used.  For example, `*point foreground*' means to use the
;;  foreground color at the cursor position (point), whatever it might
;;  be.  Choosing a `mouse-2' candidate lets you then click `mouse-2'
;;  to pick up a color somewhere.  If you use library `palette.el' or
;;  `eyedropper.el', and you have already copied a color, then you can
;;  choose `*copied foreground*' (or background) to use that color.
;;
;;  Icicles treats reading face names similarly to reading colors, by
;;  redefining standard function `read-face-name' when you are in
;;  Icicle mode.  In this case, multi-completions are not used.  The
;;  pertinent function is `icicle-make-face-candidate', which provides
;;  a WYSIWYG face sample whenever `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag'
;;  is non-`nil'.
;;
;;  A string value for `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' presents the
;;  face name accompanied by that string as a separate sample swatch.
;;  A value of `t' presents the face name itself in the face it names.
;;
;;   (defun icicle-make-face-candidate (face)
;;     "Return a completion candidate for FACE.
;;   The value of option `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' determines
;;   the kind of candidate to use.

;;    If a string, then a multi-completion candidate is used, with the
;;    face name followed by a sample swatch using FACE on the string's
;;    text.
;;

;;  Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)
;;  ----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;(@* "Nothing To It!")
;;  ** Nothing To It! **
;;
;;  Defining a command that uses Icicles completion and cycling is
;;  simple: just call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' to read
;;  input, then act on that input.
;;
;;  Nothing could be simpler - just use `completing-read'or
;;  `read-file-name'!  Icicles does the rest.  This is the most
;;  important thing to learn about defining Icicles commands: you do
;;  not need to do anything except call `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name' as you would normally anyway.
;;
;;  Or at least as I HOPE you would normally.  I fear that many
;;  Emacs-Lisp programmers do not take sufficient advantage of
;;  `completing-read' when they could, using instead a function such
;;  as (quel horreur !)  `read-string' to read user input.
;;
;;(@* "Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too")
;;  ** Multi-Commands Are Easy To Define Too **
;;
;;  If defining an Icicles command is trivial, so is defining an
;;  Icicles multi-command.  For the same effort it takes to define a
;;  command that acts on a single input choice, you can have a command
;;  that acts on any number of input choices.  A multi-command takes
;;  advantage of one or more action functions when cycling candidates,
;;  as described in sections
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands"),
;;  (@> "More about Multi-Commands"), and
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Choose All Completion Candidates").
;;
;;  In fact, there is no reason NOT to define your commands as
;;  multi-commands - you lose nothing, and you gain a lot.  Whenever
;;  it is appropriate for a user to possibly want to act on multiple
;;  objects, define a multi-command that does that.
;;
;;  An anecdote, to make the point.  An Icicles user sent me an email
;;  saying how much he appreciated Icicles multi-commands, and asking
;;  if I would add a multi-command version of `insert-buffer'.  I did
;;  so, but I replied to him that the definition is trivial: it is
;;  identical to the definition of `icicle-buffer', except that the
;;  action function is `insert-buffer' instead of `switch-to-buffer'.
;;
;;  The point is to not be afraid of defining multi-commands yourself.
;;  You do not really need to have me add a multi-command to Icicles
;;  in most cases; you can easily define it yourself.  Here is a
;;  simple definition of `icicle-insert-buffer'.  You will understand
;;  it in detail after reading the next section.
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command icicle-insert-buffer
;;     "Multi-command version of `insert-buffer'." ; Doc string

;;     (icicle-default-buffer-names current-prefix-arg) nil)
;;
;;  Macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  make it easy to define a multi-command.  Without them, it is
;;  sometimes not so easy, depending on the complexity of your action
;;  functions.  See (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way") for a
;;  taste of what is involved.  If you read that section first, make
;;  sure you come back here to see how easy things can be.
;;
;;  Here is how you might define a multi-command to delete one or more
;;  files or directories:
;;
;;  1. Define the multi-command, `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  (icicle-define-file-command
;;   my-delete-file                  ; Command name
;;   "Delete a file or directory."   ; Doc string
;;   my-delete-file-or-directory     ; Function to perform the action
;;   "Delete file or directory: "    ; `read-file-name' arguments...
;;   default-directory nil t)
;;
;;  2. Define the action function that deletes a single file:
;;
;;  (defun my-delete-file-or-directory (file)
;;    "Delete file (or directory) FILE."
;;    (condition-case i-delete-file
;;        (if (eq t (car (file-attributes file)))
;;            (delete-directory file)
;;          (delete-file file))
;;      (error (message "%s" (error-message-string i-delete-file))
;;             (error "%s" (error-message-string i-delete-file)))))
;;
;;  There are two parts to the definition of `my-delete-file':
;;
;;  1. The definition of the command itself, using
;;     `icicle-define-file-command'.
;;
;;  2. The definition of an action function,
;;     `my-delete-file-or-directory', which deletes a single file (or
;;     directory), given its name.
;;
;;  It is #1 that is of interest here, because that is essentially
;;  what you do to define any multi-command.
;;
;;  The details of #2 are less interesting, even if more complex in
;;  this case: `my-delete-file-or-directory' checks whether its
;;  argument is a file or directory, and then tries to delete it.  If
;;  an error occurs, it prints the error message and then returns the
;;  message, so that the calling command can report on all deletion
;;  errors.
;;
;;  In #1, the arguments to `icicle-define-file-command' are
;;  straightforward:
;;
;;  * The name of the command being defined `my-delete-file'.
;;
;;  * Its doc string.
;;
;;  * The function that actually performs the action on the input file
;;    name - `my-delete-file-or-directory'.
;;
;;  * The arguments that you would supply anyway to `read-file-name'
;;    to read a single file name.
;;
;;  These are the SAME things you would need if you were defining a
;;  simple command to delete a SINGLE file or directory.  The only
;;  differences here are that you:
;;
;;  * Use `icicle-define-file-command' instead of `defun' with an
;;    `interactive' spec.
;;
;;  * Separate the action code into a separate function (here,
;;    `my-delete-file-or-directory') that acts on a single object
;;    (here, a file).
;;
;;  When you use `icicle-define-file-command', the action function is
;;  called on the result of `read-file-name', and it is also bound to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn', so that it will be applied to the
;;  current candidate via `C-RET' or `C-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-all-candidates-action' (`C-!' -- see
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Choose All Completion Candidates"))
;;  can report in buffer `*Help*' on the objects that it did not act
;;  upon successfully.  For this reporting to work, the function bound
;;  to `icicle-candidate-action-fn'
;;  (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory', above) should return `nil'
;;  for "success" and non-`nil' (for example, an error message) for
;;  "failure", whatever "success" and "failure" might mean in the
;;  particular context of use.  This is not a requirement, except if
;;  you want to take advantage of such reporting.  For a command that
;;  deletes files, it is important to let the user know which
;;  deletions failed when s?he tries to delete all matching candidates
;;  at once.
;;
;;  If the command you want to define acts on objects other than
;;  files, then use `icicle-define-command' instead of
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' - the only difference is that you
;;  then supply the arguments for `completing-read' instead of those
;;  for `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  To let users know that a command is a multi-command, and how to
;;  use it as such, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' automatically add this explanation to
;;  the doc string you provide for the multi-command:
;;
;;  ---
;;  Read input, then call `<your action function name>' to act on it.
;;
;;  Input-candidate completion and cycling are available.  While
;;  cycling, these keys with prefix `C-' are active:
;;
;;  `C-mouse-2', `C-RET' - Act on current completion candidate only
;;  `C-down', `C-wheel-down'-Move to next completion candidate and act
;;  `C-up', `C-wheel-up'-Move to previous completion candidate and act
;;  `C-next'  - Move to next apropos-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-prior' - Move to previous apropos-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-end'   - Move to next prefix-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-home'  - Move to previous prefix-completion candidate and act
;;  `C-!'    - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)
;;
;;  When candidate action and cycling are combined (e.g. `C-next'), user
;;  option `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag' determines which occurs first.
;;
;;  With prefix `C-M-' instead of `C-', the same keys (`C-M-mouse-2',
;;  `C-M-RET', `C-M-down', and so on) provide help about candidates.
;;
;;  Use `mouse-2', `RET' or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or
;;  `C-g' to quit.
;;
;;  This is an Icicles command - see `icicle-mode'.
;;  ---
;;
;;  Notice that the doc string of your new multi-command references
;;  your action function (e.g. `my-delete-file-or-directory').  The
;;  doc string you provide for the multi-command can thus be a little
;;  more abstract, leaving any detailed explanation of the action to
;;  the doc string of your action function.
;;
;;  To provide more flexibility, `icicle-define-command' and
;;  `icicle-define-file-command' provide some predefined key bindings
;;  and allow for additional arguments.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a multi-command, `change-font', that reads
;;  a font name and changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;
;;  1  (icicle-define-command
;;  2   change-font "Change font of current frame."
;;  3   (lambda (font)
;;  4     (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  5                              (list (cons 'font font))))
;;  6   "Font: " (mapcar #'list (x-list-fonts "*"))
;;  7   nil t nil nil nil nil
;;  8   ((orig-frame  (selected-frame))
;;  9    (orig-font   (frame-parameter nil 'font)))
;;  10  nil
;;  11  (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  12                           (list (cons 'font orig-font)))
;;  13  nil)
;;
;;  The arguments to `icicle-define-command' here are as follows:
;;
;;  Command name    (line 2)
;;  Doc string      (line 2)
;;  Action function (lines 3-5)
;;  Args passed to `completing-read' (lines 6-7)
;;  Additional bindings (lines 8-9)
;;  Additional initialization code (line 10)
;;  "Undo" code to run in case of error or user quit (lines 11-12)
;;  Additional code to run at the end (line 13)
;;
;;  The following bindings are predefined - you can refer to them in
;;  the command body:
;;
;;   `icicle-orig-buff'   is bound to (current-buffer)
;;   `icicle-orig-window' is bound to (selected-window)
;;
;;  Before running any "undo" code that you supply, the original
;;  buffer is restored, in case of error or user quit (`C-g').
;;
;;  Most of the arguments to `icicle-define-command' are optional.  In
;;  this case, optional arguments were provided to save (lines 8-9)
;;  and then restore (lines 11-12) the original font and frame.

;;
;;(@* "Are Users Dependent on Icicles To Use Multi-Commands?")
;;  ** Are Users Dependent on Icicles To Use Multi-Commands? **
;;
;;  For users to be able to take advantage of the Icicles features
;;  that your multi-command provides, they must load Icicles.  You can
;;  do this for them, by adding (require 'icicles nil t) to your code.
;;  The last two arguments mean that no error will be raised if for
;;  some reason Icicles cannot be found or successfully loaded.
;;
;;  But that brings up another question: What happens to your
;;  multi-command if Icicles is not available for a user, or s?he does
;;  not want to load it?  No problem - your multi-command then
;;  automatically turns into a normal, single-choice command -
;;  graceful degradation.
;;
;;  Similarly, users can always turn off `icicle-mode' at any time, to
;;  return to the standard Emacs behavior.
;;
;;  Users will, in any case, need to load Icicles at compile time, in
;;  order to byte-compile your library that calls macro
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' - either
;;  that, or you can duplicate the definition of the macro in your
;;  library.  To let users load Icicles at (only) compile time, add
;;  this to your library that defines multi-commands:
;;
;;  (eval-when-compile '(require icicles))

;;
;;  Defining Icicles Tripping Commands
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  Section (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Icicles Tripping")
;;  describes the use of Icicles tripping (aka navigation or browsing)
;;  multi-commands.  This section tells you how to define your own
;;  such commands for custom trips - it is thus for Emacs-Lisp
;;  programmers.
;;
;;  The best way to learn how to do this is to look at how the
;;  existing tripping commands are defined.  Some of them use macro
;;  `icicle-define-command'; others do not.  Some use building-block
;;  function `icicle-explore' or `icicle-apply'; others do not.
;;  Several use `icicle-search' as a building block.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-define-command'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-define-command' **
;;
;;  Those that use `icicle-define-command' take advantage of some
;;  extraneous way to obtain trip location information from a display
;;  candidate, which is just a string.  For example, `icicle-bookmark'
;;  ultimately uses the display string to look up location information
;;  in a bookmarks file.  Those that use `icicle-explore' or
;;  `icicle-apply' make use of location information stored in the
;;  alist COLLECTION argument to `completing-read'.
;;
;;  You can also use `icicle-define-command', `icicle-explore', and
;;  `icicle-apply' to define multi-commands other than browsing
;;  commands - the action function can do anything you like.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-explore'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-explore' **
;;
;;  `icicle-explore' is a higher-order function that takes as
;;  arguments the following functions, in addition to accepting
;;  the optional `completing-read' arguments.
;;
;;  * A function to build a candidates alist (COLLECTION) for
;;    completion.  It fills `icicle-candidates-alist' with the
;;    candidates, each of which is a cons with a display candidate
;;    string as car and (typically) location information as cdr.  For
;;    example, `icicle-find-tag' uses the tag text as display
;;    candidate and the standard tag-locating information as the cdr:
;;    tag info, file path, and goto function.
;;
;;  * A function that acts on the candidate finally chosen (`RET'),
;;    when completion is finished.
;;
;;  * A function to call if the user hits `C-g' during completion.
;;
;;  * A function to call if an error is raised during completion.
;;
;;  * A function to call after completion is finished, to clean things
;;    up.
;;
;;  If you also bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that
;;  takes a display candidate (string) as argument and navigates to
;;  the corresponding location, then `icicle-explore' does everything
;;  you need for an Icicles trip.  You can use function
;;  `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to get the location information for a
;;  given display candidate.
;;
;;  Note: `icicle-explore' binds user option
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion' to `always', because I think you
;;  typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
;;  on.  Functions that call `icicle-explore' thus also turn on
;;  incremental completion.  This includes the predefined Icicles
;;  commands `icicle-find-tag' and `icicle-search', and the many
;;  specialized Icicles search commands derived from `icicle-search'.
;;  Remember that you can use `C-#' (once or twice) to turn
;;  incremental completion off.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-apply'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-apply' **
;;
;;  `icicle-apply' binds `icicle-candidate-action-fn' appropriately
;;  and calls `icicle-explore'.  It applies its function argument to
;;  completion candidates the user acts on (using `C-RET' etc.).  It
;;  applies the function to the full alist entry, that is, the display
;;  candidate car plus any additional information in the cdr.  For a
;;  tripping command, the additional information provides a location
;;  and the function applied takes you there.
;;
;;  This use of an alist that stores location information in the cdrs
;;  is what makes `icicle-apply' and `icicle-explore' particularly
;;  suitable for defining navigation multi-commands.  The Icicles
;;  macros `icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  make no such provision, but with suitable arguments you can use
;;  them too to define tripping commands.
;;
;;  Note: `icicle-apply' binds user option
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion' to `always', because I think you
;;  typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
;;  on.  Functions that call `icicle-apply' thus also turn on
;;  incremental completion.  This includes the predefined Icicles
;;  commands `icicle-goto-marker', `icicle-goto-any-marker', and
;;  `icicle-goto-global-marker'.  Remember that you can use `C-#'
;;  (once or twice) to turn incremental completion off.
;;
;;(@* "Using `icicle-search'")
;;  ** Using `icicle-search' **
;;
;;  `icicle-search' is another high-level function for defining
;;  tripping commands.  Like `icicle-apply', it calls
;;  `icicle-explore', but it also provides features for searching
;;  bookmarks, buffers, and files.  It takes as arguments the search
;;  limits (region), if any, and either a regexp or a function that
;;  determines the unfiltered search hits.  It does everything else
;;  needed to define a trip command that uses search hits as
;;  completion candidates.  Several predefined Icicles tripping
;;  commands were defined using `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  Note: `icicle-search' effectively binds user option
;;  `icicle-incremental-completion' to `always', because I think you
;;  typically want to start it out with incremental completion turned
;;  on.  Other Icicles search commands are defined using
;;  `icicle-search', so they also effectively turn on incremental
;;  completion.  Remember that you can use `C-#' (once or twice) to
;;  turn it off.
;;
;;(@* "Tripping on Foot")
;;  ** Tripping on Foot **
;;
;;  You should be able to define any tripping commands you need using
;;  `icicle-explore', `icicle-apply', or `icicle-search'.
;;
;;  If, however, for some reason you decide to define one at a lower,
;;  pedestrian level (that is, without using any of those building
;;  blocks), then bind `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to `t'
;;  around the call to `completing-read'.  You can then use
;;  `icicle-get-alist-candidate' to retrieve the candidate cdr
;;  (e.g. location) information from the completion result.
;;
;;  However, if the action or alternative action function that you
;;  need modifies the existing set of completion candidates on the
;;  fly, as a side effect, then bind
;;  `icicle-whole-candidate-as-text-prop-p' to `nil' in the action
;;  function.  Then modify both `minibuffer-completion-table' and
;;  `icicle-candidates-alist' as needed to perform the side effect.
;;
;;  Icicles search-and-replace provides an example of this.  When you
;;  replace text, the original domain of search-hit candidates (with
;;  their associated location information) is altered, so that you can
;;  continue replacing coherently.  (See the code for
;;  `icicle-search-action' and
;;  `icicle-search-highlight-and-maybe-replace'.)
;;
;;  Because such side effects can change the meaning of cycling state
;;  information such as the current candidate number, Icicles does not
;;  automatically save such state information before a candidate
;;  action and then restore it afterward.
;;
;;  For example, search-and-replace removes a search-hit candidate, as
;;  a side effect, if the replacement text no longer matches your
;;  input.  In that case, a current candidate number recorded before
;;  the action would no longer correspond to the same candidate.
;;
;;  For this reason, if your action function does not perform any such
;;  side effects on the candidates, and you want to restore the
;;  cycling state as it was before a candidate action, then you might
;;  want your action function to save and then restore the values of
;;  Icicles variables such as `icicle-candidate-nb',
;;  `icicle-last-completion-candidate', and
;;  `icicle-completion-candidates'.

;;  cycling, a user can also display them in buffer `*Completions*'
;;  using `TAB' or `S-TAB', and click them there to choose them.
;;
;;  That is, buffer `*Completions*' can act as a multiple-choice menu.
;;
;;  Simple use case: Suppose that you use special characters (Greek
;;  letters, math symbols, accented letters in another language...),
;;  but only occasionally - you do not want to take the trouble to
;;  learn a special input method for them or flip to a different soft
;;  keyboard.  One simple way to handle this is to create a menu of
;;  such special characters - Greek letters, for instance.  You only
;;  need to create the menu once, providing the necessary completions
;;  as, say, Unicode characters.  When you need to input such a
;;  character, just use your command that pops up buffer
;;  `*Completions*' with the available special characters.  Even if
;;  you do not know how to type them on your keyboard, you can cycle
;;  through them or use `mouse-2' to choose them.
;;
;;  Here's a simple example of defining a command that uses a
;;  multiple-choice menu.  (Other examples given above, such as
;;  `my-delete-file-or-directory' are also examples, but this one uses
;;  menu items that look more like menu items.)
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command my-menu-command
;;      "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;      my-menu-action
;;      "`TAB' for menu.  `C-mouse-2' to choose. "
;;      my-menu-items nil t)
;;
;;  (defvar my-menu-items
;;    '(("Foobar" . foobar-fn) ("Toto" . toto-fn) ("Titi" . titi-fn))
;;    "Alist of menu items and their associated commands.")
;;
;;  (defun my-menu-action (item)
;;    "Call function associated with menu-item ITEM."
;;    (funcall (cdr (assoc item my-menu-items))))
;;
;;  (defun foobar-fn () (message "Foobar chosen"))
;;  (defun toto-fn () (message "Toto chosen"))
;;  (defun titi-fn () (message "Titi chosen"))
;;
;;  A user does `M-x my-menu-command' and hits `TAB' to display this
;;  menu in the `*Completions*' buffer:
;;
;;  Click mouse-2 on a completion to select it.  (C-h: help)
;;
;;  Possible completions are:
;;  Foobar          Titi
;;  Toto
;;
;;  The user presses and holds the Control key.  S?he clicks `Foobar'
;;  - message "Foobar chosen" appears.  S?he clicks `Toto - message
;;  "Toto chosen" appears.
;;
;;  And so on - all while holding Control pressed.  Any number of menu
;;  items can be chosen, any number of times.  The command is finally
;;  exited with `RET' or `C-g'.
;;
;;  The COLLECTION argument passed to `completing-read' here is
;;  `my-menu-items', an alist of key-value pairs, where the key is a
;;  menu-item name and the value is the function that implements the
;;  menu item.  For example, menu item `Foobar' is implemented by
;;  function `foobar-fn', and the alist element is therefore ("Foobar"
;;  . foobar-fn).
;;
;;  Function `my-menu-action' is executed when a user clicks
;;  `C-mouse-2' on a menu item.  It just looks up the menu item's
;;  function in alist `my-menu-items', and then calls that function.
;;
;;  What?  You think it's odd that the user must hit `TAB' to display
;;  the menu?  Then just use this code instead:
;;
;;  (icicle-define-command
;;   my-menu-command
;;   "Display menu and act on choice(s)."
;;   my-menu-action
;;   "`C-mouse-2' or `C-RET' to choose menu items"
;;   my-menu-items nil t nil nil nil nil
;;   ((icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag t)))
;;
;;  This just adds a binding for
;;  `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag', so that `*Completions*'
;;  is displayed initially.
;;
;;  Granted, the `*Completions*' display does not exactly look like
;;  your average menu.  And the header line does not mention the
;;  multiple-choice possibility (holding Control while clicking).  But
;;  the header does say to use `C-h' for help, and that help does
;;  mention `C-mouse-2' (as does the prompt).  And the menu does act
;;  like a menu.  And the doc string of `my-menu-command' can provide
;;  more help, as needed.
;;
;;  There are also some freebie advantages of using such menus,
;;  besides the feature of multiple-choice.  These include choosing
;;  menu items from the keyboard, with completion, and cycling among
;;  menu items.  The additional features are all explained when the
;;  user hits `M-?'.
;;
;;  One common use of a multiple-choice menu is letting the user
;;  select a list of items from a larger list of candidates.  The list
;;  is returned, with the items in the order selected.  Examples of
;;  this include these multi-commands:
;;
;;  * `icicle-bookmark-list' - bookmarks (bookmark names, with `C-u')
;;
;;  * `icicle-buffer-list' - buffer names, selected from `buffer-list'
;;    (possibly after filtering)
;;
;;  * `icicle-directory-list' - directory names, selected from
;;    subdirectories in the current directory and any directories you
;;    navigate to (and values of directory-list variables)
;;
;;  * `icicle-face-list' - face names, selected from `face-list'
;;
;;  * `icicle-file-list' - file names, selected from files in the
;;    current directory and any directories you navigate to
;;
;;  * `icicle-keyword-list' - keywords (regexps), selected from those
;;    you have previously entered
;;
;;  * `icicle-choose-faces', `icicle-choose-visible-faces',
;;    `icicle-choose-invisible-faces' - face names, selected from the
;;    (visible/invisible) highlighting faces in the buffer
;;
;;  Such commands can be used on their own, or they can be used in the
;;  `interactive' specs of other commands that act on an entire list
;;  of selected items.  And do not forget that the set of "menu items"
;;  (completion candidates) is susceptible to sorting in various ways,
;;  as well as filtering in the usual ways: progressive completion,
;;  chipping away the non-elephant, and so on.
;;
;;  Here as an example definition is `icicle-file-list':
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command icicle-file-list
;;     "Choose a list of file names.
;;   The list of names (strings) is returned."

;;
;;  The definition of `icicle-execute-extended-command' provides an

;;  function, in case the candidate is a command that reads input with

;;

;;         (call-interactively cmd 'record-it))
;;       (setq icicle-new-last-cmd  cmd)))
;;
;;  Variables `icicle-orig-buff' and `icicle-orig-window' are bound
;;  automatically by macro `icicle-define-command' to the buffer and
;;  window where the multi-command (`icicle-execute-extended-command'
;;  in this case) was invoked.
;;
;;  The last several lines of this action function rebind
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a function that calls the
;;  candidate command on a single argument that it reads.  This is
;;  useful if that command itself reads an input argument with
;;  completion.  When that is the case, you can use completion on that
;;  input, and if you do that, you can use `C-RET' to use the
;;  candidate command `as a multi-command.  In other words, this
;;  binding allows for two levels of multi-commands.
;;
;;  There are a few things wrong with this definition, however.  In
;;  the action function, the candidate command is applied to a
;;  candidate that is a string.  What if it is a command, such as
;;  `describe-variable', that expects a symbol argument?  Or a number
;;  argument?  There is no way to know what kind of command will be
;;  used, and what kind of argument it will need.  The solution is to
;;  first try a string candidate argument, then convert the string to
;;  a symbol or number.  That is, bind this to
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn':
;;
;;  (lambda (x)
;;    (setq x  (icicle-transform-multi-completion x))
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall ',cmd x)   ; Try to use a string candidate.  If that
;;      (wrong-type-argument ; did not work, use a symbol or number.
;;       (funcall ',cmd (car (read-from-string x))))))
;;
;;  A similar problem occurs if the action function called does not
;;  accept a (single) argument.  The best thing to do in this case is
;;  punt - call `icicle-help-on-candidate' to display help on the
;;  candidate. To the code above, we add another error handler:
;;
;;  (wrong-number-of-arguments (funcall #'icicle-help-on-candidate))
;;
;;  And what if the command does something that changes the focus away
;;  from the minibuffer's frame?  That's the case for
;;  `describe-variable', for instance: it selects buffer `*Help*'.  To
;;  fix this potential problem, the action function resets the focus
;;  back to the minibuffer and its frame:
;;
;;  (lambda (x)
;;    (setq x  (icicle-transform-multi-completion x))
;;    (condition-case nil
;;        (funcall ',cmd x)
;;      (wrong-type-argument
;;       (funcall ',cmd (car (read-from-string x))))
;;      (wrong-number-of-arguments
;;       (funcall #'icicle-help-on-candidate)))
;;    (select-window (minibuffer-window))
;;    (select-frame-set-input-focus
;;      (window-frame (minibuffer-window))))
;;
;;  The actual definitions of the action function and the main command
;;  are even more complex.  They need to take into account various
;;  subtleties, including those associated with recursive minibuffers
;;  and multiple invocations of `completing-read'.  Evaluate
;;  (symbol-function 'icicle-execute-extended-command) to see the real
;;  definition.

;;
;;  Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way
;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.  It gives you a taste
;;  of what is involved behind the scene when you effortlessly use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command' to define
;;  a multi-command.
;;  See (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)").
;;
;;  It can be good to know this, if only for the case where you need
;;  to define a multi-command that has special behavior not provided
;;  by `icicle-define(-file)-command' out of the box.  For example, if
;;  you want the normal, single-choice `RET' behavior to be different
;;  from the multiple-choice `C-RET' behavior, then you might want to
;;  roll your own.  Likewise, if you want to define your own help on
;;  individual candidates, to be invoked when users use `C-M-RET' and
;;  so on.
;;
;;  To write your own multi-command, you must make the command do
;;  this:
;;
;;  1. Call `completing-read' or `read-file-name', and perform some
;;     action on the completed input.
;;
;;  2. Bind one or more of these variables to action functions, which
;;     each take a completion candidate as argument:
;;
;;     a. `icicle-candidate-action-fn' - a function that performs an
;;        action on a completion candidate - often the same action as
;;        #1.
;;
;;     b. `icicle-candidates-list-action-fn' - a function that
;;        performs an action on the list of all completion candidates.
;;
;;     c. `icicle-candidate-alt-action-fn' - a function that performs
;;        an alternative action on a completion candidate.
;;
;;     d. `icicle-candidates-list-alt-action-fn' - a function that
;;        performs an alternative action on the list of candidates.
;;
;;     e. `icicle-candidate-help-fn' - a function that displays
;;        specialized help for a completion candidate.
;;
;;        (You can also provide mode-line help and tooltip help for
;;        individual candidates.
;;        See "Candidates with Text Properties".)
;;
;;     f. `icicle-delete-candidate-object' - a function that deletes
;;        an object associated with (e.g. named by) a completion
;;        candidate.
;;
;;  #1 just lets people use the command normally, to perform the #1
;;  action on a completion candidate entered with `RET'.  Because of
;;  #2, people can perform the #2 action(s) on any completion
;;  candidates, while still continuing to cycle or complete
;;  candidates.  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' is often the same as the
;;  action for #1, but nothing prevents you from using different
;;  actions.
;;
;;  When internal variable `icicle-candidate-action-fn' is not bound,
;;  the default action is performed: display help on the current
;;  completion candidate.  When `icicle-candidate-help-fn' is not
;;  bound, the default help display is used.
;;
;;  Instead of binding `icicle-delete-candidate-object' to a deletion
;;  action function, you can bind it to a symbol (variable) whose
;;  value is a list of completion-candidate objects.
;;  See (@> "More about Multi-Commands") for more information.
;;
;;  Here is a definition of a simple (not multi-) command that reads a
;;  font name and then changes the selected frame to use that font.
;;  By virtue of calling `completing-read', Icicles completion and
;;  cycling are available, using all available font names as the pool
;;  of candidates.
;;
;;  (defun change-font ()
;;    "Change font of selected frame."
;;    (modify-frame-parameters
;;     (selected-frame)
;;     (list (cons 'font (completing-read

;;                        nil t)))))
;;
;;  Here's a definition of a multi-command `change-font' that takes
;;  advantage of an action function when cycling candidates:
;;
;;  1  (defun change-font ()
;;  2    "Change font of current frame."
;;  3    (interactive)
;;  4   (let* ((orig-frame  (selected-frame))

;;  6          (icicle-candidate-action-fn
;;  7           ;; Perform the action on a candidate, without leaving
;;  8           ;; `completing-read'.  You can do this over and over.
;;  9           (lambda (font)
;;  10             (modify-frame-parameters orig-frame
;;  11                                      (list (cons 'font font))))))
;;  12     (condition-case nil
;;  13         (modify-frame-parameters
;;  14          orig-frame
;;  15          (list
;;  16           (cons 'font
;;  17                 ;; Perform the action on your final choice.
;;  18                 (completing-read
;;  19                  "Font: "
;;  20                  (mapcar #'list (x-list-fonts "*")) nil t))))
;;  21       ((quit error)
;;  22        (modify-frame-parameters
;;  23         orig-frame
;;  24         (list (cons 'font orig-font)))))))
;;
;;  As you can see, there is a lot more going on here than in the
;;  simple-command version.  These are the points to keep in mind,
;;  when defining a multi-command by hand:
;;
;;  1. Save anything you need to restore, so you can, in effect, undo
;;     the action in case of `C-g' (lines 4-5).
;;
;;  2. Bind `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to the action to perform
;;     (lines 6-11).
;;
;;  3. Perform the action, using `completing-read' to provide the
;;     target candidate (lines 13-20).  Do this in the body of a
;;     `condition-case' (lines 12-24).
;;
;;  4. Restore the original context in the error-handling part of the
;;     `condition-case' (lines 22-24).  Include `quit' in the
;;     error-type list.
;;
;;  The above definition is not quite complete, in fact.  To let
;;  `icicle-all-candidates' be able to report on failures, the
;;  `icicle-candidate-action-fn' code should also trap errors and
;;  return `nil' as a success indicator.
;;
;;  In fact, things can get even hairier (much hairier) still, if the
;;  function at the core of your command does things like create a new
;;  frame - especially on MS Windows, with its click-to-focus window
;;  manager.  The action of `change-font' does not do that, but if it
;;  did, you would need to redirect the focus back to the minibuffer
;;  frame, using `select-frame-set-input-focus'.  As an illustration
;;  of what's involved, here's a definition that would deal with such
;;  problems.  It also traps `icicle-candidate-action-fn' errors,
;;  returning `nil' to report success and the error message to report
;;  failure.

;;
;;  Global Filters
;;  --------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Which completion candidates get displayed?  To review:
;;
;;  1. The domain of discourse, that is, all possible candidates, is
;;     determined by the arguments to `completing-read',
;;     `read-file-name', or `M-x'.
;;
;;  2. A user types something in the minibuffer.  This narrows the
;;     possible candidates to those that match the input.  Matching
;;     can be prefix-matching or apropos-matching.
;;
;;  Wouldn't it sometimes be useful to filter #1 in a global way,
;;  before filtering it with the user input (#2)?  Functions
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name' take a predicate argument,
;;  so that can be used for global filtering.  However, those
;;  functions are usually called from some command, and it would also
;;  be useful to give end users, not just programmers, some way to
;;  globally filter candidates.
;;
;;  For example, if you have a command, such as `icicle-buffer', that
;;  reads a buffer name and displays the buffer, some users might
;;  always be interested only in buffers that are associated with
;;  files.  They do not want to see possible candidates such as
;;  `*scratch*' and `*Messages*'.  What they need is a way to apply a
;;  global predicate that limits candidates to file-buffer names - but
;;  they do not have access to the call to `completing-read' that is
;;  inside the command definition.
;;
;;  For this reason, some global filtering variables are provided by
;;  Icicles:
;;
;;    `icicle-must-match-regexp', `icicle-must-not-match-regexp',
;;    `icicle-must-pass-predicate',
;;    `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate',
;;    `icicle-extra-candidates'.
;;
;;  The first and second of these are regexps that candidates must
;;  match and must not match, respectively, in order for them to be
;;  displayed.  The third and fourth are predicates that candidates
;;  must satisfy.  The fifth is a list of extra candidates to display.
;;  Any of the filters can be `nil', in which case it has no effect.
;;
;;  Each of these except `icicle-extra-candidates' filters not only
;;  completion candidates but also the default values passed to
;;  `completing-read' and `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-must-match-regexp' is similar to the standard
;;  variable `completion-regexp-list', except:
;;
;;  * `completion-regexp-list' is a list of regexps, not just one.
;;  * `icicle-must-match-regexp' is used after filtering using option
;;    `icicle-transform-function'.
;;
;;  Variables `icicle-must-pass-predicate' and
;;  `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate' act the same: they filter
;;  display candidates.  The former filters before the current user
;;  input is matched.  The latter filters after matching - it is
;;  applied only to candidates that match.
;;
;;  Neither is like the PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' in
;;  that they do not act on full candidates (e.g. alist entries) -
;;  they apply only to display candidates (strings).
;;
;;  For apropos completion, the `completing-read' PREDICATE is applied
;;  to all COLLECTION entries before matching those entries that
;;  satisfy it against the user input.  If the PREDICATE argument uses
;;  only the candidate name (it does not make any use of the full
;;  candidate) then it can sometimes be more efficient to pass `nil'
;;  as the PREDICATE and use `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate'
;;  instead.
;;
;;  Here is something to keep in mind about
;;  `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate':
;;
;;  It is often a good idea to use this predicate rather than pass a
;;  PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' or `read-file-name',
;;  especially when the initial domain of candidates is large and the
;;  predicate is complex (costly).  It makes little sense to test each
;;  such candidate using the predicate, rather than test only those
;;  that match the current minibuffer input.
;;
;;  However, sometimes the PREDICATE argument to `completing-read' or
;;  `read-file-name', is also used for something else, and in such a
;;  context you will need to provide it.  In particular, Icomplete
;;  mode uses it to compute the completions it displays.
;;
;;  For this reason, the Icicles predefined functions that use
;;  `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate' also test for
;;  `icomplete-mode'.  When that is turned on they use a PREDICATE
;;  argument instead of `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate'.  You
;;  might want to do the same in your code.  Just look at the Icicles
;;  code for examples.
;;
;;  An example of this is `M-x', which by default in Icicle mode is
;;  `icicle-execute-extended-command'.  If Icomplete mode is turned on
;;  then the predicate `commandp' first filters all of the available
;;  symbols, before you type any input to be matched.  If Icomplete
;;  mode is off, then this predicate is used as
;;  `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate':
;;
;;   (lambda (c)
;;     (unless (symbolp c) (setq c  (intern-soft c)))
;;     (commandp c))
;;
;;  That does about the same thing as `commandp', but its argument is
;;  a completion candidate as displayed, that is, a string, not a
;;  symbol in the `obarray'.  See
;;  (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Expanded-Common-Match Completion").
;;
;;  And here's a gotcha to keep in mind if you use either
;;  `icicle-must-pass-predicate' or
;;  `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate' with (non-absolute)
;;  file-name candidates: Since the candidate file names have no
;;  directory part, in many cases you will want to test the candidate
;;  expanded relative to the directory shown in the minibuffer.  One
;;  way to do this is as follows:
;;
;;   (setq file  (expand-file-name file
;;                (icicle-file-name-directory-w-default
;;                  (icicle-input-from-minibuffer))))
;;
;;  This gotcha is nothing new - the same applies for standard Emacs
;;  function `read-file-name', but it is still worth pointing out.
;;
;;  Variable `icicle-extra-candidates' is not really a "filter".  It
;;  does not restrict the set of possible candidates - rather, it
;;  extends that set.  The other filters do not act on the candidates
;;  in `icicle-extra-candidates' - they are always added.  Extra
;;  candidates are displayed in buffer `*Completions*' using face
;;  `icicle-extra-candidate'.
;;
;;  Note that an extra candidate need not have anything in common with
;;  the normal (non-extra) candidates.  In particular, because it is
;;  provided explicitly, it does not follow the restrictions implied
;;  by the current candidate-generation method.  
;;
;;  In this, extra candidates are similar to proxy candidates.  For
;;  example, when option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-`nil',
;;  the proxy shell-command candidates provided have no connection
;;  with the file-name completion that is used to generate the other
;;  candidates (see (@* "Icicles Shell-Command Enhancements")).
;;
;;  Note too that if an extra candidate is already a candidate anyway
;;  then it will be present twice in the list of all candidates (that
;;  is, unless `icicle-transform-function' removes duplicate
;;  candidates).
;;
;;  These global variables are internal variables, even though they
;;  are defined as user options - they are not really meant to be
;;  customized.  If you are not an Emacs-Lisp programmer, you will not
;;  use these variables, but some commands that you use might provide
;;  corresponding global-filter user options.  Icicles provides
;;  customizable user options for Icicles buffer commands, such as
;;  `icicle-buffer'.  For example:
;;
;;    `icicle-buffer-match-regexp'    - Regexp buffer names must match
;;    `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp' - Regexp buffers must not match
;;    `icicle-buffer-predicate'       - Predicate buffers must satisfy
;;    `icicle-buffer-extras'          - Extra buffer names to display
;;
;;  You might, for instance, customize `icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'
;;  to not display file-buffers whose names end in `.elc', and
;;  customize `icicle-buffer-predicate' to show only buffers that are
;;  associated with files.  The former would use a value of "\\.elc$",
;;  and the latter would use a value such as this:
;;
;;     (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
;;
;;  Similarly, Icicles provides user options for filtering and sorting
;;  file names during completion:
;;
;;    `icicle-file-match-regexp'    - Regexp file names must match
;;    `icicle-file-no-match-regexp' - Regexp file names must not match
;;    `icicle-file-predicate'       - Predicate files must satisfy
;;    `icicle-file-extras'          - Extra file names to display
;;
;;  Note that `icicle-buffer-predicate' and `icicle-file-predicate'
;;  correspond to `icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate', not to
;;  `icicle-must-pass-predicate'.  They are applied after your current
;;  input filters the candidates.
;;
;;  If you as a programmer write a command, and you want to expose
;;  global filters to users of the command, you should:
;;
;;  1. Create corresponding user options that can be customized.
;;  2. Bind the user options to the corresponding filtering variables.
;;
;;  If you use `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command'
;;  to define a command (recommended), then you can simply pass the
;;  filter-variable bindings as part of the BINDINGS argument.
;;
;;  For convenience you can use macros `icicle-buffer-bindings' and
;;  `icicle-file-bindings' to provide bindings that are appropriate
;;  for buffer-name and file-name completion, respectively.  For
;;  example, macro `icicle-buffer-bindings' expands to include these
;;  bindings, among others:
;;
;;   (icicle-must-match-regexp             icicle-buffer-match-regexp)
;;   (icicle-must-not-match-regexp      icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp)
;;   (icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate  icicle-buffer-predicate)
;;   (icicle-require-match-flag      icicle-buffer-require-match-flag)
;;   (icicle-extra-candidates                    icicle-buffer-extras)
;;   (icicle-delete-candidate-object            'icicle-kill-a-buffer)
;;
;;  As an example of using this macro, here is the core definition of
;;  `icicle-buffer':
;;
;;   (icicle-define-command
;;    icicle-buffer                          ; Command name
;;    "Switch to a different buffer."        ; Doc string
;;    switch-to-buffer                       ; Action function
;;    "Switch to buffer: "                   ; `completing-read' args
;;    (mapcar (lambda (buf) (list (buffer-name buf))) (buffer-list))
;;    nil nil nil 'buffer-name-history
;;    (icicle-default-buffer-names current-prefix-arg) nil
;;    ;; Filter bindings
;;    (icicle-buffer-bindings))       ; Macro provides buffer bindings
;;
;;  If you define a command that uses completion, but you do not use
;;  `icicle-define-command' or `icicle-define-file-command', then you
;;  can just bind appropriate variables individually around a call to
;;  `completing-read' or `read-file-name'.
;;
;;  Another way that users can apply predicates to completion
;;  candidates is to use `M-&' while completing.  These predicates
;;  apply to the full alist-entry candidates that are supplied to
;;  `completing-read' or `read-file-name', not just to the textual
;;  candidates that are displayed in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;  See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "`M-&': Satisfying Additional Predicates").
 
;;(@* "Specifying Match Functions for Commands")
;;
;;  Defining Commands that Use Specific Match Functions
;;  ---------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  By default, Icicles lets users use vanilla prefix completion (with
;;  `TAB') or apropos completion (with `S-TAB'). They can
;;  alternatively use other completion methods with `TAB' and `S-TAB':
;;
;;  * They can use `C-(' during completion to cycle among `TAB'
;;    completion methods.
;;
;;  * They can use `M-(' to cycle among `S-TAB' completion
;;    methods.
;;
;;  * They can customize options `icicle-TAB-completion-methods-alist'
;;    and `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist', to define the
;;    completion methods among which they can cycle.
;;
;;  When you define an Icicles command, you can specify which
;;  string-matching functions the command uses during completion:
;;
;;  * If you want the command to use fuzzy completion for `TAB' by
;;    default, then bind `icicle-fuzzy-completion-flag' to
;;    non-`nil'. Users can still use `C-(' to toggle fuzzy completion
;;    off.
;;
;;  * If you want the command to use a particular string-matching
;;    function for `S-TAB' completion by default, then bind variable
;;    `icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn' to that function. Users can
;;    still use `M-(' to cycle among the other matching functions for
;;    `S-TAB'.
;;
;;  You can bind `icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn' to any function
;;  that matches strings.  You will probably also want to ensure that
;;  it is available for `M-(' cycling, by adding it to
;;  `icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist' in a `let' binding.  For
;;  example, to use matching function `my-match' in `my-cmd', you
;;  might do this:
;;
;;  (defun my-cmd ()
;;    "..."
;;    (interactive)
;;    (let ((icicle-apropos-complete-match-fn  'my-match)
;;          (icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist
;;           (cons (cons "mine" 'my-match)

;;(@* "Defining Buffer-Text Completion for Comint Modes")
;;
;;  Defining Buffer-Text Completion for Comint Modes
;;  ------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  This section is for Emacs-Lisp programmers.
;;
;;  Out of the box, Icicles provides completion for buffer text in
;;  some contexts.  This includes Shell mode, for example.  Whenever
;;  there are two or more candidate completions, you can use Icicles
;;  completion, with all of its features (cycling, progressive
;;  completion, apropos completion, and so on).
;;  See (@> "Completion in Comint Modes").
;;
;;  Shell mode is an example of a mode that inherits from Comint mode.
;;  Other libraries sometimes define modes that also extend Comint
;;  mode in different ways.  Library ESS does so, for example.
;;
;;  In such modes, the top-level completion command used is typically
;;  `comint-dynamic-complete', and it is typically bound to `TAB'.  In
;;  Icicle mode, `TAB' in such a buffer is instead bound to the
;;  Icicles version of this command, `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete'.
;;
;;  Icicles provides the infrastructure for you to take advantage of
;;  Icicles completion with your own modes that inherit from Comint
;;  mode.  For that, just do the following:
;;
;;  1. Define replacement functions for the functions that perform the
;;     completion.  The functions to be replaced themselves typically
;;     call a Comint completion function, such as
;;     `comint-dynamic-complete-filename'.  You can typically use the
;;     same definitions as the original functions, except replace the
;;     call to a function that displays multiple matching candidates
;;     by a call to a corresponding Icicles function that performs
;;     completion.
;;
;;  2. Customize option `icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements',
;;     adding the mappings that specify which standard functions to
;;     replace with your completion functions (from #1).  Take a look
;;     at the default value of this option to see what I mean.
;;
;;  3. Use `eval-after-load' to toggle Icicle mode when the vanilla
;;     code for your mode is loaded, to ensure that the original
;;     definitions are picked up.  See the end of `icicles-mode.el'
;;     for an example of this.
;;
;;  If you are interested in trying this, take a look at the Icicles
;;  code for, say, `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-command', comparing
;;  it with the original code for `shell-dynamic-complete-command'.
;;  You will see that the only change is to substitute a call to
;;  `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-as-command' for a call to
;;  `shell-dynamic-complete-as-command'.  Likewise,
;;  `icicle-shell-dynamic-complete-as-command' is a trivial alteration
;;  of `shell-dynamic-complete-as-command'.
;;
;;  The key is to ultimately call an Icicles completion command, such
;;  as `icicle-comint-dynamic-simple-complete', whenever there are
;;  multiple completion candidates.  This has the effect of using
;;  Icicles minibuffer completion instead of simply displaying the
;;  alternatives in buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  Icicles uses this same technique, of substituting Icicles
;;  completion for simple display of alternatives, for all buffer-text
;;  completion that it supports out of the box, even when there is no
;;  relation with Comint mode.
 
;;(@* "Note to Programmers")
;;
;;  Note to Programmers
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  Here are some simple guidelines for using Icicles in Emacs-Lisp
;;  programming:
;;
;;  1. *Use it*!  Even if you do not do anything else, include this in
;;     your library:
;;
;;     (require 'icicles nil t)
;;
;;     That has absolutely no consequences if Icicles is not present
;;     in the user's `load-path' (there is no load error).  If Icicles
;;     is present, however, then users can take advantage of each use
;;     you make of `completing-read' and `read-file-name' in your
;;     code.
;;
;;  2. Use an input-completion read function, such as
;;     `completing-read' or `read-file-name', when you read input!
;;     There is almost never a reason not to use an input-completion
;;     function when reading user input - especially considering that
;;     you need not always provide a REQUIRE-MATCH argument.
;;
;;     Try also to find an appropriate PREDICATE argument, and a good
;;     set of default values to pass to `completing-read' as its
;;     COLLECTION argument.  Too often, I think, we use an overly
;;     general COLLECTION argument, such as the `obarray', and we do
;;     not provide a (good) PREDICATE.  Using an input-completion
;;     function with an appropriate candidate completion list and
;;     predicate can help users considerably.
;;
;;     If you want to also give users a way to customize a (different)
;;     predicate that applies only to the textual candidates that are
;;     displayed in buffer `*Completions*', as opposed to the full
;;     alist-entry candidates that are supplied to `completing-read'
;;     or `read-file-name', then you can define a new user option and
;;     then bind internal variable `icicle-must-pass-predicate' to the
;;     value of that option. See (@> "Global Filters").
;;
;;  3. Avoid using a literal-string `interactive' spec (e.g.
;;     (interactive "fFile: ")) that reads input with completion.
;;     Instead, call `completing-read' or `read-file-name' within the
;;     `interactive' spec.  This saves Icicles users of progressive
;;     completion the need to hit `RET' multiple times to pass their
;;     input up through multiple levels of recursive minibuffers to
;;     the top level.  See
;;     (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Progressive Completion").
;;
;;  4. In many cases, it makes sense to define a multi-command, rather
;;     than a simple command.  People can always use a multi-command
;;     as a simple command, but not vice versa.
;;     See (@file :file-name "icicles-doc1.el" :to "Multi-Commands"),
;;     (@> "Defining Icicles Commands (Including Multi-Commands)"),
;;     and (@> "Defining Multi-Commands the Hard Way").
;;
;;  5. Consider using `icicle-completing-read-history' instead of
;;     `read-from-minibuffer' or `read-string' for most purposes.
;;     This lets users complete their input against previously entered
;;     input.  Completion is lax, so they can also enter new input.
;;
;;  6. You can bind `icicle-sort-comparer' temporarily to any sort
;;     function you need.
;;
;;  7. Function `icicle-next-candidate' is a general framework for
;;     letting users cycle completions of partial input strings.  I
;;     use it to define the cycling behavior for both prefix and
;;     apropos completions.  You can use it to easily define other,
;;     application-specific input matching/completion/cycling
;;     behavior.  Just supply it with a function that takes the
;;     current partial user input (a string) and returns a list of
;;     candidate completions, however those might be defined.
;;
;;  8. If the potential number of completion candidates is enormous,
;;     then icompletion display in `*Completions*' can be slow.  In
;;     that case, consider turning it off for the duration of the
;;     command, by binding `icicle-incremental-completion' to `nil'.
;;     An alternative to turning it off is the approach taken in
;;     Icicles (e.g. `icicle-vardoc' and
;;     `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'): Just add a reminder to the
;;     doc string to tell users that they can cycle
;;     `icicle-incremental-completion' using `C-#'.
;;
;;  9. Yes, you can define commands that do or do not use Icicles.
;;     That is, users can take advantage of Icicles behavior during
;;     particular commands, even while in general leaving Icicle mode
;;     off.  Conversely, they can get vanilla Emacs behavior while in
;;     general leaving Icicle mode on.
;;
;;     When you define a command, you can use macro
;;     `icicle-with-icy-mode-ON' to enable Icicle mode during the
;;     evaluation of its body sexps.  The original value of Icicle
;;     mode (on or off) is restored when done.  If Icicle mode was
;;     already on then enabling it is skipped (a no-op).
;;
;;     Similarly, you can use macro `icicle-with-icy-mode-OFF' to
;;     disable Icicle mode during the evaluation of its body sexps.
;;     The original value of Icicle mode (on or off) is restored when
;;     done.  If Icicle mode was already off then disabling it is
;;     skipped (a no-op).
;;
;; 10. Another of my libraries that can help programmers provide
;;     default values is `thingatpt+.el'.  It provides functions for
;;     picking up symbols, sexps, numbers, words, and other sorts of
;;     thing near the text cursor (`point').

;;
;;  1. This library started life as `elect-mbuf.el', by Hans Koomen.

;;    Subject: elect-mbuf.el
;;    Date: Tue, 13 Jun 89 15:17:07 -0400
;;
;;  2. I hacked and enhanced the library in various relatively minor
;;  ways over the years, maintaining it as `elect-mbuf.el' - see
;;  details in file `icicles-chg.el'.
;;
;;  I did not change the main functionality of the library during this
;;  period: it always cycled the COMPLETE list of (basic prefix)
;;  completion candidates passed to `completing-read'; it did not
;;  update the candidate list based on the current minibuffer
;;  contents.
;;
;;  So, for instance, if you had `M-x for' in the minibuffer, `down'
;;  would cycle among ALL Emacs commands, not just those that start
;;  with "for".  I used the library this way for fifteen years without
;;  thinking much about this behavior or the code behind it.
;;
;;  3. In July 2005, Lennart Borgman gave `elect-mbuf.el' a quick try,
;;  and intuitively expected to see behavior along the lines that you
;;  see now for Icicles basic prefix completion:
;;
;;  a. `down' should cycle completions relative to the current input,
;;     not all completions supplied to `completing-read'.
;;  b. If buffer `*Completions*' is displayed, `down' should highlight
;;     the current candidate there.
;;
;;  Good idea Lennart (<lennart.borgman.073@student.lu.se>).  So I
;;  implemented that behavior, and renamed the library "Icicles" (for,
;;  I suppose, "input cycles" or some such - or because it's "cool").
;;
;;  4. The code changes I made to implement #3 (completion cycling
;;  relative to current input) made me realize that other completion
;;  matchings could be implemented in a similar way.  Basic prefix
;;  completion (the only completion provided by Emacs at the time) is
;;  handy, but it is also sometimes a bit limited.  The idea of
;;  apropos completion occurred to me, and I implemented that as well.
;;
;;  5. I extended the library quite a bit more, in terms of
;;  convenience (highlighting, treatment of buffer
;;  `*Completions*',..., but also in terms of functionality.  In
;;  particular, it now treats file names too.  And, because Emacs 21
;;  and later versions use `read-file-name' for `find-file' and so on,
;;  Icicles now treats `read-file-name' the same as `completing-read'.
;;
;;  6. On another suggestion from LennartBorgman, I made Icicles take
;;  advantage of Delete Selection mode.  And I implemented it as a
;;  minor mode.
;;
;;  7, 8, 9,...  One thing has led to another, and I've just kept
;;  adding features.  Feature creep, I guess.  But the more I play
;;  with Icicles, the more I imagine new ways it might be made more
;;  useful.

;;  Note on Non-`nil' `pop-up-frames' on MS Windows
;;  -----------------------------------------------
;;
;;  If you use `pop-up-frames' = `t', like I do, you might have
;;  noticed that Emacs completion does not play well with using
;;  separate frames for each buffer.  In particular, it does not play
;;  well with having a separate frame for buffer `*Completions*'.
;;  When you try to complete input using `TAB', a new frame is created
;;  for buffer `*Completions*', and, at least on MS Windows, it is
;;  selected, taking the input focus away from the original frame's
;;  minibuffer!
;;
;;  This means that, once the `*Completions*' buffer has been
;;  displayed in a separate frame, you cannot, for instance, cycle
;;  completion candidates, without first reselecting the original
;;  frame manually.  You cannot even use normal completion - you
;;  cannot add text in the minibuffer, or delete text there, because
;;  the minibuffer in the original frame no longer has the input
;;  focus.  Bummer.
;;
;;  In general, Emacs does not play too well with one-buffer-per-frame
;;  (`pop-up-frames' = `t'), and this is a good example of that
;;  general problem.
;;
;;  I reported this Emacs bug.  I've been hoping it will be corrected
;;  since Emacs 21...
;;
;;  I do not have this problem of loss of frame input focus in my own
;;  setup, even though I use `pop-up-frames' = `t', because I use my
;;  library `oneonone.el'.  (Try it!)  If you need a solution while
;;  waiting for the Emacs fix, you can try doing something similar to
;;  what I do in `oneonone.el':
;;
;;  1. Use dedicated frames for both `*Completions*' and the
;;     minibuffer.
;;
;;  2. Display buffer `*Completions*' using a special-display function
;;     that explicitly redirects the input focus from the
;;     `*Completions*' frame back to the minibuffer frame.
