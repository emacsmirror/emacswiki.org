The Shimbun module is a library set of [[emacs-w3m]] that enables you to read
certain web contents using Gnus, Wanderlust, or Mew as if they were
email messages. Shimbun means a newspaper in Japanese.

You will need to install the following packages, before installing emacs-w3m:

* [[FLIM]] (ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/)
* [[APEL]] (ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/)

: ftp.m17n.org doesn't seem to allow anonymous access at the moment. Development versions of FLIM and APEL for Wanderlust are available at:
: * https://github.com/wanderlust/flim
: * https://github.com/wanderlust/apel

: You could also try these alternatives:
: * ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/apel/
: * http://www.kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tomo/lemi/dist/flim/

Note that, with my config Emacs 21.3, I had to remove the smtp.el and
smtpmail.el files that comes with FLIM as they override the files that
comes with emacs.

I had to delete some more files from FLIM and APEL. Just use M-x list-load-path-shadows to find packages from FLIM and APEL that shadow other more recent files. (StefanReichoer)

To add a group to gnus simply put

    (autoload 'gnus-group-make-shimbun-group "nnshimbun" nil t) 

in your .gnus and use M-x gnus-group-make-shimbun-group RET asahi RET
national RET (asahi and national are examples, you can use completion to
see the list of server).

Originally, the defined servers were Japanese servers, but there are a
growing number of English language news sources as well (The New York
Times, the BBC, The Register, etc.). The library allows to create a
new server definition based on an existing server class. For instance
there are classes for mhonarc archive, geocrawler.com ...

=== EmacsWiki ===

==== Simple Version ====

Because EmacsWiki has a good user interface and a RSS Feed it's quite
easy to write a shimbun.  This approach takes the URL from the RSS feed
and strips the header and footer:

    ;; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    ;; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    ;; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
    ;; any later version.
    
    (require 'shimbun)
    (require 'sb-rss)
    
    (luna-define-class shimbun-emacswiki (shimbun-rss) ())
    
    (defvar shimbun-emacswiki-url
      "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=rss")
    (defvar shimbun-emacswiki-groups '("changes"))
    (defvar shimbun-emacswiki-from-address  "invalid@emacswiki.org")
    (defvar shimbun-emacswiki-content-start "<h1>")
    (defvar shimbun-emacswiki-content-end "<div class=\"footer\">")
    
    (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-emacswiki))
      shimbun-emacswiki-url)
    
    (luna-define-method shimbun-rss-build-message-id
      ((shimbun shimbun-emacswiki) url date)
      (unless (string-match "id=\\(.*?\\);revision=\\([0-9]+\\)" url)
        (error "Cannot find message-id base"))
      (concat "<" (match-string 1 url) (match-string 2 url) "@emacswiki.org>"))
    
    (provide 'sb-emacswiki)

To get it work put the file in e.g. <tt>~/.elisp/</tt> and add 

    (setq shimbun-server-additional-path '("~/.elisp"))

to your <tt>~/.emacs</tt>,

This code is posted mainly for ''educational'' reasons ;-) to show how
easy it is to write your own shimbun.  Read on for an improved version.

==== Showing the diff Page ====

This EmacsWiki shimbun overwrites the <tt>`shimbun-get-headers'</tt>
method to modify the URL.  Instead of a specific revision it fetches
the page showing the differences to the previous revision.

This Shimbun is now part of the emacs-w3m CVS repository.

* http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-emacswiki.el?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain

If you don't update you news reader often enough and fear to miss some
topics you can set <tt>shimbun-emacswiki-url</tt> to get a RSS Feed
with more items:

     (setq shimbun-emacswiki-url "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=rss&days=15&rsslimit=all&all=1")

See GnusRss for details.

=== Heise Online ===

There's Shimbun for the popular German (tech) news site
heise online.  It supports

* the newsticker http://www.heise.de/newsticker/
* and telepolis http://www.heise.de/tp/

This Shimbun is now part of the emacs-w3m CVS repository.

* http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-heise.el?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain 

=== Spiegel Online ===

Here's another German shimbun.  Read the mainstream news site
http://www.spiegel.de/ without the html annoyances.

This Shimbun is now part of the emacs-w3m CVS repository.

* http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-spiegel.el?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain

=== More german news ===

I got conditioned by the above two shimbun backends and built some
more on top of the rss feeds I have been reading anyway. The more
complete and stable of them found their way into emacs-w3m CVS.

* A German TV station: http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-n24-de.el?rev=HEAD
* This feed seems to be directly forwarded from a German press agency, the traffic is quite high: http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-welt-de.el?rev=HEAD
* Some teaser articles of one of the better german newspapers: http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-zeit-de.el?rev=HEAD
* Music news and reviews in German: http://cvs.namazu.org/*checkout*/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-laut-de.el?rev=HEAD

=== RSS and Atom Feeds ==

While there is great power in writing your own shimbun, the
development version of emacs-w3m comes with "generic" shimbun
that parse rss and atom feeds:

* rss-hash.el: http://cvs.namazu.org/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-rss-hash.el?rev=HEAD
* atom-hash.el: http://cvs.namazu.org/emacs-w3m/shimbun/sb-atom-hash.el?rev=HEAD

You can add feeds for reading in [[Gnus]], [[Wanderlust]], and [[Mew]]
by using the variables shimbun-rss-hash-group-path-alist and
shimbun-atom-hash-group-path-alist.

There is also a module rss-blogs.el that will display the full text of
articles for blogs that do not publish the full text in a feed. This
shimbun module performs automatic html filtering on Wordpress,
Blogger, and TypePad Blogs. Or, one can specify regular expressions
that mark the beginning and end of the content.
