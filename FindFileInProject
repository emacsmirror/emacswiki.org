This library provides a couple methods for quickly finding any file
in a given project. It depends on GNU find.

A project is found by searching up the directory tree until a file
is found that matches `ffip-project-file'. (".git/.svn/.hg" by default.)
By default, it looks only for files whose names match
`ffip-patterns',

If you have so many files that it becomes unwieldy, you can set
`ffip-find-options' to a string which will be passed to the `find'
invocation in order to exclude irrelevant subdirectories. For
instance, in a Ruby on Rails project, you may be interested in all
.rb files that don't exist in the "vendor" directory. In that case
you could set `ffip-find-options' to "-not -regex \".*vendor.*\"".

All these variables may be overridden on a per-directory basis in
your .dir-locals.el.  See [[Manual:Directory Variables]] for
details.
