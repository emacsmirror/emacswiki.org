==Overview==

Persistent storage for Emacs, returning nil on failure.

This is a (trivial) wrapper around pcache.el, providing "soft"
fetch and store routines which never throw an error.

==Availability==

The library is available at github:

: https://github.com/rolandwalker/persistent-soft

and via <nowiki>EmacsWiki</nowiki>:

: Lisp:persistent-soft.el

==Compatibility and Requirements==

Tested only on GNU Emacs version 24.1

Uses if present: [https://github.com/sigma/pcache pcache.el] (all operations are noops
when pcache.el is not present)
