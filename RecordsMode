XavierMaillard is the current maintainer of records starting at 1.5.1 "redux"
release (see https://launchpad.net/records/1.5/1.5.2)

This release adds no new feature except it is likely it will build successfully now. Please test and report any bug on the launchpad project.

Currently, it is broken with recent emacs version. Please allow some time for me to fix this.
