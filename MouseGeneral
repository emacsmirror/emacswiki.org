Emacs has long supported the [[WikiPedia:Mouse|mouse]] under window systems like X and Microsoft's.  Touchpads and trackballs and such are also considered mice by Emacs.

If you are completely new to Emacs and/or the mouse, see EmacsNewbieMouseReference for a gentle introduction.

== Intermediate techniques ==

* CopyingWholeLines -- Use the mouse to copy lines.
* DragAndDrop -- how to control what happens when you drag stuff into Emacs
* GrabAndDrag -- Scroll a window by mouse dragging
* SecondarySelection -- A second selection (like a second [[region]]).  You can create, copy, cut, and paste it using the mouse, the same way you manipulate the region.

There is also the concept of the `mouse-face' property -- a [[text property]] whose value is a [[face]] (font/color/etc) that is seen only when the mouse is "hovered" over text with that property. When the `mouse-face' is shown, faces used for the normal `face' text property are not shown. Typically, `mouse-face' highlighting indicates that clicking the mouse on the highlighted text will perform an action that is different from clicking it elsewhere.  Hypertext links are often highlighted using property `mouse-face'.

== Adjusting mouse behavior==

* MouseBindingNotation -- Naming mouse buttons and changing what they do
* MouseBindings -- The functions bound to the mouse in a default Emacs
* PointerShape -- Change the shape of the [[pointer]].
* MouseAvoidance -- Automatically move the pointer out of your way.
* MouseCopy -- Single-click copy/yank to point


=== Quickies ===

Right-click always pops up menu (not the region/kill stuff):

    (global-set-key [mouse-3] 'mouse-popup-menubar-stuff)

Middle-click pastes at point (text cursor location), not where clicked (as for xterm, even if running GUI):

    (setq mouse-yank-at-point t)

Focus-follows-mouse (point-to-focus) for internal Emacs windows.  Argument is delay in seconds.

    (setq mouse-autoselect-window 0.25)

== Disabling the mouse ==

The [https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el inhibit-mouse] Emacs package allows disabling of mouse input for users who wish to prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that can alter the cursor position unexpectedly. It can also be useful reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow.

== Mouse-specific modes and extensions ==

These are centered around using or extending the mouse; they are useless without the mouse.

* The [https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el inhibit-mouse] package allows the disabling of mouse input. 
* StrokeMode -- Hand-drawn patterns to insert characters or execute commands
* ArtistMode -- Draw freehand with the mouse
* <tt>[[follow-mouse.el]]</tt> -- Make the [[frame]] focus follow the pointer
* [[Mouse3]] -- Customize how `mouse-3' behaves.  Context-sensitive menus.
* [[Mouse+]] -- Highlight the position where the mouse will paste, until you release the mouse button. Lets you correct your aim. Also: use `mouse-2' in the [[echo area]] to initiate `M-x'.
* MouseEvent -- Write mouse-event code compatible with different EmacsLisp dialects
* [[DelicateMouseClick]] -- Place point on the side (left/right) of the character where you click

== Mouse-supporting extensions ==

These are not specific to the mouse, but have significant features which can make use of the mouse.

* HighLight -- Apply mouse-over (`mouse-face') highlighting to text.
* DiredPlus -- Use the mouse to mark files, including in ways similar to Windows Explorer.
* DoReMi -- Use the mouse wheel to repeat commands, run commands in sequence, increment things, or cycle through enumerations.
