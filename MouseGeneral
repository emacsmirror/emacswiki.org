Emacs has long supported the [[WikiPedia:Mouse|mouse]] under window systems like X and Microsoft's.  Touchpads and trackballs and such are also considered mice by Emacs.

If you are completely new to Emacs and/or the mouse, see EmacsNewbieMouseReference for a gentle introduction.

== Intermediate techniques ==

* CopyingWholeLines -- Use the mouse to copy lines.
* DragAndDrop -- how to control what happens when you drag stuff into Emacs
* GrabAndDrag -- Scroll a window by mouse dragging
* SecondarySelection -- A second selection (like a second [[region]]).  You can create, copy, cut, and paste it using the mouse, the same way you manipulate the region.

There is also the concept of the `mouse-face' property -- a [[text property]] whose value is a [[face]] (font/color/etc) that is seen only when the mouse is "hovered" over text with that property. When the `mouse-face' is shown, faces used for the normal `face' text property are not shown. Typically, `mouse-face' highlighting indicates that clicking the mouse on the highlighted text will perform an action that is different from clicking it elsewhere.  Hypertext links are often highlighted using property `mouse-face'.

== Adjusting mouse behavior==

* MouseBindingNotation -- Naming mouse buttons and changing what they do
* MouseBindings -- The functions bound to the mouse in a default Emacs
* PointerShape -- Change the shape of the [[pointer]].
* MouseAvoidance -- Automatically move the pointer out of your way.
* MouseCopy -- Single-click copy/yank to point
* [[DelicateMouseClick]] -- Placement point on the side (left/right) of the character clicked upon

=== Quickies ===

Right-click always pops up menu (not the region/kill stuff):

    (global-set-key [mouse-3] 'mouse-popup-menubar-stuff)

Middle-click pastes at point (text cursor location), not where clicked (as for xterm, even if running GUI):

    (setq mouse-yank-at-point t)

Focus-follows-mouse (point-to-focus) for internal Emacs windows.  Argument is delay in seconds.

    (setq mouse-autoselect-window 0.25)

== Mouse-specific modes and extensions ==

These are centered around using or extending the mouse; they are useless without the mouse.

* StrokeMode -- Hand-drawn patterns to insert characters or execute commands
* ArtistMode -- Draw freehand with the mouse
* <tt>[[follow-mouse.el]]</tt> -- Make the [[frame]] focus follow the pointer
* [[Mouse3]] -- Customize how `mouse-3' behaves.  Context-sensitive menus.
* [[Mouse+]] -- Highlight the position where the mouse will paste, until you release the mouse button. Lets you correct your aim. Also: use `mouse-2' in the [[echo area]] to initiate `M-x'.
* MouseEvent -- Write mouse-event code compatible with different EmacsLisp dialects

== Mouse-supporting extensions ==

These are not specific to the mouse, but have significant features which can make use of the mouse.

* HighLight -- Apply mouse-over (`mouse-face') highlighting to text.
* DiredPlus -- Use the mouse to mark files, including in ways similar to Windows Explorer.
* DoReMi -- Use the mouse wheel to repeat commands, run commands in sequence, increment things, or cycle through enumerations.
