Org mode lets you organize your tasks.  However, sometimes you may wish to integrate org-mode with outlook since your company *forces* you to use Microsoft Outlook.  Lisp:org-outlook.el allows:

* Creating Tasks from outlook items:
** org-outlook-task.  All selected items in outlook will be added to a task-list at curernt point.  Requires [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?task.vbs task.vbs]
* Create Link from outlook items:
** org-outlook-copy.  Single selected item in outlook will be added to org-file at current point.  Requires [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?guid.vbs guid.vbs]
* Open Outlook Links in org-mode
** Requires org-outlook-location to be customized when using Outlook 2007 (this way you don't have to edit the registry).
 
This is based loosely on: http://superuser.com/questions/71786/can-i-create-a-link-to-a-specific-email-message-in-outlook 


Note that you may also add tasks using visual basic directly.  The script below performs the following actions:
* Move email to Personal Folders under folder "@ActionTasks" (changes GUID)
* Create a org-mode task under heading "* Tasks" for the file "f: \Documents\org\gtd.org"
* Note by replacing "@ActionTasks", "* Tasks" and "f: \Documents\org\gtd.org" you can modify this script to your personal needs.

The visual basic script for outlook is:

<pre>
Sub CreateTaskFromItem()
    Dim T As Variant
    Dim Outlook As New Outlook.Application
    Dim orgfile As Variant
    Dim Pos As Integer
    Dim taskf As Object
    
    Set myNamespace = Outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")
    Set myPersonalFolder = myNamespace.Folders.item("Personal Folders")
    Set allPersonalFolders = myPersonalFolder.Folders
    
    T = ""
    For Each Folder In allPersonalFolders
        If Folder.Name = "@ActionTasks" Then
            Set taskf = Folder
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
    
    If Outlook.Application.ActiveExplorer.Selection.Count > 0 Then
        For I = 1 To Outlook.Application.ActiveExplorer.Selection.Count
                Set objMail = Outlook.ActiveExplorer.Selection.item(I)
                Set objMail = objMail.Move(taskf)
                objMail.Save 'Maybe this will update EntryID
                T = T + "** TODO " + objMail.Subject + " :OFFICE:" + vbCrLf
                T = T + "[[outlook:" + objMail.EntryID + "][MESSAGE: " + objMail.Subject + " (" + objMail.SenderName + ")]]"
                T = T + vbCrLf + vbCrLf
                T = T + objMail.Body
                T = T + vbCrLf + vbCrLf
        Next
        ' Now that we have the org-mode tasks, add to org-mode file
        orgfile = GetFile("f:\Documents\org\gtd.org")
        Pos = InStr(1, orgfile, "* Tasks", vbTextCompare)
        orgfile = Mid(orgfile, 1, Pos + Len("* Tasks") + 1) + vbCrLf + T + Mid(orgfile, Pos + Len("* Tasks") + 1, Len(orgfile))
        orgfile = Replace(orgfile, vbCrLf, Chr(10)) ' Change to unix line endings.
        WriteFile "f:\Documents\org\gtd.org", orgfile
    Else
        MsgBox "No Message(s) Selected"
    End If
 
End Sub
</pre>
