== Introduction: ==
Org mode lets you organize your tasks. However, sometimes you may wish
to integrate org-mode with outlook since your company forces you to
use Microsoft Outlook.  [[org-outlook.el]] allows: 

* Creating Tasks from outlook items:
* org-outlook-task. All selected items in outlook will be added to a
task-list at current point. This version requires org-protocol and   
org-protocol.vbs.  The org-protocol.vbs has can be generated with
the interactive function <tt>org-outlook-create-vbs</tt>.

* If your organization has blocked all macro access OR you want to
have an action for a saved <tt>.msg</tt> email, org-outlook also adds
drag and drop support allowing <tt>.msg</tt> files to become org tasks.
This is enabled by default, but can be disabled by <tt>org-outlook-no-dnd</tt>

* Open Outlook Links in org-mode

* Requires org-outlook-location to be customized when using Outlook
2007 (this way you don’t have to edit the registry).

This is based loosely on:
http://superuser.com/questions/71786/can-i-create-a-link-to-a-specific-email-message-in-outlook


Note that you may also add tasks using visual basic directly. The script below performs the following actions:

* Move email to Personal Folders under folder "@!ActionTasks" (changes GUID)
* Create a org-mode task under heading "* Tasks" for the file <tt>f:\Documents\org\gtd.org</tt>
* Note by replacing "@!ActionTasks", "* Tasks" and
<tt>f:\Documents\org\gtd.org</tt> you can modify this script to your
personal needs.

The visual basic script for outlook can be created by calling <tt>M-x org-outlook-create-vbs</tt>
