This small hack makes the Thinkpad light blink twice whenever the nickname is mentioned in a non-visible buffer. To take full advantage of it when not in Emacs it is better to change to some non-IRC buffer, since it will not signal the activity if the buffer is visible, even if the Emacs frame isn't.

It depends on the ibm-acpi (thinkpad-acpi in version 2.6.22 and above) to provide the "/proc/acpi/ibm/light" interface, which makes it Linux-specific.
