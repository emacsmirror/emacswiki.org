I started using Emacs since early 2016. I use GNU/Emacs, MicroEmacs Jasspa Distribution and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/sciteco/ SciTECO] (a modern real time display TECO dialect) on macOS.

You might want to contact me at mailto:andpuke@foxmail.com

Of course LdBeth is not my real name.

Since my homepage is under reconstruction, it isn't available here.

Happy Hacking!

== Packages I use ==

# WanderLust and NotMuch for e-mail
# Gnus for news
# MuseMode and PlannerMode for blogging and writing
# WThreeM and Conkeror for browsing web.
# Erc for IRC
