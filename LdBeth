I started using Emacs since early 2016. I use GNU/Emacs, MicroEmacs Jasspa Distribution and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/sciteco/ SciTECO] (a modern real time display TECO dialect) on macOS and NetBSD.

You might want to contact me at mailto:andpuke@foxmail.com

Of course LdBeth is not my real name.

Now I'm on sdf.org

My homepage is at [https://ldbeth.sdf.org], you may find some audio sample I made.

Happy Hacking!
