[http://arduino.cc/ Arduino] is "an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments."

The Arduino IDE is useful for beginners, but Emacs is better.

* [https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode arduino-mode.el] - major mode for editing .ino and .pde files.
* CEDET (CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools) supports Arduino sketch projects, enabling compilation and uploading sketches to your microcontroller.

To compile sketches outside of the Arduino IDE, you will need to use [http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html Arduino.mk] which is comes with the Arduino development environment.  This enables command line compilation of your sketches, and is used by the CEDET support.

Alternately, to use the Arduino IDE for compilation, but edit in Emacs, open the preferences in the IDE, and choose "Use External Editor".

== Emacs + arudino.mk - Quickstart for Linux  ==
* Add yourself to dialout group (whatever group allows access to serial port).  You will probably need to kill off emacs and re-login to have this take effect.
* Run regular arduino IDE and set up preferences to point to correct board type/serial port (arduino.mk reads this for automagically populating fields below) 
* Install arduino-mk from your repository/github
* Create simple Makefile in the same directory as your .ino file.  Contents can be as simple as this (only the include is truly necessary, all other lines can be omitted for simple sketches):
<pre>
BOARD_TAG = uno (see make show_boards)                                                                                                 
ARDUINO_LIBS = <space separated list of libs, arduino.mk will try to guess>
MONITOR_PORT = /dev/ttyUSB0 (will be automatically guessed from IDE prefs)                                                                                                     
include /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk
</pre>
* Call Makefile with M-x compile RET make -k upload

== Arduino Support for OS X ==

This is what I did in order to get Arduino support for OS X:

=== Install CEDET===

[http://cedet.sourceforge.net CEDET] is a very complex and powerful  package, but I will perform a simple installation from the bazaar repository:

<pre>
~/.emacs.d/vendor $ /opt/local/bin/bzr checkout bzr://cedet.bzr.sourceforge.net/bzrroot/cedet/code/trunk cedet
~/.emacs.d/vendor $ cd cedet
~/.emacs.d/vendor $ make EMACS=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
</pre>

or, if you are using [http://aquamacs.org/ Aquamacs], instead of using ##make## open ##~/.emacs.d/vendor/cedet/cedet-build.el## in Aquamacs then:

<pre>
M-x eval-buffer
M-x cedet-build-in-this-emacs
</pre>

Then, following the INSTALL file, add this to your emacs config file:

<pre>
;; Load CEDET.
;; See cedet/common/cedet.info for configuration details.
;; IMPORTANT: For Emacs >= 23.2, you must place this *before* any
;; CEDET component (including EIEIO) gets activated by another 
;; package (Gnus, auth-source, ...).
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/vendor/cedet/cedet-devel-load.el")

;; Add further minor-modes to be enabled by semantic-mode.
;; See doc-string of `semantic-default-submodes' for other things
;; you can use here.
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-semantic-idle-summary-mode t)
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-semantic-idle-completions-mode t)
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-cedet-m3-minor-mode t)

;; Enable Semantic
(semantic-mode 1)

;; Enable EDE (Project Management) features
(global-ede-mode 1)

;; Configure arduino OS X dirs.
(setq ede-arduino-appdir "/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java")

</pre>

You must add the last line in order to tell CEDET the path where the Arduino libraries are.
=== Install Arduino mode ===

Go to your emacs config directory and get a git copy of the [https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode Arduino-mode]:

<pre>
~/.emacs.d/vendor $ git clone git://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode.git
</pre>

Configure your emacs init file to use it:

<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/arduino")
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.\\(pde\\|ino\\)$" . arduino-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'arduino-mode "arduino-mode" "Arduino editing mode." t)
</pre> 
=== Install Arduino IDE ===

Download the [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software IDE] and move it to your Applications folder. Connect your Arduino to the USB port,
 compile the blink example, and upload it. Verify that everything works fine. After that, from a terminal shell, create a directory in your $HOME 
folder and add a link to it following this steps:

<pre>
~/ $ mkdir .arduino
~/ $ cd .arduino
~/.arduino $ ln -s /Users/yourusername/Library/Arduino/preferences.txt .
</pre>

=== Install Arduino-cli tools ===

We need this [http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html tools] in order to create the Makefile file. I downloaded them 
in my /opt/local/share dir.

<pre>
/opt/local/share $ sudo git clone git://github.com/mjoldfield/Arduino-Makefile.git
</pre>

Edit the Aduino.mk file inside the new Arduino-Makefile/arduino-mk directory. Modify and uncomment this lines 
according to your installation:

<pre>
   ARDUINO_DIR   = /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java
   ARDMK_DIR     = /opt/local/share/Arduino-Makefile
</pre>

Add a link in your ARDUINO_DIR to the Arduino.mk file:

<pre>
/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java $ ln -s
/opt/local/share/Arduino-Makefile/arduino-mk/Arduino.mk ./Arduino.mk
</pre>

=== Install required Perl modules ===

Do this as root:

<pre>
sudo /usr/bin/perl -MCPAN -e shell

.
.
.

cpan[1]> install YAML

.
.
.

cpan[2]> install Device::SerialPort
</pre>

===Test the installation ===

Open a .ino file. C-c . c will create the makefile and compile the code. C-c . U will upload it to the arduino.
If you get this error: Cannot invoke project-compile-target, try M-x  global-ede-mode.
