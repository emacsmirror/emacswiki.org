(also known as [::eludom])

Hi. I'm something of a lifer in Emacs. I've been using emacs, TECO based, since something
like 1979, mg/microemacs in the 80s and 90s, Xemacs for a spell and GNU since it
was released. I live in Northern Virginia and do a bit of hiking and bike riding.
In past lives I spent time (working) at Compuserve, AOL, Amazon/AWS, UUNET, CMU/CERT,
and Palo Alto Networks coding and doing "Cybersecurity". I will use <code>/bin/ed</code>
in a pinch.
