This program provides some interactive functions in order that we can easily request the text translation between English and Japanese to multiple Web translation services. These functions were implemented using `url-retrieve', so the responses will be displayed asynchronously in the popup window.

This program is tested on GNU Emacs 22, 23.

== Downloading ==

: Lisp:trans-ej.el

== Installation ==

First, save this file as trans-ej.el and byte-compile in a directory that is listed in load-path.

Put the following in your .emacs file:

 (require 'trans-ej)

== Usage ==

To translate the buffer text, select region you desire, and just type as:

 M-x trans-ej

Have fun!
