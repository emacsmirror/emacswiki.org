I hate Emacs put a lot of spam on the mode-line.  -- AndyStewart

==What message are we really care?==
In fact, every day we are only interested those information: column, row, percent, time and date

==Why not remove mode-line?==
Emacs intro mode-line show information of current buffer, but most of them are spam.
When you compare the file vertically, mode-line waste a lot of space and interfere with our line of sight.
If you want detail information of current buffer, `Ctrl + h m' is enough.
So why not remove mode-line ?

You can use below code to *remove* mode-line:
{{{
(custom-set-faces
  '(mode-line ((t (:background "#3E0303" :foreground "#3E0303" :height 1))))
  '(mode-line-highlight ((t (:height 1))))
  '(mode-line-inactive ((t (:background "gray10" :foreground "gray10" :height 1))))
)
}}}

==What's minibuffer-tray ?==
minibuffer-tray just contain  necessary information (column, row, percent, time, date)
and stay on the bottom right corner of the emacs.

Most graphics feature of minibuffer-tray is provide by PyQt5 program [https://gitcafe.com/Deepin/deepin-emacs/tree/master/site-lisp/extensions/minibuffer-tray/minibuffer_tray.py minibuffer_tray.py], i use DBus as process communication between Emacs and PyQt5 process, emacs report status to PyQt5 program to render.

==Why use PyQt5?==
Because hacking emacs minibuffer is hard work and i will maintain monkey patch to move information from mode-line to minibuffer right corner since most emacser use mode-line all the time.

PyQt5/DBus solution just need hide mode-line with customize face, not need hacking any code of Emacs.

==How to install it ?==
You need install [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro PyQt5]/[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-xlib PythonXlib] first.

Then download minibuffer-tray source code from : https://gitcafe.com/Deepin/deepin-emacs/tree/master/site-lisp/extensions/minibuffer-tray

Last add minibuffer-tray.el.el in your load-path and add 
{{{
(require 'minibuffer-tray)
(minibuffer-tray-mode 1)
}}}
in your ~/.emacs, that's all!
