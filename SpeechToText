These are the programs implementing the actual speech recognition:
* !DragonDictate (proprietary license, Windows only) http://www.ddwin.com/dictate.htm
* Dragon !NaturallySpeaking (proprietary license, Windows only) http://www.ddwin.com/natural.htm
** Natlink is a Python library that interfaces with it. http://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/index.html
* CMU Sphinx http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx

== Interfaces for Emacs ==

There were several packages for driving Emacs through voice input, but none currently maintained.

=== Dormant ===

==== VoiceCode ====
VoiceCode is an Emacs interface to Dragon !NaturallySpeaking (uses Natlink, updated Sept 2, 2019).
https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode/
The last update to the SVN repository was in 2013.

==== voicekey ====
A voice-controlled keyboard for GNU/Linux built on sphinx. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/voicekey/ (unmaintained since August 2013, see https://sourceforge.net/p/voicekey/voicekey/ci/329cc8daac480349a3308121d9e8d35a01725ed4/)

==== vr-mode ====
Emacs interface to Dragon !NaturallySpeaking. 
http://emacs-vr-mode.sourceforge.net/
[new]
The last release announcement (as of Oct 2013) was in 2007...
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=emacs-vr-mode-announce
[new]
:: It seems that vr does only work with Emacs on W32. Is there any equivalent using Dragon Naturally Speaking in a virtual network? I know something like this existed.

==== ShortTalk and EmacsListen ====
EmacsListen is an implemention of ShortTalk. It is based on vr-mode.

http://shorttalk-emacs.sourceforge.net/
[new:XueFuqiao:2013-04-20 06:26 UTC]
EmacsListen is unmaintained.  The latest commit in its [http://shorttalk-emacs.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/shorttalk-emacs/shorttalk-emacs/ CVS Repository] was in 2004.  -- XueFuqiao

== Microphones ==
* It is very important to have a very good noise-canceling microphone.   One source I have come across is the compatibility list of (the NON-FREE) dragon naturally speaking software -- go for the few that meet their highest rating (six stars).

== Presentations ==

Tavis Rudd did a live demo of his customised system in 2013:

[quote]
Two years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.

In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers.
