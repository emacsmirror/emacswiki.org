If you use Emacs in a corporate environment where your employer monitors all the processes on your laptop, looking for suspicious activities, you might end up getting a call from your security team: "Why is Emacs looking for PuTTY credentials in the registry?"

On Windows, that's what Emacs does. There's a variable with the registry key and when you run ##find-file## it activates [[Tramp on Windows]], which looks for known hosts by looking at the PuTTY data in the registryâ€¦

In case you want to disable this:

{{{
(eval-after-load "tramp" '(tramp-without-putty))

(defun tramp-without-putty ()
  "Disable all putty related stuff."
  ;; PuTTY: no snooping for credentials in the registry
  (setq tramp-completion-function-alist-putty nil)
  (defun tramp-parse-putty (&rest ignore) "Never parse PuTTY sessions." nil))
}}}

You probably just need to reset ##tramp-completion-function-alist-putty## but since the call with the security team can be so uncomfortable, perhaps you prefer to be extra careful.
