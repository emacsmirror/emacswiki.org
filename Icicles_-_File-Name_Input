== File-Name Input and Locating Files Anywhere ==

Emacs offers two main functions for reading [[minibuffer]] input with
[[completion]]: `completing-read' and `read-file-name'.  '''Icicles''' uses
both of these, and it enhances each of them in various ways for
use in your own EmacsLisp code. These two functions can each be used to read file-name input, but
they do so in very different ways.

'''Note:''' In addition to the usual '''Icicles''' key bindings, during file-name completion you can use the following keys:

* '''`C-backspace'''' (`icicle-up-directory') to navigate up the directory hierarchy.  It removes the last directory component (and any partial file name) from your minibuffer input.  (For Emacs versions before Emacs 22, this feature is available only for completion of absolute file names.)

* '''`C-x m'''' (`icicle-bookmark-file-other-window') to visit a
bookmarked file or directory.  This is available only if you use
library '''[[Bookmark+]]''' (<tt>[[bookmark+.el]]</tt>).  It is a [[multi-command]], so you can
actually visit any number of file bookmarks.  When finished, you
can continue with non-bookmark file-name completion.

* '''`##C-c +##'''' (`icicle-make-directory') to create a directory on the
fly.

* '''`S-delete'''' to delete the file named by the current completion candidate.

* '''`##M-|##'''' (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to open [[Dired]] on
the currently matching file names.  That is, it opens a special
Dired buffer that contains ''only'' the matching files.  You are
prompted for the Dired buffer name.  See [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands#AlternativeActions|Alternative Actions]].


In many cases for '''Icicles''' multi-commands that read a file name,
you can use '''`M-n'''' to pick up the file name at [[point]], or if none
then the name of the file you are currently visiting.


'''Note:''' Whether a command supports file-name ''globbing wildcards''
such as `##*##' is independent of whether it uses `read-file-name' or
`completing-read'.  It is the command itself that offers such
support or not.  Globbing takes place only after the file name (with
wildcards) is read.  All '''Icicles''' commands that visit files (all of
the commands mentioned in this section) let you use globbing wildcards.  Remember also that file-name globbing, with
its special wildcards, has nothing to do with regexp completion
matching. See [[Icicles - Special Characters in Input Patterns]] for more
information about file-name globbing.









[:read-file-name]
=== Function `read-file-name' ===

Function '''`read-file-name'''' uses '''[::relative file-name completion]'''.

It is specialized for file-name input with
completion.  It knows about files and file names for your current
platform.  It knows about Emacs remote file name syntax ([[TrampMode|Tramp]],
Ange FTP).  And starting with Emacs 23, `TAB' also completes
environment variables during `read-file-name' completion.

Using `read-file-name' is the most flexible way to
read a file name in Emacs, and it is the traditional way.  Unless
stated otherwise, "''file-name completion''", even in the
'''Icicles''' doc, refers to `read-file-name' completion.

When `read-file-name' reads input, only the file name itself, not
the directory portion, is used for matching.  The directory is
understood to be the value of variable `<tt>[[default directory|default-directory]]</tt>' (which
you can change using command `cd', for instance).  The behavior is
thus the same whether or not the directory name is present in the
minibuffer.  If you prefer, you can delete the directory name
first, using `M-k'.

With `read-file-name', you can thus use [[apropos completion]] to match a file-name ''substring'', without needing to prefix the
substring with `'''<tt>.*</tt>'''' in the minibuffer.  For example, to
match the file named `##favorite-foo-file.bar##' in directory
`/some/path/to/my/', you need ''not'' use `##/some/path/to/my/##'''<tt>.*</tt>'''##foo##'; it
is sufficient to use either `foo' or `/some/path/to/my/foo'.










[:completing-read]
[:absolute file-name completion]
=== Function `completing-read' ===

Function '''`completing-read'''' is a general function for reading input
with completion.  It is ''not'' specially designed for reading file
names.  It knows nothing about files and file names. It knows
nothing about remote file-name syntax.  When `completing-read' reads input, it makes no use of
`default-directory'.  The completion candidates are treated as
simple strings; they are not really treated as file names.

'''Icicles''' commands that use `completing-read' to read a file name typically
read an ''absolute'' name, that is, a name that includes the directory
portion.  This means that you can match against ''any part'' of the
full name, including any ''directory'' components.  The directory
portions of the candidate file names need not be the same -- you
can thus complete against a set of files in ''multiple'' directories.










[:ReadingFileNames]
=== Icicles Commands that Read File Names ===

'''Icicles''' commands that use `read-file-name' include all [[multi-command]]s,
such as `icicle-find-file', that are defined using
'''`icicle-define-file-command''''.  Vanilla Emacs command `find-file'
is another example of a command that uses `read-file-name'.

'''Icicles''' commands that use `completing-read' to read file names include the
multi-commands `icicle-find-file-absolute', `icicle-find-file-in-tags-table', `icicle-recent-file', `icicle-locate', `icicle-locate-file', and `icicle-locate-file-no-symlinks'.  These are defined using
'''`icicle-define-command'''', not `##icicle-define##''##-file##''##-command##'.

There are also `-other-window' versions of all of the '''Icicles'''
commands that read file names.

[:LocateByDate]
The '''Icicles''' commands that use `completing-read' to read file names have an
additional feature: you can use a [[prefix argument]] to tell them to
combine the last modification date with the file name, as a
[[multi-completion]]. This means that you can easily look up files whose modification
time or date matches some (regexp) criterion, such as being
sometime in July 2008.

When using a command that reads an absolute file name, remember
that, to save space, you can use '''`##C-x .##'''' to toggle hiding of the
common match portions of the candidates in `*Completions*'.  This
portion is often a long directory substring.

Command '''`icicle-file'''' is bound, by default, to '''`C-x C-f'''' in ''Icicle''
mode, thus taking the place of `find-file'.  It combines
`icicle-find-file' and `icicle-find-file-absolute'.  With ''no''
prefix argument, it matches ''relative'' file names; with a prefix
argument, it matches ''absolute'' names (as ordinary strings).  With a ''negative'' prefix argument, you
can match also the modification date.

An additional feature of `icicle-find-file-absolute' and
`icicle-find-file-absolute-other-window' is that candidates that
are directory names are highlighted in buffer `*Completions*'
using face `icicle-special-candidate'.

Commands '''`icicle-find-file-in-tags-table'''' and
'''`icicle-find-file-in-tags-table-other-window'''' let you visit files
that are listed in the current Emacs [[TagsFile|tags table]].  You can think of these
potential completion candidates as all of the files in a ''project
defined by the tags table''.

You can use '''`icicle-recent-file'''' to open any file that you have
visited recently, perhaps in a previous Emacs session.

You can
use '''`icicle-locate'''' or '''`icicle-locate-file'''' to ''find a file when you do not know what
directory'' it is in.  The former requires
GNU/Linux or UNIX command `locate', to work.  The latter does not
require any external program.

Because it takes advantage of `locate' having indexed files on you
file system, `icicle-locate' can be much faster than
`icicle-locate-file'.  Otherwise, these two '''Icicles''' commands work
similarly.

Since it does not use an index, `icicle-locate-file' looks throughout a given directory,
including throughout all of its subdirectories.  Command '''`icicle-locate-file-no-symlinks'''' is the same, except that
it does not follow symbolic links.  Both of these commands
respect [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-ignored-directoriesflag|icicle-ignored-directories]]</tt>'''', which is a list of
directories to ignore -- by default, version-control directories.

By default, the target directory for `icicle-locate-file' is the
current directory, but if you supply a non-negative [[numeric prefix argument]] (non-positive means include the date), then you are
prompted for the directory to search.  If you use the ''root of your
file system'' as the search directory, then the '''Icicles''' file-locating commands
will match completion candidates ''anywhere in your file system''.

This can be quite useful.  It gives you much of the power of the
Unix `find' command just for completing input.  And with
incremental completion (see [[Icicles - Icompletion]]), you can see
what matches your input as you type.

Obviously, if you use your entire file system as the set of
completion candidates and you use `icicle-locate-file' (because
you do not have available the external program `locate'), then gathering and matching such a large set
of file names can take some time.

On my hard drive, for instance,
there are 36 GB full of files, and it takes about 40 seconds to
gather all of the file names.  In spite of this inconvenience, this functionality can be useful.
And of course searching a shallower directory tree presents less
of a performance penalty -- you pay for what you get.

However, even if you do not have command `locate', there of having your cake and eating it too.
You can gather all of the file names in your file system ''once'', and
save that list of completion candidates to a ''cache file on disk'', as a snapshot.  See [[Icicles - Persistent Completions]] for how to do this.



[:AbsoluteFileNames]
=== Absolute File Names and Different Directories ===

Since `completing-read' has no understanding of file-name syntax,
including remote file-name syntax, `icicle-find-file-absolute'
(`C-u C-x C-f') and similar commands are similarly ignorant.  (You
can nevertheless use '''`##C-.##''' with these '''Icicles''' commands, to toggle respect of `completion-ignored-extensions'.)  In particular, these commands will not let you complete to
a remote file name if the current directory is local.  They also
will not let you complete to a file name in a different local
directory.

Because all '''Icicles''' commands that read file names use [[lax]]
completion, you can nevertheless ''visit'' a file in a different
directory (remote or local) from the current one, even though you
cannot ''complete'' your input to such a name.  That is, you can
always use `RET' with any file name as minibuffer input.

So how can you ''complete'' your input to an ''absolute'' file-name in a
''different directory''?  By retrieving a saved candidate set that has
such absolute names and then completing against that set.  For
example, you can retrieve a set that represents files on a remote
machine and complete to their names even from a local directory.
All that counts for `completing-read' is that your input can match
candidates, where that matching is ordinary (apropos or prefix)
string matching.

To ''create'' such a saved set of names, you can visit the directory
(perhaps remote) that contains the files and then use `C-u C-x C-f' and `##C-}##' to save the candidates.  You can later retrieve
this saved set for completion, no matter what the current
directory is.  As another example, you can use
`icicle-locate-file' in a remote directory to create a saved set
that includes remote files that are all somewhere under that
remote directory.

In addition, you can add more file names to an existing saved set
using `##C->##', `##C-)##', `M-mouse-3', `insert', or `M-S-mouse-2' -- see
[[Icicles - Candidate Sets#SaveMore|Add More Saved Candidates]]. The added names can come
from a different directory than files already in the saved set. In
this way, you can build up a saved set that includes files from
any directories, some of which can be local and some remote, some
remote from one host, some remote from another, and so on. You can
create a saved set with any ''mix of absolute file names from any
locations''.

'''Remember this:'''

* To ''create'' and ''add to'' a saved set of ''absolute'' file names, use a
  command that expects absolute file names, and do this from the
  ''directory that contains the files'' you want to add.

* When you ''retrieve'' a saved set of file-name candidates for
  completion, use a command that expects the same kind of file
  names, relative or absolute, as the saved names.  For example,
  if you save a set of project files that are spread over
  different directories (and hence are absolute), then retrieve
  that candidate set using, say, `C-u C-x C-f' (absolute), not
  `C-x C-f' (relative).


[:C-cC-d]
Finally, although the commands that read absolute file names are
essentially ignorant of directory hierarchies and of file names as
such, so that they treat their candidates only as simple strings,
a few of these commands nevertheless define their domain of
possible file-name candidates relative to some starting directory.

This is the case for `icicle-find-file-absolute' and
`icicle-locate-file' (and their variants).  For these
commands, you can use '''`C-c C-d'''' (think UNIX command `cd') during completion to
change the current working directory (`default-directory') on the
fly.  You are prompted for the directory.  The domain of possible
candidates is recomputed relative to the new `default-directory'.

Use `C-c C-d' this way as many times as you like.  You can use
this feature to add file names from different directories to a
saved set of candidates.  When the command is finished, the
original `default-directory' is restored.
