== Multi-Completions ==

This page is about using [[completion]] candidates that are
composed of ''more than one part'': strings that you can complete
against separately and simultaneously.

== Icicles Multi-Completion Commands ==

Have you ever used standard Emacs [[command]] `apropos-documentation'?
It searches the [[doc string]]s of all EmacsLisp [[symbol]]s for matches
to an input [[regexp]], and displays the hits.  It can be useful when
you do not remember the name of a function or [[variable]] but you can
guess at terms that might occur in its doc string.  Typically,
people resort to it only after first trying apropos commands that
match against the function or variable name.

The idea behind `apropos-documentation' also motivates '''Icicles''' command `icicle-doc'.  This is a [[multi-command]], so you can use `C-RET' and `C-next'
to browse the regexp matches, displaying the documentation of each
match in turn, and you can change the regexp to get different
matches during the same command invocation.

Like `apropos-documentation', '''`icicle-doc'''' lets you match a regexp
against the doc strings of symbols such as functions, variables,
and [[face]]s.  You can of course use [[progressive completion]] to match multiple regexps.  Here, for example, is a query that shows all doc strings (functions, variables, faces -- a ''lot'' of doc strings) that match both `mail' and `##mode line##', in either order, as completion candidates:

 M-x icicle-doc RET mail S-SPC mode line

You cannot do that with vanilla Emacs `apropos-documentation' or with any other vanilla Emacs `##apropos*##' command.

Commands `icicle-vardoc', `icicle-fundoc', and `icicle-plist' are
similar to `icicle-doc' in the kind of functionality they provide.

Each of these commands gathers a tremendous amount of information
to construct an initial set of completion candidates based on all
existing Emacs symbols (in the standard `obarray').  This is
time-consuming.  Since the set of symbols that have property lists
or that name functions, variables, or faces changes little, you
can optionally bypass this gathering and reuse the last initial
set of candidates for that command.  You do this by invoking the
command using a [[prefix argument]] (non-negative prefix arg, for
`icicle-vardoc' and `icicle-plist').

Each of these particular commands also uses '''Icicles''' multi-completion.  A '''[::multi-completion]''' is a completion
candidate that has multiple parts.  A multi-completion command
lets your input match any or all parts individually, at the same time.

With commands that provide multi-completion candidates, you use
[[apropos completion]] ('''`S-TAB''''), not [[prefix completion]] (`TAB'), at
least whenever your input pattern tries to match other than just
the first multi-completion part.


* Commands '''`icicle-vardoc'''' and '''`icicle-fundoc'''' let you match both the function or variable ''name'' and the ''doc'' string.

* Command '''`icicle-doc'''' lets you match any combination of the following:
** the function, variable, or face ''name''
** the ''type'': `FUNCTION', `VARIABLE', or `FACE' (uppercase)
** the ''doc'' string

* Command '''`icicle-plist'''' lets
you match both a symbol ''name'' and its ''[[property list]]''. 
You can use it to find symbols with certain
property-list keys or values.  By default (for Emacs 22 or
later), plists are pretty-printed (in `*Help*' and
`*Completions*'), but if you use a negative prefix argument then
pretty-printing is skipped, gaining a little time.

* Commands '''`icicle-describe-option-of-type'''' (bound to '''`C-h C-o'''' in ''Icicle'' mode), '''`icicle-apropos-options-of-type'''', and '''`icicle-customize-apropos-options-of-type'''' each let
let you match both an
[[option]] ''name'' and the option's `defcustom' ''type'' definition.  There are several ways to match
type definitions, controlled by the prefix argument.  You can match a type directly or taking
type inheritance into account.  You can match a type as a [[sexp]]
or using a regexp.  You can match a type expression or match the
option's current [[symbol value|value]] against a type.  See [[Icicles - A Propos d'Apropos#Type-AwareVariable-AproposMulti-Commands|Type-Aware Variable-Apropos Multi-Commands]].

'''Icicles''' [[Icicles - File-Name Input#LocateByDate|file-name commands that use multi-completion]] include
`icicle-locate-file', `icicle-locate-file-other-window',
`icicle-recent-file', and `icicle-recent-file-other-window'.
These commands let you match against multi-completion
candidates that have an absolute file name part and a part that is the
file's last modification date.  This means that you can easily
find those notes you took sometime last week...

The way multi-completion commands work is a bit inelegant perhaps, and it can take a little getting used to, but it is quite powerful and lets you do things with completion that are otherwise impossible.

In the case of commands that use two-part multi-completions, you provide two
patterns as input, one to match the name of a function or variable and
one to match  some associated information (doc string, property list, or type definition).  However, since completion candidates
are not actually multipart, you in fact type a single pattern that is the
concatenation of the two.  You join these two regexps using
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-list-join-string|icicle-list-join-string]]</tt>'''' (a user option), which, by default, is
`##^G^J##', that is, a control-G character followed by a control-J
(newline) character.  As always, you can input control characters
using `C-q', so to input `##^G^J##' you can use `C-q C-g C-q C-j'.  

However, in '''Icicles''', `C-j' (newline) is self-inserting
during completion, so you do not need to quote it with `C-q' -- you can just
use `C-q C-g C-j'.  Better yet, you can use '''`C-M-j''''
(`icicle-insert-list-join-string') to insert `##^G^J##'.

This has the
added benefit (in Emacs 22 or later) of hiding the `##^G##' -- it's
there, but you do not see it.  This hiding is only cosmetic; you
still match the characters `##^G##' and `##^J##'. In the same way, '''Icicles''' hides the `##^G##' part of `##^G^J##' in
`*Completions*', so the join string appears as a newline character.

This hiding of `##^G##' happens only when option `icicle-list-join-string'
has its (ugly but useful) default value.  If not seeing the join string confuses you and you would prefer
to distinguish multi-completion part separators from ordinary
newline characters, then customize `icicle-list-join-string' -- just remove the following from the Lisp sexp that defines the
default value:

  (set-text-properties 0 1 '(display "") strg)

As an example of using a multi-completion command, you can use the following to match a function name that contains `dired' and its
doc string that contains `file':

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired^G^Jfile S-TAB

That is, you type:

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired C-q C-g C-j file S-TAB

or this:

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired C-M-j file S-TAB

Well, ''almost''.  The way it actually works is that the completion candidates
are themselves formed by concatenating symbol names with their doc
strings, using `icicle-list-join-string'.  Your input regexp is
matched against those candidates.  This means that the input
regexp `##dired^G^Jfile##' would actually match only function names
that ''end'' with `dired' and doc strings that ''begin'' with `file'.

To match `file' against any part of the doc string, you must
explicitly link the two component regexps with a ''regexp that
matches anything''.  If you want to search only the first lines of
doc strings, you can use `##.*##' to do that: `##dired.*^G^J.*file##' will
match all functions whose names contain `dired' and whose doc
strings' first lines contain `file'.

Why only the first lines?  Because '''`##.##'''' matches any character
except a newline -- it does not look past the first line.  If you
want to search the entire doc strings (or property lists, for
`icicle-plist'), then you need to use a connecting regexp that
matches any character, including a newline.  That means a regexp
such as `##\(.\|\n\)##'.  Or you can just use the '''Icicles''' ''multi-line
dot'' feature -- see [[Icicles - Dot, Dot, Dot]].

Without a multi-line dot, you would use something like this to
search whole, multi-line doc strings for `file':

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired.*^G^J\(.\|\n\)*file S-TAB

That is, you would type (without the spaces):

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired.* C-M-j \ ( . \ | C-j \ ) * file S-TAB

With a multi-line dot, you would type just this:

  M-x icicle-fundoc dired.* C-M-j . * file S-TAB

What if you want to match, say, `file' in ''either'' the function name
or the doc string, not necessarily both?  Remember that a
multi-completion is in fact a single string, with a separator such
as `##^G^J##' in the middle somewhere.  Because it is a single string,
the simple minibuffer input `file' matches the substring `file'
anywhere in the multi-completion.  So the answer is just this:

  M-x icicle-fundoc file S-TAB

Even this simple command expression combines the effect of Emacs commands
`apropos-function' with that of `apropos-documentation'.











[:ModeLineIndicator]
== Mode-Line Lighter Indication of Multi-Completion ==

Whenever multi-completion candidates are available, the `Icy'
minor-mode lighter has the suffix '''`##||##'''' (think "parallel") appended
to it.  You can see this lighter at the left of the [[mode line]] of
buffer `*Completions*' or in the [[minor mode]] part of other mode
lines.










[:HowMultiCompletionsWork]
== How Multi-Completions Work ==

These commands that accept a multipart regexp are examples of
'''Icicles''' multi-completion.  '''Icicles''' extends standard function
`completing-read' so that it will accept, as the set of completion
candidates, an [[alist]] argument whose candidates are not only individual
strings but can also be ''[[list]]s of strings''.  Each string in the list
is one part of a multipart completion candidate, that is, a
'''[::multi-completion]'''.  The strings are joined together pairwise using
`icicle-list-join-string' by `completing-read'.  Commands
`icicle-fundoc', and`icicle-vardoc' each use lists
of two strings (name and doc), but a multi-completion can have any
number of strings.

Why is the default value of `icicle-list-join-string' so odd:
`##^G^J##'?  You can use any string you like, but here is the
rationale behind the default choice:

* ##^G## does not normally occur in simple strings such as doc strings
* a newline (##^J##) visually separates the multiple component strings
* ##^G^J## is not too difficult to enter: `C-M-j' or `C-q C-g C-j'

It is important that the value of `icicle-list-join-string' not be
something that is, itself, likely to match any of the candidates.
Otherwise, it would not serve its role as separator.

I find that it helps a bit (in Emacs 22 or later) to customize
face `escape-glyph', which is used for control characters such as
`^G', in such a way that it stands out a bit, especially because
control characters can be used in regexps that also use `^' as a special character. I use an orange background with a blue foreground for this face.












[:MatchingThingsInParallel]
== Multi-Completions Let You Match Multiple Things in Parallel ==

Consider the command `describe-option-of-type', defined in my
library <tt>[[help-fns+.el]]</tt> (or <tt>[[help+.el]]</tt>, for Emacs 20).  This lets
you first pick a `defcustom' type using completion and then pick
an option of that type to describe.  There are two separate, sequential acts
of completion.  For each completion act, your current input
defines a set of matches.  You can see all option types that
match, say, the regexp `##.*string##', which means all types that
contain `string'.  After you choose one of those types, you can
see all options of that type whose names start with `icicle' and
then pick one.

You can thus tweak the type regexp to filter types, and you can
tweak the name regexp to filter option names.  And you can of
course use progressive completion to whittle down either set of
matches, piecemeal.

What you ''cannot'' do, however, using `describe-option-of-type' is ''filter both
sets at the same time'': narrow down the set of type matches and
name matches simultaneously.  For that, you need '''Icicles'''
multi-completion.  Without it, you must commit 100% to a type
before you can choose among the options of that type.  With it,
you can change the type (or the name) part of your input regexp on
the fly, and see immediately the set of matching names (or types)
as well.











[:MultiCompletionsVsCRM]
== Multi-Completions vs completing-read-multiple ==

Note that there is (only) a superficial similarity between '''Icicles'''
multi-completion and the functionality provided by function
`completing-read-multiple' of standard Emacs library `##crm.el##'.  The
latter lets you complete multiple strings in the [[minibuffer]], one at a time.  It involves only vanilla Emacs completion, and it uses the same set of completion candidates for
each of the strings in the input.

By contrast, '''Icicles''' multi-completion completes each part of your
input against a ''different'' set of completion candidates.  For
example, when you use `icicle-vardoc', it completes the
variable-name part of your input against the names of defined
variables, and the variable-description part against the doc
strings of defined variables.  Standard Emacs command `completing-read-multiple' lets you
complete several different variable names at the same minibuffer
prompt, but they each complete against the same set of variable
names.

Multi-completion matches a list of regexps in ''parallel''.  See also the descriptions of `M-*' and `S-SPC', which match a list of regexps in ''series'': [[Icicles - Progressive Completion]].  You can combine these features, of course. 










[:SortingBySecondPart]
== Sorting Candidates by Their Second Part ==

Most multi-completions have two parts.  Typically, the first part
is the main part, that is, the part that you will most frequently
complete against.  Many candidate sort orders involve some flavor of
alphabetic order, and this means alphabetizing first with respect
to the first multi-completion part.

However, it can sometimes be convenient to sort instead by the
second part first.  That is what the '''Icicles''' sort order "##by 2nd parts
alphabetically##" is for.  You can use it, for example, with command
`icicle-locate-file' to sort file-name candidates first by date,
and then by file-name for the same date.  This gives you an easy
way to look up ''files that you modified during a given time period''.
For example, your input regexp can limit candidates to those files
last modified sometime in July, 2008, and you can then access these
chronologically (by cycling or in buffer `*Completions*').  And do not
forget that you can always reverse the current sort order, using
`##C-##'''''##N##'''''## C-,##' where '''''##N##''''' is an integer.












[:icicle-buffer]
[:icicle-file-of-content]
[:icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content]
[:icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content-other-window]
[:InvisibleMulti-CompletionParts]
== Multi-Completions with a Part You Never See ==

Some [[multi-command]]s, such as `icicle-buffer' (`C-x b'), and
`icicle-file' (`C-x C-f'), `icicle-visit-marked-file-of-content'
(`C-F' in [[Dired]]), and `icicle-Info-goto-node' (`g' in [[Info]]), do
not show the second part of multi-completion candidates in
`*Completions*', because it would just be distracting.  The point
of such commands is to access a named container (buffer, file, or
node), and the optional second multi-completion part matches the
entire container content (the buffer, file, or node text).

See [[Icicles - Searching Named Containers]] for more about this.
