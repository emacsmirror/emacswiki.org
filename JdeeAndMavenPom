== Parse Maven POMs ==

Many Java projects use [http://maven.apache.org Apache Maven] as build
tool. Maven uses a XML file dubbed POM to describe the project and its
dependencies. As it is tedious to enter the same information again
into the prj.el files for the JDEE, Lisp:pom.el
provides a way to parse these files and use the information to
configure the JavaDevelopmentEnvironment.

All you need to do is to put pom.el in your load-path and add a
snippet of emacs lisp into your prj.el files:

<pre>
(require 'pom)
(let ((pom (pom-read-pom)))
  (jde-project-file-version "1.0")
  (jde-set-variables
   '(jde-javadoc-gen-destination-directory "./target/docs/apidocs")
   '(jde-project-name (pom-get-project-id pom))
   '(jde-global-classpath (pom-get-classpath pom))))
</pre>

Download:pom.el

Here is also a complimentary prj.el I usually put into the src/java and src/test
subdirectories, so that the JDEE honours the standard maven project
structure. It ensures that the compiled classes go into the right
target directory if you use jde-compile instead of a full maven build.

<pre>
(jde-project-file-version "1.0")
(jde-set-variables
 '(jde-compile-option-directory "./../../target/classes"))
</pre>

This does not accept all POMs.  A pom starting with

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
</pre>

will be rejected.  The start element needs to be <code><?xml></code> with no attributes or extra spaces.
