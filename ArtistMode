Artist is an Emacs lisp package that allows you to draw lines,
rectangles, squares, poly-lines, ellipses and circles by using your
mouse and/or keyboard. The shapes are made up with the ascii
characters |, -, / and \.

It is part of Emacs (though you may need to add a require statement for it) and can also be retrieved from
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~tab/artist/.

You will use the mouse for drawing and painting if you are running Emacs in an X-window, as in other graphics programs. But you can also use artist-mode when you are running on a terminal. To see how it works, type:

   M-x artist-mode RET
   C-c C-a p RET
   RET

and move the TextCursor around -- you are drawing a poly-line.

Look at the artist-mode documentation (C-h m RET) for full explanation.

Beta version of xemacs port could be found at Lisp:artist-xmas.el

[new:StefanKamphausen:2004-11-26 10:07 UTC] What exactly is the beta in it?  It seems to work quite well.  One minor issue I noticed is that when you have line numbers turned on via setnu-mode the point where drawing takes place is shifted by the appropriate space to the left of the MousePointer. -- StefanKamphausen

It's beta because it is not checked well. Function artist-mouse-draw-poly still has some problems. I'll try to fix your issue when I have time.

= Integration with ido =
I use [[InteractivelyDoThings]] to change drawing operations and settings:

    ;;; integrate ido with artist-mode
   (defun artist-ido-select-operation (type)
     "Use ido to select a drawing operation in artist-mode"
     (interactive (list (ido-completing-read "Drawing operation: " 
                                             (list "Pen" "Pen Line" "line" "straight line" "rectangle" 
                                                   "square" "poly-line" "straight poly-line" "ellipse" 
                                                   "circle" "text see-thru" "text-overwrite" "spray-can" 
                                                   "erase char" "erase rectangle" "vaporize line" "vaporize lines" 
                                                   "cut rectangle" "cut square" "copy rectangle" "copy square" 
                                                   "paste" "flood-fill"))))
     (artist-select-operation type))

   (defun artist-ido-select-settings (type)
     "Use ido to select a setting to change in artist-mode"
     (interactive (list (ido-completing-read "Setting: " 
                                             (list "Set Fill" "Set Line" "Set Erase" "Spray-size" "Spray-chars" 
                                                   "Rubber-banding" "Trimming" "Borders"))))
     (if (equal type "Spray-size") 
       (artist-select-operation "spray set size")
       (call-interactively (artist-fc-get-fn-from-symbol 
			    (cdr (assoc type '(("Set Fill" . set-fill)
					       ("Set Line" . set-line)
					       ("Set Erase" . set-erase)
					       ("Rubber-banding" . rubber-band)
					       ("Trimming" . trimming)
					       ("Borders" . borders)
					       ("Spray-chars" . spray-chars))))))))

   (add-hook 'artist-mode-init-hook 
	     (lambda ()
	       (define-key artist-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-a C-o") 'artist-ido-select-operation)
	       (define-key artist-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-a C-c") 'artist-ido-select-settings)))

= Artist Mode Hook=
You can define custom quick-actions specific to artist mode by attaching it to the artist-mode-hook like so:

    (add-hook 'artist-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (local-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'org-mode)
	    (local-set-key (kbd "<f2>") 'artist-select-op-pen-line) ; f2 = pen mode
            (local-set-key (kbd "<f3>") 'artist-select-op-line)     ; f3 = line
	    (local-set-key (kbd "<f4>") 'artist-select-op-square)   ; f4 = rectangle
	    (local-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'artist-select-op-ellipse)  ; f5 = ellipse
	    (local-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo)
     ))

---
= Artist Mode and Org-Mode =
One should note that artist mode doesn't seem to function well in org-mode when headers are collapsed.
As a workaround, show all headers before activating artist mode:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-<f1>") (lambda()
			       (interactive)
			       (show-all)
			       (artist-mode)))

----
Note: If using the keyboard to draw, use C-u RET to stop drawing.
