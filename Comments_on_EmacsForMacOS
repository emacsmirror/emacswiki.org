Hi,

very good conclusion on Emacs For Mac OS, but some Packages on Mac OS Snow Leopard  hang by trying to compile. I have had several Problems with Org-Mode in one Modul - the Rest of Org-Mode compiles fine. I testet it with Homebrew, Ports and Aquamacs, ( GNU Emacs 24.5.1) and Org-Mode 8.2.10. Maybe it would a idea to include a Test of Package-Installation in this Site and give a short Feedback, which package does compile without problems. I would try now older package-versions for Org-Mode.

Sincerly
Thorsten

Regarding Homebrew, I prefer this variant:
<pre>
brew install railwaycat/emacsmacport/emacs-mac --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick --with-official-icon --with-xml2
</pre>

Here is why:

* TLS support is important for Gnus and IRC
* Image Magick is important to view and edit images
* XML is important for parsing documents
* I like the official icon and don't need to distinguish between this Emacs and any other "official" Emacs

The wiki claims "After installation, using the emacs command in the terminal or shell will run the -nw version of Emacs." but this is appears to be untrue: after installing with 'brew cask install emacs' using the emacs command opens the windowed application. Inspection of the Ruby script symlinked by the Homebrew installation, /usr/local/bin/emacs -> /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs, gives no indication that the emacs command from teh terminal or shell will run emacs with the -nw.

This statement in the wiki needs to be either corrected to reflect the actual behaviour or, if this is a bug which needs to be fixed, instructions for resolving the buggy behaviour needs to be provided.

Please correct the wiki to reflect the actual behaviour...
