From the manual, [[Manual:Directory Variables]]

: If you put a file with a special name ##.dir-locals.el## in a
directory, Emacs will read it when it visits any file in that directory
or any of its subdirectories, and apply the settings it specifies to
the file's buffer.  Emacs searches for `.dir-locals.el' starting in the
directory of the visited file, and moving up the directory tree.

The `.dir-locals.el' file should hold a specially-constructed list.
This list maps Emacs mode names (symbols) to alists; each alist
specifies values for variables to use when the respective mode is
turned on.  The special mode name `nil' means that its alist applies to
any mode.  Instead of a mode name, you can specify a string that is a
name of a subdirectory of the project's directory; then the
corresponding alist applies to all the files in that subdirectory.

Here's an example of a `.dir-locals.el' file:

     ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
              (tab-width . 4)
              (fill-column . 80)))
      ;; Warn about spaces used for indentation:
      (haskell-mode . ((eval . (highlight-regexp "^ *"))))
      (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      (java-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      ("src/imported"
       . ((nil . ((change-log-default-name . "ChangeLog.local"))))))

----

As of Emacs 24:

* You can stop directory local vars from applying to subdirectories.
Add an element (subdirs . nil) to the alist portion of any variables
settings to indicate that the section should not apply to
subdirectories.

* Directory local variables can apply to some file-less buffers.
Affected modes include dired, vc-dir, and log-edit.  For example,
adding "(diff-mode . ((mode . whitespace)))" to .dir-locals.el will
turn on `whitespace-mode' for %%*vc-diff*%% buffers.  Modes should call
`hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer' to support this.

As of Emacs 24.3:

* You can set the variable `enable-remote-dir-locals' to apply such
values on remote files. (If you're using an earlier version of Emacs,
see below.)

== Remote files (via TrampMode) ==

This is not enabled by default. See below.

Example usage /without/ using .dir-locals.el:

    (dir-locals-set-class-variables
     'plone-core
     '((nil . ((buffer-read-only . t)))))
    
    (dir-locals-set-class-variables
     'plone-instance
     '((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . nil)
               (fill-column . 80)))
       ;; (python-mode . (()))
       ))
    
    (dir-locals-set-directory-class
     "/scpc:(user)@(host):/home/(user)/Plone/" 'plone-core)
    
    (dir-locals-set-directory-class
     "/scpc:(user)@(host):/home/(user)/Plone/zinstance/" 'plone-instance)

By default (for performance reasons), Emacs will *not* attempt to
apply directory local variables to buffers visiting remote files (via
tramp); however it can be configured to do so, if you are willing to
incur the associated performance cost (which can be relatively minimal
in some situations)

In Emacs 24.3+, see the `enable-remote-dir-locals' variable.

For earlier versions we can advise `hack-dir-local-variables' to work
around the default behaviour:

    ;; Enable directory local variables with remote files. This facilitates both
    ;; the (dir-locals-set-class-variables ...)(dir-locals-set-directory-class ...)
    ;; and the .dir-locals.el approaches.
    (defadvice hack-dir-local-variables (around my-remote-dir-local-variables)
      "Allow directory local variables with remote files, by temporarily redefining
    `file-remote-p' to return nil unconditionally."
      (flet ((file-remote-p (&rest) nil))
        ad-do-it))
    (ad-activate 'hack-dir-local-variables)
