This page is not to be confused with //sandbox.el// at
http://panix.com/~tehom/my-code/, which can be used to help check the
security of new elisp code.

This page is the place to '''try stuff'''. You can also use the
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test Test Wiki] for testing.
If you need your own wiki, try the
[http://communitywiki.org/odd Oddwiki].

'''Please make all edits here minor:''' check the box below the
editing field marked "This change is a minor edit."

See HowTo for editing tips. Click "Edit this page" at the
bottom of any page to examine its source code and see how others have
done things. Then come back here to experiment. Note that you need not save
your edits to see how they look; you can just click '''Preview'''.
