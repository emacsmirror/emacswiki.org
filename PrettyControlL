== Pretty Control-L: Library pp-c-l.el ==

This page describes library <tt>[[pp-c-l.el]]</tt>, which displays Control-l (`##^L##') characters in a pretty way.

Control-l is also called the "form feed" character. In many programming languages it is written as `##\f##'. The name "form feed" comes from printers that interpret the character as a page break signal, feeding another form (page). Here's what Wikipedia says about it:

: "The form feed character is sometimes used in plain text files of source code as a delimiter for a page break, or as marker for sections of code. Some editors, in particular emacs, has built-in commands to page up/down on the form feed character. This convention is predominantly used in lisp code, and is also seen in Python source code."

A Control-l character in an Emacs text [[buffer]] (e.g. code) appears normally as `##^L##', if option `ctl-arrow' is non-`nil', or as `##\014##' (octal 14) if that option is `nil'. It serves as a page-break character for many printers, and, by convention, in code it serves to distinguish sections of code. The Emacs commands for navigating among pages (e.g. `forward-page', bound to `##C-x ]##') simply look for Control-l characters. You can also just use `C-s C-q C-l' to search for them. See PageCommands for more.

While Control-l is useful as a section or page separator, `##^L##' or `##\014##' is a bit ugly, and it doesn't really let users know that if they print the text a page break will occur at that position.

In Emacs, you can give any character a different display appearance, by redefining its entry in the current display table. Library <tt>[[pp-c-l.el]]</tt> does this to give Control-l a better appearance. You can easily customize this appearance, without fiddling with the display table yourself.  

This screenshot shows the default appearance:

[[image:PrettyControlLImage]]

Everything between the commented lines corresponds to a single Control-l character. It is (by default) the equivalent of a newline followed by 10 spaces, the text "##Section (Printable Page)##" and 10 more spaces.

You can toggle the pretty display on and off, using minor mode `pretty-control-l-mode'.

See Also: OverlayControlL for an alternative approach, which uses an overlay.

Hey Drew,

This library would be even awesomer if by default it put the string that page-ext.el chooses for its titles (see `pages-directory') into the highlighted boxes. -- DaveAbrahams


[new:DrewAdams:2011-08-08 15:37 UTC]
Thanks for your suggestion.  I wasn't even aware of (standard library) ##page-ext.el##.  However, IIUC, I don't see how [[pp-c-l.el]] could do what you suggest.  It uses the syntax table to change the display appearance of ##^L## chars generally (i.e. everywhere).  I think what you're asking for is to visually replace ##^L## by different page "headers" --- i.e., different appearance for different pages.  I don't see how that would be possible.  But patches and more info are welcome. -- DrewAdams

Cool! -- ViniciusJoseLatorre

=== problem with whitespace-mode? ===

i have a problem with whitespace-mode. My setup is this:

 (require 'pp-c-l)
 (setq pp^L-^L-string
       "                                                           ")
 (pretty-control-l-mode 1)

and

<pre>
;; Make whitespace-mode with very basic background coloring for whitespaces
(setq whitespace-style
      '(spaces tabs newline space-mark tab-mark newline-mark))
</pre>

<pre>
;; Make whitespace-mode and whitespace-newline-mode
;; use “¶” for end of line char and ▷ for tab.
(setq whitespace-display-mappings
      '((space-mark 32 [183] [46]) ; normal space, MIDDLE DOT, FULL STOP.
        (space-mark 160 [164] [95]) 
        (space-mark 2208 [2212] [95]) 
        (space-mark 2336 [2340] [95]) 
        (space-mark 3616 [3620] [95]) 
        (space-mark 3872 [3876] [95]) 
        (newline-mark 10 [182 10]) ; newlne
        (tab-mark 9 [9655 9] [92 9]))) ; tab
</pre>

this should make it look like this (second screenshot):
http://xahlee.org/emacs/whitespace-mode.html
however, it seems when pretty print is loaded, all those triangle and middle dot doesn't show. -- XahLee

Maybe someone else can help, here. I don't use `whitespace-mode'.  I confirm that there is a problem.  If I follow your instructions minus loading ##pp-c-l.el##, and I turn on `global-whitespace-mode', then I see what you expect (your screenshot).  If I then load ##pp-c-l.el## the whitespace effect is gone --- even if I then turn off `pretty-control-l-mode'.

AFAICT, the only thing `pretty-control-l-mode' does is change the display-table entry for one character (form-feed, aka ^L).  Dunno why that would louse things up so much.

Perhaps someone familiar with `whitespace-mode' (Vinicius?) can look into this.  From your mail to ##help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org## ([http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2011-03/msg00891.html]),
the same problem seems to exist with at least some other libraries, besides ##pp-c-l.el##.  If you do make progress debugging this and can point to a problem in the <tt>[[pp-c-l.el]]</tt> code I'll try to take a look.  Sorry.  -- DrewAdams
