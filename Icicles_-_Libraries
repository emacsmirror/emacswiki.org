== Icicles Libraries ==

"'''Icicles'''" refers to a set of libraries that enhance [[minibuffer]] input, providing [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] among completion candidates and more powerful [[completion]]. It is composed of the following '''''required''''' libraries:



[:Required]
=== Required ===
* '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' -- main library
* <tt>[[icicles-chg.el]]</tt> -- change logs (no code)
* <tt>[[icicles-cmd1.el]]</tt> -- top-level [[command]]s, part 1
* <tt>[[icicles-cmd2.el]]</tt> -- top-level commands, part 2
* <tt>[[icicles-doc1.el]]</tt> -- first part of the doc (##Commentary##, no code)
* <tt>[[icicles-doc2.el]]</tt> -- second part of the doc (##Commentary##, no code)
* <tt>[[icicles-face.el]]</tt> -- [[face]]s (customizable)
* <tt>[[icicles-fn.el]]</tt> -- non-interactive functions
* <tt>[[icicles-mac.el]]</tt> -- macros
* <tt>[[icicles-mcmd.el]]</tt> -- minibuffer commands
* <tt>[[icicles-mode.el]]</tt> -- ''Icicle'' mode definition
* <tt>[[icicles-opt.el]]</tt> -- [[user option]]s (customizable [[variable]]s)
* <tt>[[icicles-var.el]]</tt> -- internal variables

When you load (e.g. `load-library' or `require') the driver library, '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''', the others are all loaded automatically, except for ##icicles-chg.el##, ##icicles-doc1.el## and ##icicles-doc2.el##, which need not be loaded (they contain only a change log and documentation, as comments).





[:Optional]
=== Optional, But Recommended ===
The following libraries are recommended but '''''optional''''' (loaded by <tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt> if
in your `load-path', otherwise ignored).  They are enhanced by '''Icicles''', or '''Icicles''' is enhanced by them, or both.


||<tt>[[apropos-fn+var.el]]</tt> ||Apropos enhancements for functions and [[variable]]s. ||
||<tt>[[bookmark+.el]]</tt> etc.||Many bookmark enhancements. See '''[[Bookmark+]]''' and [[Icicles - Bookmark Enhancements]].||
||<tt>[[col-highlight.el]]</tt> ||Required by ##crosshairs.el## (Emacs 22+). See HighlightCurrentColumn.||
||<tt>[[crosshairs.el]]</tt> ||Highlight target positions -- see CrosshairHighlighting.||
||<tt>[[doremi.el]]</tt>, <tt>[[doremi-frm.el]]</tt> ||Incremental changes -- see [[Icicles - Completions Display]], [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion#SwankCompletion|Icicles - Fuzzy Symbol Completion]], and [[option]] <tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-max-candidates|icicle-max-candidates]]</tt>.||
||<tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> ||[[FrameModes#frame-cmds.el|Frame and window commands]].||
||<tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt> ||See [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion]].||
||<tt>[[hexrgb.el]]</tt> ||Color manipulation.  I strongly recommend that you include this library.||
||<tt>[[hl-line+.el]]</tt> ||Required by ##crosshairs.el## (Emacs 22+). See HighlightCurrentLine.||
||<tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt> ||See [[Icicles - Icompletion]] and '''[[IcompleteMode#IcompleteModePlus|Icomplete+]]'''.||
||<tt>[[info+.el]]</tt> ||See [[Icicles - Info Enhancements]] and '''[[Info+]]'''.||
||<tt>[[lacarte.el]]</tt> ||Keyboard access to the [[menu bar]] menus -- see '''LaCarte'''.  Used with '''Icicles''', you can type a substring or a [[regexp]] that matches any part of a [[menu bar]] menu tree, and you can cycle among [[completion]] candidates to easily navigate menus and choose a menu item.||
||<tt>[[mb-depth+.el]]</tt> ||MinibufferDepthIndicator, for recursive [[minibuffer]]s (Emacs 22 and later).||
||<tt>[[pp+.el]]</tt> ||Pretty-printing for `##M-:##'.  See '''[[EvaluatingExpressions#PpPlus|Pp+]]'''.||
||<tt>[[synonyms.el]]</tt> ||A hypertext thesaurus.  See '''[[Synonyms]]'''.||
||<tt>[[thingatpt+.el]]</tt> ||Better defaults when using commands; better possibilities for `##M-.##'. See '''[[ThingAtPoint+]]''' and [[Icicles - Inserting Text from Cursor]].||
||<tt>[[vline.el]]</tt> ||Required by ##crosshairs.el## (Emacs 22+). See VlineMode.||

Be aware that some of these libraries in turn require other libraries.  For example, library ##frame-cmds.el## requires library <tt>[[frame-fns.el]]</tt>

Depending on your platform, if you use '''Icicles''' in a text
terminal (that is, without a window system/manager), then you
might need to change some of the key bindings, if some of the
default bindings are not available to you.

If on your platform, for example, Emacs in a text terminal does
not recognize a key such as `S-TAB' (as something different from
`TAB'), then you will want to change that key binding.  To
customize '''Icicles''' key bindings, see [[Icicles - Customizing Key Bindings]].  You
might also want to customize some of the '''Icicles''' faces, since a
text terminal is sometimes limited in the colors it can handle.

[:byte-compile]
It is of course best to byte-compile all of the libraries (except ##icicles-chg.el##, ##icicles-doc1.el##, and ##icicles-doc2.el##).  You
will likely get some byte-compiler warning messages.  These are
probably benign -- ignore them.  '''Icicles''' is designed to work with
multiple versions of Emacs, and that fact provokes compiler
warnings.  If you get byte-compiler errors (not warnings), then
please report a bug, using `M-x icicle-send-bug-report'.

Whenever you update '''Icicles''' (i.e., download new versions of
'''Icicle''' source files), I recommend that you do the following:

# Delete all existing byte-compiled '''Icicles''' files (##icicles*.elc##).
# Load '''Icicles''' (`load-library' or `require').
# Byte-compile the source files.

In particular, always load ##icicles-mac.el## (''not'' ##icicles-mac.el##<u>##c##</u>)
before you byte-compile new versions of the files, in case there
have been any changes to Lisp macros (in ##icicles-mac.el##).

After startup, you can turn ''Icicle'' mode on or off at any time
interactively, using command '''`icy-mode'''' (aka `icicle-mode' --
prefix `icy' is unique to this command, so it is easier to
complete).

'''Note:''' If you turn on ''Icicle'' mode in your [[init file]], it's generally best to do so as late as possible -- after you or any libraries that you
load do any key binding.  This is because '''Icicles''' uses the
current global key bindings to determine which keys to bind for
minibuffer completion and cycling.  To pick up the latest
bindings at any time, you can of course enter ''Icicle'' mode
interactively using command `icy-mode' (if necessary, exit, then
re-enter).

'''Note:''' '''Icicles''' redefines some functions when you are in ''Icicle''
mode (it restores them when you leave ''Icicle'' mode).  It
generally does not use `defadvice' to alter the functions; it
redefines them instead.  Because of this, there can be
incompatibilities with other libraries that also change the same
functions (using `defadvice' or otherwise).  An example is ViperMode.  If you load Viper before '''Icicles''', then you will run into
problems with function `read-file-name' because it is tweaked by
both Viper and Icicles.  If you load '''Icicles''' before Viper, you
should not encounter this problem (but you might encounter other
problems: both '''Icicles''' and Viper try to control the minibuffer).




== Checking What Has Changed ==

Here's one way to check which '''Icicles''' libraries have changed recently: '''[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rc;match=%5Cicicles.*.el?$;days=28;all=1;showedit=1 Latest Icicles Changes]'''

== Downloading Icicles Libraries ==

[new:DrewAdams:2013-10-16 20:12 UTC]
'''NOTE:''' '''Icicles''', as well as my other libraries that are on %%EmacsWiki%% are also obtainable from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/|MELPA]].  What's more, you can be pretty sure that they are untampered with, because their wiki pages are locked except to %%EmacsWiki%% administrators.
[new]


You can download the '''Icicles''' files individually from ElispArea, by clicking the file link and then right-clicking the `Download' link for each, and choosing `Save As' in your browser.  You will need to do that on ''each'' file page.

Alternatively, there are ways you can download all of the files at once. Some of these means were provided by '''Icicles''' users.

[new:DrewAdams:2009-04-17 07:54 UTC]
'''Note:''' The %%EmacsWiki%% ElispArea always has the latest version of '''Icicles'''.  If you want to be sure to have the latest version, then either download the files individually there or use one of the first two methods described below (within Emacs and using a shell script).  The files obtained by the other methods are updated only periodically (e.g. once a week).  

If you have Emacs 24 or later, then the first method is probably the easiest way to obtain up-to-date '''Icicles''' files.
[new]



'''1.''' '''Within Emacs''' -- Alternative ways:

* You can download '''Icicles''' from [[MELPA]].  If you use Emacs 24 or later, you can both download and install it from within Emacs, easily.  To do that, you first need to add `melpa' to list `package-archives'.  Then use `M-x list-packages' and click `icicles' in the list of available pacakges.  Use code like this to add `melpa' to the list of available archives:

       (when (> emacs-major-version 23)
        (require 'package)
        (package-initialize)
        (add-to-list 'package-archives 
                     '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")
                     'APPEND))

* Use library <tt>[[icicles-install.el]]</tt>. See the simple instructions in the file header. Based on the [[ELPA]] initialization code. It uses [[UrlPackage]], if available; else it uses `wget'. Thanks to AnupamSengupta for this.

* Use library <tt>[[auto-install.el]]</tt>. Setup like this: ##(setq auto-install-save-confirm nil)##. Do `M-x auto-install-batch', then enter `icicles'.  -- Thanks to AndyStewart for this.




'''2.''' '''Using a shell script:''' (UNIX, GNU/Linux) Use `wget': <tt>[[get-icicles.sh]]</tt>. Thanks to LeWang for that. Thanks to MishaGorodnitzky for tweaking it to get around an EmacsWiki limit on how many files you can download per second.
	  
Note: Bash complains with the message "./get-icicles.sh: line 67: [: missing `]'", but the line looks fine, and the script works anyway.

[new]
: It looks like you need to use -a instead of &&, or else this line fails and it won't create the backup, at least on cygwin bash.  So, the correct line is

   if [ -z "$no_backup"  -a  -d "$dir" ]; then

: -- [[c-98-210-60-2.hsd1.ca.comcast.net]]

[new:DrewAdams:2013-05-14 02:32 UTC]
:: Feel free to test what you think is better and then update the script to correct it.  Thx -- DrewAdams

'''3.''' '''Using git''': The GitHubMirror
contains a git repository that includes the '''[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/icicles Icicles files]]''' (https://github.com/emacsmirror/icicles), as well as other repositories.

The '''Icicles''' repository contains the full git history of each '''Icicles''' file, but it does not include any of the other libraries on which '''Icicles''' depends or which '''Icicles''' can take advantage of.  (The git commit messages themselves are not meaningful.)  Those related libraries are also available on the GitHubMirror, but
in ''separate'' git repositories.

Note that repository names on
github cannot contain a plus character (`##+##').  So, for example, '''[[Bookmark+]]''' files are available from repository
https://github.com/emacsmirror/bookmark-plus, not ##https://github.com/emacsmirror/bookmark+##.



[:ZipFileDownload]
'''4.''' '''Using a zip file:''' You can download an automatically generated zip file of '''Icicles''' files from the '''[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/icicles
Icicles repository]]''' on the GitHubMirror.  The zip file contains only the '''Icicles''' files, not any related files (see #'''3''').



'''5'''. '''Python script''': <tt>[[icicles_dler.py]]</tt>.  Runs
under python2.5.2.  Thanks to DarrenYin.  (The script is still "somewhat
sketchy". -- DarrenYin)


'''6.''' '''Using `wget' directly :''' 
* Required libraries:
##wget http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/icicles{,-chg,-cmd1,-cmd2,-doc1,-doc2,-face,-fn,-mac,-mcmd,-mode,-opt,-var}.el##
* Optional libraries:
##wget http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/{apropos-fn%2bvar,bookmark%2b,col-highlight,crosshairs,doremi,doremi-frm,frame-cmds,fuzzy-match,hexrgb,hl-line%2b,icomplete%2b,info%2b,lacarte,mb-depth%2b,pp%2b,synonyms,thingatpt%2b,vline}.el##
