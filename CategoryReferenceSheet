This category is for Emacs [[key]] reference sheet examples.
Feel free to copy an existing sheet and make adjustments.
Be sure to link to it from here.


== Short Lists ==

These list are intentionally short -- maybe 50 keys or less.
Ideally, they would fit nicely on a mug.  :)

* [[http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/beyond-tutorial.html Reference Sheet by John Sturdy]] -- Concise summary of keys, [[command]]s, terminology, [[regexp]] syntax….

== Discussion ==

[new]
I looked at Alex's idea, find it useful and tried to marry it with a self documenting editor named Emacs. 
I gave the married couple the name ##key-cat.el##.
Even though the marriage is not yet stable you can visit the couple at
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/files/head%3A/util/.
They are awaiting at least one baby which they speak about as ##:groups##.

It looks very neat! -- AlexSchroeder

I added an example for those who do not want to try key-cat.el themselves:
http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/tut/key-cat1.html

There are several things to tweak there, of course.
The important thing is just that it allows for easy viewing and printing of reference cards.
If someone want to improve it it would be great!
