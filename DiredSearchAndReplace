In DiredMode, 'Q' will query-replace-regexp on each filesname marked.  As with query-replace-regexp, a prefix arg will limit the search to whole words.

To mark files, there are a number of options including:
* use the `m' key to mark individual files
* `##% m##' to mark all filenames matching a regexp
* `##% g##' to mark all files containing a regexp
* `##% m RET##' (empty regexp) to mark all files.  If there are no files already marked, you can use `t' to do the same thing (it toggles marked and unmarked files).

Use the `i' key on a subdirectory name to include the subdirectory in the dired listing, before marking as above.

Note also there are options to recursively find files into a dired buffer for marking and replacing as above: 
* `find-grep-dired' to find all files containing a grep match
* `find-name-dired' to find all filenames matching a given shell wildcard pattern
* `find-dired' allows you to specify freeform arguments to find

As far as I can see, what is below adds no further information to that above.  If you disagree, please edit.  [[Dired X]] doesn't seem to be necessary.

Put <code>(require 'dired-x)</code> in your <code>~/.emacs</code>.

To do a search and replace on all *.c files in a directory and all its subdirs, do this:

  M-x find-dired RET /path/to/dir RET -name "*.c" RET

Then, mark all the files you want to mark with `m' (or any of the various other marking commands such as `% m' or `% g').

Use the `Q' key to query replace in marked files.
