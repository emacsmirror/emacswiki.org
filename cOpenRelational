*How to*

If you execute 'c-open-relational-file' when current buffer is 'test.h' and 'Open-Type' is 1, current buffer switches C source file('test.c')
And, if current buffer is 'test.c' and 'Open-Type' is 1, current buffer switches C header file('test.h')
You can select 1 or 2 for 'Open-Type'. If type is 1, current buffer switches relational file's buffer, and if type is 2, 
emacs splits window horizontally and the buffer on other-window switches relational file's buffer.
This supports c and c++.
