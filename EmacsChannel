The official IRC channel for GNU Emacs is '''#emacs''' on [https://libera.chat/ Libera Chat] (a new network set up by the former freenode staff).  Connect by pointing your IRC client to irc.libera.chat:6697 (TLS). 

There are several IRC clients available for Emacs - see the client section of [[InternetRelayChat]] for options.

= About #emacs and related channels =

The Libera.Chat [[IRC]] channel '''#emacs''' is a place where people can ask questions and hang out with other Emacs folks.

The chatter is in English and EmacsLisp, but other flavours of Lisp and French, Finnish, German, Hindi, Portuguese, Swedish, Icelandic, Tagalog, Persian, and who knows what else are heard from time to time.  Pour les francophones, allez voir aussi SalleEmacsFr. Para la gente hispanoparlante, tambi√©n vea CanalEmacsEs. See EmacsChannelDemographics to get a sense of who's on the channel.

Public logging of the Emacs channel is forbidden.  (See EmacsChannelLogging.)

= Tips for getting help =

* Don't ask to ask - just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help. So, instead of saying something like "Can I ask a question about Org?" or "Does anyone use linum-mode?", jump straight into your question.
* People often hang out in #emacs and have off-topic conversations. Don't worry - if you want to ask Emacs-related questions, you're in the right place. Just go ahead and ask your question. If people think they can help you, they'll reply in the channel.
* If you need to share code that's more than one or two lines long, use a service such as gist.github.com instead of pasting the code directly into the channel.
* You may want to check the [[CommunityEmacsFAQ|Community FAQ]] and other resources for [[GetHelp|getting help]] before asking questions on the channel.

[:Conduct]
= Conduct =

In addition to [https://libera.chat/policies Libera.Chat's network-wide policies], we have some of our own rules (some of which are redundant):

* Treat people with respect. No sexism, racism, homophobia, or discrimination against other conditions or factors. Don't be a jerk. Don't put other people down, insult them, or threaten them. If you like teasing people or using sarcasm, please be aware that other people may not know the context or may not be able to read your intent. Avoid that kind of ambiguous communication if possible, or clarify if asked.
* Be patient. You might not get an answer right away. People are not actively watching the channel all the time. If no one knows the answer to your question, you might not get a response at all. You don't need to repeat the question or ask if people have seen it. While waiting for someone to reply to your question, you might want to participate in other questions, investigate other ways of [[GetHelp|getting help]], or focus on other things. Check back occasionally to see if someone has responded to you.
* Be friendly to newbies. They might not know what things are called or where to look for help, so you may want to suggest links or keywords to help them learn more.
* Don't start or participate in flame wars. If a discussion gets out of hand, feel free to use ##/ignore##. If an off-topic discussion gets heated or starts to drown out on-topic discussion, please take it elsewhere. If a discussion disrupts Emacs-related help, bring it to the attention of a channel operator. See the [[#LawAndOrder|Law and Order]] section below. 
* You don't need to change your IRC nick to indicate that you are away. A simple ##/away## message will be enough.

Violators of this code of conduct may be temporarily or permanently banned from the channel.

[:LawAndOrder]
= Law and Order =

If you need the help of a channel *operator* (usually for kicking and banning obnoxious fellow channel members), you can get a list of these from fsbot. Just say:

    ops?

To call the ops, use ##ops <nick-to-complain-about> [reason]##. Make sure you have a clear reason for getting in touch with the ops, such as code of conduct violations.

In the background the Libera.Chat servers maintain an *access list* for the channel.  Try it for yourself:

    /msg chanserv flags #emacs

!ChanServ will reply with a list of people who have some sort of power on the channel. These are the important flags:

* Anybody with the +t flag may change the *topic* (although topic lock is almost always off)
* Anybody with the +o flag is a potential *operator*

The most powerful flag is the *founder* flag (+F).  Currently (2021 May 26) [[bandali]] has it.

If you're in trouble:

* To complain about a fellow channel member, talk to an operator (+o flag).
* To appeal decisions made by an operator, find another operator.
* If nothing else works, you'll have to contact Libera.Chat staff on #libera.

ops can add themselves using ##,ops-list is also <nick>##


= Bots =

The channel is probably logged by a gazillion bots (and human users).  Some of the bots one might encounter are described below.

In addition to addressing the bots like any other person, by prefixing the message with the recipients nickname and a colon, the bots understand a variety of special syntax among the traffic.  For example, fsbot parses strings surrounded by pairs of double commas.

The bots generally provide help if you ask them for it.  Better do that in private though, to keep it off the channel.

'''[::fsbot]'''

Fsbot, an instance of ErBot, is the simplest to use.  It has pointers to nearly all the pages on this wiki, among massive amounts of other usefulness.  Fsbot commands start with an initial comma.  It's cunning enough to respond to other syntaxes too.

    <kensanata> ,setfonts
    <fsbot> me thinks SetFonts is at
        http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SetFonts

'''[::rudybot]'''

[[offby1]] runs this bot in the channel. Its sole useful feature is using http://tinyurl.com to convert long URLs to short ones.  Other features, only arguably useful, include entertaining its author; spewing random quotes on demand; a "seen" feature similar to birny's; and a Scheme evaluator (handy for confusing Lisp novices who are unclear about the difference between Emacs Lisp and Scheme).  Its source lives at https://github.com/offby1/rudybot.

= Off-topic conversations =

After spending some time on the channel, one's mind might start suspecting the EmacsChannelPeople are mere slackers, doing little else than idling on their beloved channel.  The EmacsChannelDemographics certainly proves such accusations downright rubbish.  These "slackers" come from all aspects of life and are involved a vast range of most Useful Things indeed.  Besides they're so busy doing their Useful Things, they have only time to idle on the channel, and not chit-chat all day long.  Many have even automated the joining process (f.ex. ErcEmacsChannel), to minimize the distraction.  If the channel does seem rather quiet at times, a gentle stir usually attracts audience.

It would be naive to think only strictly Emacs-related issues were discussed on the channel, especially on a channel where 'strict' itself is such an unpopular idea.  At times discussions, especially about politics, can get rather carried away as we all so well know.  It might be best to take it to the IdeologiesChannel when that happens.  All in all, the Emacsfolks being such a well-behaved lots, there isn't much to EmacsChannelMaintenance beyond fighting EmacsChannelHarassment.

= What happened to the channel on freenode? =

This community used to be on freenode, but this was taken over by the new freenode staff on May 25 2021 UTC and shut down as part of a larger hostile takeover of the freenode network (see [https://www.kline.sh/ freenode now belongs to Andrew Lee, and I'm leaving for a new network] and [https://mastodon.sdf.org/@kline/106299403921451814 andrew lee just seized over 700 channels on freenode because they mentioned libera.chat in their topic]), prompting the community of '''#emacs''' to migrate.

The '''#emacs''' channel on freenode is now run by the new freenode staff, and no longer has anything to do with the community that was previously on freenode.

= Some notes on cross-posting =

These are some **informal** notes and thoughts on cross-posting on IRC channels gathered from the crazy whiz kids in #emacs. It is placed here as a reference since the internet does not seem to have any information on the topic.

A simple definition of cross-posting would 'posting exactly the same message on multiple channels'.

While cross-posting is maybe common on platforms like Reddit (where there is often some kind of notification that the post has been cross-posted), and perhaps not an issue in itself :- the following notes are more relevant to #emacs and #org-mode channels on IRC. These channels are more intimately 'connected' both in terms of common users and questions. These notes are more about the problems of 'instantly' cross-posting across these channels at the same time, and why this specific kind of cross-posting is probably not the best practice to follow.

Issues:

* Cross-posting leads to potential duplication of conversations and effort.

* It can also potentially facilitate asynchronous, fragmented and contradictory input, thus reducing the overall efficiency of the discussion, and end up confusing the person who asked the question.

* If someone answers the question in one channel, the cross-poster may often tend to fail to update the other channel. Subsequently someone else may see this unanswered question in the other channel, and start considering how to answer, actually answer, and then is finally told that it has already been answered.

* A number of users just don't want to see the same question twice, at same second, with no warning.

* Cross-posting also treats what is basically a collection of social settings as though they were somebody's personal tech support. The attitude of "I'll just blast this question to several different places and hope for an answer from one of them" seems reasonable until you remember you're possibly asking many people to donate time to hold your hand, while putting in no effort yourself to avoid this.

Suggestions:

* If there is a need to cross-post in order to increase 'reach' and invite more feedback, it would be nice if the poster mentions that they are cross-posting, and also update the channel X that the discussion thread has taken off or the question has been answered in channel Y.

* As of today, #emacs tends to have significantly more users and activity than #org-mode. This is a multi-edged phenomenon as it could mean that your question is lost in the chatter of #emacs, or that it could be answered a lot more quickly! Since #org-mode is quieter, there is the chance that your question is more 'visible', but is answered at a later time.
