;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Narrow using an indirect buffer that is a clone of the current
;;  buffer (which becomes the base buffer for the clone).
;;
;;  Such an indirect buffer gives you a different view of a portion of
;;  the buffer, or even of the whole buffer (use `C-x h C-x 4 n n').
;;  It always has the same text and text properties, but otherwise it
;;  is pretty independent.
;;
;;  In particular, you can kill an indirect buffer without affecting
;;  its base buffer.  You will likely want to kill indirect narrowed
;;  buffers rather than widening them.
;;
;;  You can use indirect buffers for more than you might think.  You
;;  can use clones taken from portions of Dired buffers, for example,
;;  to give you useful (active) views into a directory listing.  There
;;  are only a few keys/commands (such as `g' to update the listing)
;;  that do not work, because they depend on a view of the whole Dired
;;  buffer.  Experiment, and you will no doubt find interesting new
;;  uses for indirect buffers.
;;
;;  Note: Because an indirect clone shares text properties with its
;;  base buffer, if you give it a different major mode that uses
;;  different font-locking then the font-locking of the base buffer
;;  changes the same way.  However, you can restore the font-locking
;;  appropriate to the base buffer, by just toggling `font-lock-mode'
;;  off and on again there.
;;
;;  See the Emacs manual, node `Indirect Buffers'.
;;
;;  It is helpful to be able to easily distinguish indirect buffers
;;  from non-indirect buffers.  This library offers two ways to do
;;  this, for the indirect buffers it creates:
;;
;;  * The buffer name of an indirect narrowed buffer starts with a
;;    prefix that you can set using option `ni-buf-name-prefix'.  The
;;    default value is `I-'.
;;
;;  * The name of an indirect narrowed buffer is highlighted in the
;;    mode line using face `ni-mode-line-buffer-id' instead of face
;;    `mode-line-buffer-id'.  To turn this off, just customize the
;;    former to be the same as the latter.
;;
;;  By default, the name of an indirect narrowed buffer reflects the
;;  name of its base buffer and the text of the narrowed region (or
;;  the name of the defined object, in the case of
;;  `ni-narrow-to-defun-indirect-other-window').  But you can control
;;  this in several ways.  See the command doc strings and user
;;  options `ni-buf-name-prefix', `ni-narrowed-buf-name-max', and
;;  `ni-buf-name-separator'.
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 24.4 or later then invisible buffer text is
;;  filtered out from the name of the indirect buffer.  For example,
;;  if you invoke `ni-narrow-to-region-indirect-other-window' with an
;;  active region in a Dired buffer that is hiding details, then the
;;  (invisible) details will not be included in the indirect-buffer
;;  name.
;;
;;  To customize the behavior of this library, do this:
;;
;;    M-x customize-group Narrow-Indirect
;;
;;  Suggested key bindings:
;;
;;   (define-key ctl-x-4-map "nd" 'ni-narrow-to-defun-indirect-other-window)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-4-map "nn" 'ni-narrow-to-region-indirect-other-window)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-4-map "np" 'ni-narrow-to-page-indirect-other-window)
;;
;;
;;  User options defined here:
;;
;;    `ni-buf-name-prefix', `ni-narrowed-buf-name-max',
;;    `ni-buf-name-separator'.
;;
;;  Faces defined here:
;;
;;    `ni-mode-line-buffer-id'.
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `ni-narrow-to-defun-indirect-other-window',
;;    `ni-narrow-to-page-indirect-other-window',
;;    `ni-narrow-to-region-indirect-other-window'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `ni-buffer-substring-collapsed-visible',
;;    `ni--put-mode-line-buf-id-face'.
;;
;;  Acknowledgments:
;;
;;   The idea and original code for a command that combines narrowing
;;   with cloning a buffer as an indirect-buffer is due to Zane Ashby:
;;   https://demonastery.org/2013/04/emacs-narrow-to-region-indirect/.
;;
;;   In Emacs bug thread #17401, Phil Sainty proposed adding three
;;   commands to Emacs based on this approach.  Lennart Borgman
;;   contributed code that uses, in the cloned buffer name, some text
;;   based on the narrowed region.
;;
;;   The code in `narrow-indirect.el' extends this a bit and provides
;;   a couple of user options and some alternative (prefix-argument)
;;   behavior.  It is doubtful that Emacs Dev will ever adopt features
;;   such as those defined here, and if they do then this library can
;;   at least help for Emacs versions prior to their addition.
