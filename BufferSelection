This page is about the bs library, which provides a comfortable way to switch buffers. It is part of Emacs.  Also known as [::bs] and [::BSBufferSelection].

Here's how to install it:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'bs-show)

It has font-locking, and various configurations.

Here are two configurations to limit the list of buffers to just channels or to just buffers that have a default target (ie. channels and queries for nicks in [[ERC]]:

    (require 'bs)
    (add-to-list 'bs-configurations
                 '("channels" nil nil "^[^#]" nil nil))
    (add-to-list 'bs-configurations
                 '("targets" nil nil nil
                   (lambda (buf)
                      (with-current-buffer buf
                        (not (erc-default-target)))) nil))

And here is a configuration to limit the list of buffers to SQL-related stuff (cf. SqlMode):

    (add-to-list 'bs-configurations
                 '("SQL" nil nil nil
                   (lambda (buf)
                      (with-current-buffer buf
                         (not (memq major-mode
                            '(sql-interactive-mode sql-mode))))) nil))

And here is one for all your dired buffers (before calling kill-all-dired-buffers from KillingBuffers, for example):

    (add-to-list 'bs-configurations
                 '("dired" nil nil nil
                   (lambda (buf)
                     (with-current-buffer buf
                       (not (eq major-mode 'dired-mode)))) nil))

If you are using GnuClient, then you will notice that you cannot kill
buffers from the selection using `d'.  The reason is that
server-kill-buffer has a subtle bug that will return nil even if the
killing of the buffer was successful.  Here is some code to
fix it:

    (fset 'kill-buffer 'my-server-kill-buffer)
    
    (defun my-server-kill-buffer (buffer)
      "Call `server-kill-buffer' but make sure to return the correct value."
      (interactive "bKill buffer ")
      (server-kill-buffer (get-buffer buffer))
      (not (buffer-name (get-buffer buffer))))

= Problems, questions and hopefully some answers too =

== bs-dont-show-regexp ==
Setting the above variable to a regexp doesn't seem to do what I (mistakenly?)
believe it should: viz. not showing the buffers matched by the regexp. Even
though it is set from my .emacs, its value is nil when I `C-h v bs-dont-show-regexp RET'.
What am I missing/misunderstanding?

You should set `bs-configurations`, not `bs-dont-show-regexp`. This confused me too. --AmitPatel'''

Thank you. :)

* KillingBuffers, for an example of using '''Icicles''' to write a command to kill all Dired buffers. The same command also shows you all Dired buffers (via `S-TAB') -- no need for a separate Dired-buffers configuration.
