Stipple is a kind of pixle-toggling using a bitmap.  Gnus uses this,
for example, to insert a wonderful Gnus into the splash screen.

To illustrate this, the following code fragment creates a [[Face]] with a
stipple consisting of a 2x2 bitmap.  The top right and the bottom left
corner are set.  Tiling this bitmap gives a chess-board bitmap.

 (make-face 'foo)
 (set-face-stipple 'foo (list 2 2 (string 1 2)))

The following the inserts the string foobar into the buffer and adds
the stipple to the first three characters.  Evaluate this in a buffer
without font-lock (as font-lock removes all non-font-lock
TextProperties immediately).

 (let ((str "foobar"))
   (put-text-property 0 3 'face 'foo str)
   (insert str))

Apparently stipple is unsupported on Windows[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2009-01/msg00428.html]. -- AdamKerz

Also does not work with emacs-mac-port () on OSX (I have not tested the Emacs NextStep OSX build.) -- Jason Milkins
