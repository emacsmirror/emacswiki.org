Emacs can have a vertical '''[::scroll bar]''' in each [[window]].

In order to disable the display of scroll bars, add the following to your ~/.emacs file, for GnuEmacs:
{{{
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
}}}
or this, for [[XEmacs]]:

{{{
(set-specifier horizontal-scrollbar-visible-p nil)
(set-specifier vertical-scrollbar-visible-p nil)
}}}
----

`M-x scroll-bar-mode` toggles scroll bars in all [[Frame]]s. This is usually not what I want.
To turn on scrollbars on a per-frame basis instead, you can put this handy function in your InitFile:

    (defun scroll-bars-in-this-frame (&optional off)
      (interactive)
      (modify-frame-parameters (selected-frame)
 			   `((vertical-scroll-bars . ,(if off
							 nil
						       'left)))))

Or use `M-x toggle-scroll-bar'.

----

You can also set where the scroll bars should be. For GnuEmacs, use
one of the following:
{{{
(set-scroll-bar-mode 'right)   ; replace 'right with 'left to place it to the left
}}}

and for [[XEmacs]]:

{{{
(set-specifier scrollbar-on-left-p nil) ; replace nil with t to place it to the left
(set-specifier scrollbar-on-top-p nil) ; replace nil with t to place it on top
}}}
----
To use a colored scroll bar (good to have good constrast) you can ./configure gnu emacs with "--with-x-toolkit=motif"  See `system-configuration-options' variable to see how is your running emacs configured.

Apparently with only that toolkit you can 
(set-face-background'scroll-bar "red")

Alternatively, users of the GTK toolkit can style scrollbars by putting something like this in ~/.gtkrc-2.0:
<pre>
style "contrast"
{
        GtkScrollbar::has_forward_stepper  = 0
        GtkScrollbar::has_backward_stepper = 0
        bg[NORMAL]   = "red"
        bg[PRELIGHT] = "dark red"
}
class "GtkScrollbar" style "contrast"
</pre>
----

GnuEmacs can draw its own "native" scroll bars, which (contrary to the
above post) are quite customizable. In my opinion, this also gives the
best results for users of ColorTheme. Details follow: 

Build GnuEmacs with the following options passed to
`./configure`:
<pre>
--without-toolkit-scroll-bars --with-x-toolkit=no 
</pre>
Then try a ColorTheme, or: 
<pre>
M-x customize-face RET scroll-bar RET
</pre>
You can set the foreground/background colors, border color/width, etc.
There is a separate variable called scroll-bar-width.

Note: the default mouse behavior of the native scroll bar is not what
most people will expect. This doesn't bother me, because I never click
on the scroll bars anyway: instead I look to them for visual feedback
on my location in the buffer, and to see how much of the buffer is
exposed in the window. I use the MouseWheel or IncrementalSearch
when I want to move around in a buffer, and have never found much
reason to use the scroll bar for this.

However: the native scroll bar has its own keymap (try `C-h C-k`, then
click or drag on the scroll bar). I haven't yet tried this, but in
principle its response to mouse movements can be configured freely,
perhaps even to duplicate the behavior of the typical scroller.

Any thoughts?

The Windows/NT ./configure script cannot deal with <code>--without-toolkit-scroll-bars --with-x-toolkit=no</code>. Is there another way to tell emacs to use its own scrollbars? 
-- [[Zarza]]

[new]
try <code>./configure --without-toolkit-scroll-bars --with-x-toolkit=yes</code>
this way I get native scroll bars with whatever x-toolkit I want on my debian system. Maybe it works like that on windows NT too.

Is it possible to (de)activate the scrollbar only in one buffer? -- Michael

[new:DrewAdams:2010-07-03 21:40 UTC]
Nope.  You can request that this feature be added, however, via `M-x send-emacs-bug-report'. 

Scroll bars are used or not used for all windows of a frame.  The most you can do is turn scroll bars on/off for a given frame, using `toggle-scroll-bar'. -- DrewAdams
