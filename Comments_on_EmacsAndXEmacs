How can one determine whether the running Emacs is GNU Emacs or XEmacs?

Grepping for `xemacs' in the Emacs source code shows that this is the most common test: ##(featurep 'xemacs)##.

You're asking about ElispCompatibility.

Thanks for the information. I have added a link to ElispCompatibility to the footer of this page.
