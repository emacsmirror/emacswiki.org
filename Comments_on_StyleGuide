The following comment was made in an edit on EmacsNewbie:

Does a newbie need any more bulletpoints than necessary? Let's reformat this into more prose and less bullet points, to make this more coherent and less jarring.

I don't know how prose is always better than lists.  Itemized lists are pretty simple and good for navigation on the Web (and in [[Info]]!) and easier to maintain and likely translate.

The issue is more of the Wiki practice of referencing every page in a category, of which EmacsNewbie is one, rather than having a thoughtful navigation of the pages in a category.  "Writing as if you are talking to someone" is important.  It's not the only requirement for the Web though.

hello there and thank you for your info – I have certainly picked up anything new from right here.
I did however expertise a few technical issues using this web site,
since I experienced to reload the site a lot of times 
previous to I could get it to load properly. I had been wondering if 
your web hosting is OK? Not that I am complaining, but 
sluggish loading instances times will sometimes affect your placement in google and could damage 
your quality score if advertising and marketing with Adwords.
Anyway I'm adding this RSS to my email and could look out for much more of your 
respective interesting content. Ensure that you update this again very soon.
