The following comment was made in an edit on EmacsNewbie:

Does a newbie need any more bulletpoints than necessary? Let's reformat this into more prose and less bullet points, to make this more coherent and less jarring.

I don't know how prose is always better than lists.  Itemized lists are pretty simple and good for navigation on the Web (and in [[Info]]!) and easier to maintain and likely translate.

The issue is more of the Wiki practice of referencing every page in a category, of which EmacsNewbie is one, rather than having a thoughtful navigation of the pages in a category.  "Writing as if you are talking to someone" is important.  It's not the only requirement for the Web though.
