Emacs conveniently allows one to work on different parts of the same buffer at the same time, but the rules governing buffer display are, for some people's editing habits, less than ideal.  Suppose for example that one is editing two parts of buffer <i>buf</i> in windows <i>win-1</i> and <i>win-2</i>, switches briefly to another buffer in <i>win-2</i>, then returns to editing <i>buf</i> in <i>win-2</i>.  This latter window will now display the same part of <i>buf</i> as <i>win-1</i>, rather than the portion that one was just recently editing in it.  The package <tt>[[per-win.el]]</tt> (by [[AlpAker]]) creates persistent values of window-point and window-start, so that in cases like that just described <i>win-2</i> will return to its previous position in <i>buf</i>.

In some cases, as when another Lisp program wants to move point in a buffer and then display that buffer in a window, it makes sense for per-win not to position point in that window.  (For example, when looking up a function definition via `describe-function', point is moved to the function definition before the library that defines the function is displayed; we then don't want to move point away from the definition when the library is displayed.)  The package is reasonably intelligent in identifying situations in which it should defer to other Lisp programs.  It also provides a hook so that the user can define other types of exception.
