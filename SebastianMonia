After consuming the wiki for the last few months, I finally added something to the conversation.

Argentinian, living in the US. 
Former Windows user, .NET programmer. Converted to JavaScripter. Then converted to Pythonista. Common Lisper in progress. 
Using Linux wherever I can.

Researched my options for ditching Visual Studio back in 2016/2017 and settled on Emacs, which I fell in love with after two weeks of learning :)

you can find me on Twitter and GitHub as "sebasmonia" or email me at {username}@outlook.com
