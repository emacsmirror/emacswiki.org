I found that this program did not work for me. I modified it a little bit to actually correctly break when it found my signature. However I broke the feature that it seems to want to have of saving your /last/ signature.

;;; |$Date: 1997/04/18 09:14:51 $|$Revision: 1.7 $|~/packages/mail-signature.el

;;; Commentary:

;;; This is a reworking of the function mail-signature in sendmail.el
;;; (part of the Emacs distribution) to insert a context sensitive signature.
;;; Using regular expressions, appropriate signatures can be inserted 
;;; for different audiences.
;;; Repeated calls removes the current signature from the message and cycles
;;; through all applicable signatures.
;;; Use with something like this in .emacs:
;;; (eval-after-load "sendmail"
;;;   (progn
;;;     (load "mail-signature")
;;;     (setq mail-signature-alist 
;;;           (append '(("To" "friend" "-friendly")) mail-signature-alist))))
;;; And create a file called ~/.signature-friendly that has a
;;; signature appropriate for the user `friend' to receive.
;;; If using message-mode (included with Emacs 19.34/GNUS 5.3 or later)
;;; (setq message-signature 'mail-signature)
