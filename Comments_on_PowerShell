Just beginning to collect resources.  I couldn't archive copies of these files into the ElispArea, as there is no copyright info in either of them! -- PatrickAnderson

FYI, there are copies of these files in [[EmacsW32]] (which I am going to upload to Launchpad when I get time).

I've updated Powershell.el, with a copyright and proper license, as well as some tightening of the code.

Hi Dino. I upgraded to the latest version 0.2.1 from 0.1. The new version seems to have this problem. Start powershell, then close buffer. Then, when you start standard shell, it no longer have prompts, and is in fact running powershell, not bash or cmd.ex. -- [[Xah Lee]], 2010 June 24

Hi Xah. I'll have to look into that. I've been out-of-the-office for an extended period, so I'm catching up on some old stuff.  Will look into this and get back to you here. -- DinoChiesa, 2010 Nov 13

== Emacs 23.1 ==

[new]
When I ran it on emacs 23.1 it would fail with "invalid argument, looking for stringp got nil" (to that effect) on 
{{{
    (if (string-match (concat "^" powershell-prompt-regex "\\(.*\\)\\'")
                       powershell-command-reply)
}}}
I changed the if statement to skip if power-shell-command-reply is null, and set it to "", still get a startup error but it works (normally as far as I can tell but I'm not sure if I'm missing any highlighting I'm supposed to get.  Here's my workaround
{{{
        (if (and (not (null powershell-command-reply))
		    (string-match (concat "^" powershell-prompt-regex "\\(.*\\)\\'")
                             powershell-command-reply))
               (setq powershell-command-reply
                     (substring powershell-command-reply
                                (match-beginning 1)
                                (match-end 1)))
	     (setq powershell-command-reply "")
	     )
}}}
