[[es:MheEs]]

'''MH-E''' is the Emacs frontend to '''MH''' (the //Rand Mail Handler//).

MH is a ''mail user agent'' (MUA) for the unix shell.
Instead of being one monolithic program, it is a collection of small tools, which makes it easy to use and maintain.

== Usage ==

This short example uses:

* `nmh' - the most popular MH implementation
* `msmtp' - For sending mail via SMTP
* `MH-E' - As the client used to manage your mail

Disclaimer: The `inc' command, used in this tutorial, will //delete// the files from your remote inbox after downloading them to your computer. Keep this in mind.

=== nmh ===

To use MH-E, you will need MH on your computer. The most popular implementation of MH is `nmh', which you should be able to install from your package manager.

Once you have nmh, you will need to create a file in your home directory named <code>.mh_profile</code>, that looks like this:

{{{
Path: mail
Local-Mailbox: Me <me@example.com>
send: -mts sendmail/pipe -sendmail /usr/bin/msmtp
inc: -host mail.example.com -user me@example.com
}}}

* `Path' - Where MH looks for, and stores, email. Relative to the <code>~/.mh_profile</code> file.
* `Local-Mailbox' - Your "From:" field
* `send' - How mail is sent. We tell nmh to send mail with sendmail, but we specify msmtp as our sendmail program.
* `inc' - Our POP account, so MH can download mail directly from the remote server.

If you would like `inc' to store your password, create a file named `~/.netrc' that contains:

{{{
machine    mail.example.com
  login    me@example.com
  password p4ssw0rd
}}}

=== msmtp ===

'''msmtp''' is a //Mail Transfer Agent// (MTA), which is used to send mail via SMTP. You should be able to install the `msmtp' package from your computer's package manager.

Create the file <code>~/.msmtp</code>, which contains something like this:

{{{
account  main
port     587
tls      on
host     mail.example.com
from     me@example.com

auth     on
user     me@example.com
password p4ssw0rd

account default : main
}}}

* `account' - The name of our profile (can be anything)
* `port' - The SMTP port
* `tls' - Use TLS (required by some SMTP servers)
* `host' - The address of our SMTP server
* `from' - Our email address
* `auth' - We're using a username/password
* `user' - The username of our account
* `password' - Our email password
* `account default' - Which account to use (in this case, "main")

Now that SMTP is configured via msmtp, we can send mail!

=== MH-E ===

Start MH-E from Emacs with <code>M-x mh-nmail</code>. This will open your MH inbox.

You can control mh-nmail with the following keys:

* `i' - Get new mail (with the 'inc' command)
* `o' - Move message to another folder
* `r' - Reply to current message
* `s' - Start writing a new email
* `F v' - Visit another folder
* `n/p' - Next / previous message in current folder
* <code>?</code> - See a small help menu.

= About the documentation =

MH-E has its own InfoMode documentation which comes with Emacs. The most recent version
is 8.0 which is now being kept in sync with the released version of the
software. [http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=566555]

In many MH-E submodes, pressing <code>?</code> provides a quick list of keybindings.

There is also the book by Jerry Peek: <i>[https://rand-mh.sourceforge.io/book/ MH & nmh: Email for Users & Programmers]</i>.

= Further Configuration =

The ##.mh_profile## file is the default MH configuration file, and can be used to set many different MH variables. Changes made here will effect all MH frontends.

In MH-E, you can see all the customization options by running: ##M-x customize-group mh-e##. This will open a CustomizingAndSaving interface.

To set MH-E as your default mail client, you can add the following to init.el:

{{{
(setq
 mail-user-agent 'mh-e-user-agent
 read-mail-command 'mh-nmail)
}}}

= Multiple Accounts & Gmail =

For this tutorial, you'll need the following programs installed:

* nmh
* fetchmail
* msmtp
                              
When you have multiple mail addresses, msmtp reads the ##From:## field and uses the corresponding account. msmtp should be built with the ##WITH_GNUTLS=YES## flag.

##.emacs##:

{{{
(setq mh-send-uses-spost-flag t)
(setq mail-user-agent 'mh-e-user-agent)
}}}

##/etc/nmh/mts.conf##:

{{{
sendmail: /home/username/.msmtp-envelope-from.sh
mts: sendmail
masquerade: draft_from
}}}

##.msmtp-envelope-from.sh##:

{{{
#!/bin/sh

# can't write "sendmail: /usr/local/bin/msmtp --read-envelope-from"
# in mts.conf, so here's a little workaround.
# Make msmtp read the "From:" field and to use that account:

/usr/local/bin/msmtp --read-envelope-from $*
}}}

##.mh_profile##:

{{{
Path: Mail
postproc: /usr/local/libexec/nmh/spost
}}}

##.fetchmailrc##:

{{{
poll pop.yandex.ru with proto POP3
  user 'username' password 'userpass'
    
poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3
  user 'username' password 'userpass' options ssl
  sslcertck sslcertpath /home/banan/.certs/
}}}

##.msmtp##:

{{{
# username@yandex.ru
account yandex
host     smtp.yandex.ru
from     username@yandex.ru
auth     login
user     username
password userpass
 
# username@gmail.com
account  gmail
host     smtp.gmail.com
port     587
from     username@gmail.com
auth     on
user     username@gmail.com
password userpass
tls      on

tls_trust_file /home/banan/.certs/ThawtePremiumServerCA.crt
}}}

Now, in the ##~/Mail## folder, you'll edit the following files:

* components
* replcomps
* forwcomps

In each of these files, right before the ##To:## line, add ##From: Me <username@gmail.com>##. Now we can select an account by editing the ##From:## field in your //compose// buffer!

[https://www.verisign.com/support/thawte-roots.zip The certificates (zipped)]

When certificates are in ##~/.certs/##, do ##$ c_rehash ~/.certs/##

= Add-ons =

MhBiff ([http://www.yynet.tama.tokyo.jp/~yokota/mh-biff/ Website])is a mail-notification tool. MhCrypt,
(Lisp:mh-crypt.el) is an utility to store the messages in an encrypted
format.  With a quick glance it seems this would break mh outside of
MH-E.

= Alternative to MhBiff =

For those who do not understand japanese well, there is another way to get mail notification: (display-time) function with some tweaks (useful in case of multiple mail folders)

{{{
;; Notification stuff: use display-time minor mode to notify about new mail
;; in mode-line, but omit time and load info. Print comma separated list
;; of folders with new mail in mode-line.

(setq
 display-time-interval 10
 display-time-format ""
 display-time-default-load-average nil
 display-time-mail-face 'custom-themed

 display-time-mail-function
 (lambda ()
   (let ((input (shell-command-to-string "/usr/bin/flist -all"))
	 (dirs nil)
	 (start 0))
     (while (string-match "^\\([a-z-+]*\\) *has [1-9].*$" input start)
       (push (match-string 1 input) dirs)
       (setq start (match-end 0)))
     (setq display-time-mail-string (mapconcat 'identity dirs ", ")))))

(display-time)
}}}

= Other MH Clients =

Aside from Emacs' MH-E, you can control MH through various shell commands (see
the manpages for '''nmh''' and '''mh-chart''')

Then there are the GUI clients, '''xmh''' and exmh, written in
Tcl%%/%%Tk.

There's another Emacs interface called '''tmh''', written by ThienThiNguyen, but
since it hasn't been updated since late 1994. It has been archived at the
author's webpage.
