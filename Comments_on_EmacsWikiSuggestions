== ALT Multiple commands on a single key stroke ==

An example of a simple solution to mapping a chain of commands to a single key stroke:
<code>
(setq newline-under-current-line "\C-e\C-o")
(global-set-key "\C-i" newline-under-current-line)
</code>

Wait, what? What does ''ALT Multiple commands on a single key stroke'' that have to do with anything on EmacsWikiSuggestions ?

Maybe it should be moved to EmacsNiftyTricks?

Where is the appropriate place to leave a suggestion for some entries discussing how to create a right-click context menu?  It should not have been necessary for me to have reverse engineered Aquamacs to figure out something so simple:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16454838/yasnippet-how-to-create-a-right-click-context-menu-popup-menu

Googling "emacs right-click context menu" should pull up a page on EmacsWiki describing how to do this.

I'd suggest a new page to be linked from CategoryMenus. I guess adding a new section to EasyMenu won't achieve the googleability you're looking for.

It's not clear that the topic "right-click menu" or "context menu" or similar, would or should point especially to pages about ''how to create'' such a menu.

Googling for ##emacswiki "right-click"## shows lots of hits that are appropriate, depending on what you are looking for, because there are lots of different right-click menus mentioned on the wiki. 

I have nothing against Alex's suggestion of adding a CategoryMenus page, but googling will still show such a how-to page, especially one that is specific for Aquamacs, as only one "right-click menu" or "context menu" hit among many for this wiki.  The category entry will be helpful, however, for discovery/access via the CategoryMenus page.
