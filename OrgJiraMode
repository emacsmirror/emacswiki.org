==1 Introduction ==

[http://orgmode.org Org-mode] is the best GTD (get things done) tool I have used. If you didn't use it, please consider give it a shot.

Jira is, well, a very popular Bug Tracking system. Two companies in a row where I worked chose Jira for bug tracking, task management, etc.

As an emacs enthusiast, I very much want to be able to use Jira within Emacs. Thus I started digging the web for a solution.

To use Jira without the browser, you can use a) xmp-rpc, b) soap, c) REST. I don't know what the last one is, but their supported degree by Jira is in ascending order. The former 2 protocols has both been supported by Emacs plugin: [https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el xml-rpc] and [http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/ soap].

For xml-rpc, there is already a [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/org-jira.el jira.el], but it is not satisfactory for me:

* xml-rpc is not as well supported as soap by Jira.
* jira.el is a stand-alone tool, while I want to integrate with org-mode.

Luckily, the emacs-soap-client guy(s) already provided a sample jira2.el, so I started hacking by combining jira.el and jira2.el, the new jira2.el is [http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/.emacs_d/org-jira/jira2.el here].

After browsing Jira with jira2.el is implemented, I checked [https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog org2blog] for ideas of how to hack on org-mode, and started from his org2blog.el and hacked into a new [http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/raw/master/.emacs_d/org-jira/org-jira.el org-jira.el].

==2 Features ==

===2.1 Sync Jira tickets into Org-mode todo items in a batch mode. ===

Jira ticket attributes such as priority, status, resolution, summary, description, etc. are supported. New ones can be added if desired by hacking the elisp.

See the following example. Jira ticket summary has been used as the Org TODO headline; most Jira ticket attributes have been made into Org entry; Jira description attribute is made into a separate subtitle because unlike most attributes it is multi-line.

* TODO test summary                                          :SANDBOX_22:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :assignee: hjbao
  :reporter: hjbao
  :type:     Bug
  :priority: Major
  :status:   Open
  :ID:       SANDBOX-22
  :END:

** description: SANDBOX-22
test description
** Comment: Bao Haojun
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       21322
   :END:
test comment

Also note the ID Org entry, both the Jira issue and Jira comment has an attribute ideal for this entry. Org-mode has an API for finding heading from ID entry.

===2.2 Update Org-mode new edits back to Jira ===

After you edit the attributes, such as change priority from "Major" to "Minor", you can post it back the Jira.

===2.3 Create new Jira issue in org mode ===

You can create new Jira issue within org mode. You will be prompted for Jira ticket information such as create in which project, assign to whom, and one-line summary, etc.

===2.4 Convert existing org mode TODO item into Jira ticket ===

This one is similar to the create-new-issue case, except the existing TODO headline can be used for Jira ticket summary.

===2.5 Edit existing Jira comments / add new comment ===

These are also supported.

==3 Usage ==

To use org-jira.el, you need download all the .el files under [http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config/tree/master/.emacs_d/org-jira org-jira].

(You can get the soap files from emacs-soap project, but I fixed an utf-8 encoding bug in it so that I can post comments in Chinese).

(setq jira2-url "http://jira-host")
(require 'jira2)
(require 'org-jira)
