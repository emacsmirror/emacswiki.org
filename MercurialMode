[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial Mercurial], also known as hg, is yet another distributed version control system.  It's written in Python and includes "mercurial.el" using VC.

vc-hg.el is part of Emacs since version 22.2 (released March 2008).

DistributedVersionControl supports Mercurial.

Another Mercurial mode can be found at http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/file/tip/contrib/mercurial.el.  It's being developed under [[XEmacs]].

There's another Mercurial mode, aHg, at https://es.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ahg.html .

If you like using Magit for Git, you will find it interesting to work with [https://github.com/ananthakumaran/monky Monky] - Magit for Hg.
