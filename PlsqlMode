== Programming support for PL/SQL code ==

PL/SQL mode is an extension of SqlMode that provides supports writing
PL/SQL code.  It uses SqlMode to provide keyword fontification,
symbol-tables, and interaction with the database.

Note: Most of its features should be provided by the combination of SqlMode with SqlIndent, nowadays.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to fixing some bugs, this mode also provides the following:

* A Fast and sophisticated indentation function `plsql-indent' (normally bound to TAB) which can help to present (and maintain) complex code in a readable form.

* Imenu support which allows you to jump to specific modules using either the "Contents" menu or speedbar.

* Align support which allows you to automatically "beautify" code as you write by aligning certain constructs e.g. `align-current' will align all =, :=, and => tokens in the current paragraph.  XEmacs users may have to get a copy of the align package to use this feature.

The lastest version is available here:

* Lisp:plsql.el

I just started using this, looks pretty nice. The indent only sort of works though, but at least it's better than sqldeveloper's.
