See SubprocessCompletion for the background to this.

To use this simply bind "spbc-readline-tab" to your TAB key in the relevant modes (eg shell / rlogin etc)

NB, (should probably integrate with the default comint-dynamic-complete at some point)....

Still need to upload this code properly (rather than have it as a page) when it's a bit more refined. But hopefully it could save some else some time if they've been wrestling with the same problem.


    ;; This file provides sub-process based completion
    ;; as-opposed to normal completion which emacs handles itself
    ;; This can be useful because sometimes the subprocess (eg a remote shell)
    ;; can provide more accurate completion facilities
