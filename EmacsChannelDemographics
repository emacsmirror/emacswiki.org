This page describes the demographics (nationality and occupation) of irc.libera.chat:#emacs.

Since '''#emacs''' is known for discussions of "nearly everything else but
Emacs", it is useful to know occupations and area of expertise so we
know where to go for authoritative answers.

This is also an attempt to see if there is a common thread amongst Emacs
users that hang out on '''#emacs'''.  So far, the diversity is more obvious
than the commonality.
