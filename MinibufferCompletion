Emacs's built-in minibuffer completion provides support when users provide input via the [[minibuffer]].

It is used with `M-x', `C-x b', `C-x C-f', and many other commands that prompt for input.

There are various standard options for input CompletionStyles.  Additionally, the packages mentioned below provide extensive support of different kinds.

===Official documentation===
* [[Manual:completion]] (concept) in the EmacsManual
* [[Manual:Minibuffer Completion]] (elisp) in the EmacsLispReference

===Built-in packages===
* CompletingRead -- EmacsLisp function `completing-read' and similar.
* IcompleteMode -- Fast minibuffer selection.
* InteractivelyDoThings ("Ido") -- Input completion without having to hit `TAB'.

===External packages===
These packages or sets of complementary packages extend or enhance minibuffer completion. They are often referred to as ''completion frameworks''.
* [[Icicles]] -- ''Cycle'' among candidate default input values, according to their type. [[regexp|Regexp]] matching, in addition to standard prefix matching.  Carry out ''actions'' on input candidates; manipulate ''sets'' of candidates. Icicles [[completion]] works the same for any kind of input -- [[command]]s, buffer names, file names, [[key sequence]]s, whatever. There are also specific commands for [[bookmark]]s, [[buffer]]s, files, color themes, doc, fonts, [[face]]s, colors, search targets... Define input-matching behavior specific to your application.
* [[Helm]] -- Completion framework with many available modules.
* [[IvyCounselSwiper]] -- Minimalist, simple, customizable. Tries to help with discoverability.
* [[VerticoConsultMarginaliaOrderlessEmbark]] - Completion framework composed of separate modular packages.
