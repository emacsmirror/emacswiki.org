The Emacs Lisp List ([::ELL]) is a list of Emacs packages that was created and formerly maintained by StephenEglen.

//Warning: the ELL has not been actively maintained for many years.  Even as of 2012-01-13 more than 50% of the URLs in it were either dead, non-responding or moved.//

StephenEglen wrote that he hopes "most people will start using the various packaging systems (such as [[ELPA]] or [[MELPA]]) instead for modern elisp."

Feel free to create new pages on this wiki to discuss packages in the
ELL.

A '''copy''' is available on this wiki.  See WikifiedEmacsLispList.
It makes no sense the edit the
WikifiedEmacsLispList! The real ELL by Stephen continues to be the
"leading" collection of links.  If there are any mistakes in the
wikified list, mail Stephen directly.  If you feel that the wikified
list is really outdated, you are invited to re-wikify it.

    I'm happy to continue updating the ELL, after all I probably receive
    just 2-3 emails a week suggesting changes/broken links, so it is not
    such a huge load for me at the moment.  Perhaps the wiki would be
    better suited if the ELL was more rapidly changing, but it seems
    pretty slow-changing at the moment.

I run the following script from a cronjob to copy it.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
ell-to-wiki.pl | wikiput \
    -s 'copy from the master site' \
    -u 'EmacsLispList' \
    'http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/WikifiedEmacsLispList'
</pre>

You can find wikiput on the Oddmuse site. [http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/wiki/wikiput]
You'll need [[ell-to-wiki.pl]], too.
