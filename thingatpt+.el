;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `thingatpt.el'
;;              has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `number-at-point' (Emacs 25+).
;;
;;  A REMINDER (the doc strings are not so great):
;;
;;    These functions, defined in `thingatpt.el', all move point:
;;      `beginning-of-thing', `end-of-sexp', `end-of-thing',
;;      `forward-symbol', `forward-thing'.
;;
;;  For older Emacs releases that do not have the following functions,
;;  they are defined here as no-ops:
;;
;;  `constrain-to-field', `field-beginning', `field-end'.
;;
;;
;;  How To Use This Library
;;  =======================
;;
;;  End Users
;;  ---------
;;
;;  Load this library after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `thingatpt.el'.  You can put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'):
;;
;;    (eval-after-load 'thingatpt '(require 'thingatpt+))
;;
;;  (If you use Emacs 20, where the first arg to `eval-after-load'
;;  must be a file name, then use the appropriate file name for
;;  thingatpt.el.  See `C-h f eval-after-load' for arg FILE.)
;;
;;  That defines new functions and improved versions of some of the
;;  standard thing-at-point functions.  All such functions have the
;;  prefix `tap-', so they are not used by default in any way.
;;
;;  Requiring library `thingatpt+.el' does not, however, make Emacs
;;  use the improved functions.  Merely loading it does not change the
;;  behavior of thing-at-point features.
;;
;;  If you want functions defined here to be used for calls to
;;  standard Emacs functions that make use of the `thing-at-point' and
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' symbol properties for standard thing
;;  types (e.g. `list'), then put this in your init file, instead:
;;
;;    (eval-after-load 'thingatpt
;;      '(when (require 'thingatpt+)
;;         (tap-put-thing-at-point-props))
;;
;;  Note that some of my other libraries, including Icicles,
;;  Bookmark+, `grep+.el', `replace+.el', and `strings.el', do exactly
;;  that.  Note too that `tap-put-thing-at-point-props' improves the
;;  behavior of (thing-at-point 'list) - see below.
;;
;;  A further step, which I recommend, is to use the `tap-' versions
;;  of standard functions, defined here, everywhere in place of those
;;  standard functions.  In other words, redefine the standard
;;  functions as the `tap-' versions defined here.  For example,
;;  redefine `bounds-of-thing-at-point' to do what
;;  `tap-bounds-of-thing-at-point' does.
;;
;;  (If you do that then you need not invoke
;;  `tap-put-thing-at-point-props' to pick up the versions defined
;;  here of standard functions.  The property values set by vanilla
;;  library `thingatpt.el' will be OK because the functions themselves
;;  will have been redefined in that case.)
;;
;;  To get the most out of this library, I recommend that you put
;;  (only) the following in your init file:
;;
;;    (eval-after-load 'thingatpt
;;      '(when (require 'thingatpt+)
;;         (tap-redefine-std-fns))
;;
;;  That makes all Emacs code that uses the following standard
;;  functions use the their versions that are defined here, not the
;;  vanilla versions defined in `thingatpt.el'.
;;
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' - Better behavior.
;;                               Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `form-at-point'            - Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `list-at-point'            - Better behavior.
;;  `symbol-at-point'          - Use `emacs-lisp-mode-syntax-table'.
;;  `thing-at-point'           - Ensure it returns a string or nil.
;;                               Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `thing-at-point-bounds-of-list-at-point'
;;                             - Better behavior.  Accept optional
;;                               args UP and UNQUOTEDP.
;;
;;
;;  Lisp Programmers
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  If you write code that uses some of the functions defined here,
;;  this section is for you.
;;
;;  You can use the functions defined in `thingatpt+.el' that have
;;  prefix `tap-' to obtain, for your code, the improvements they
;;  provide.  Doing only that has no effect on any code that calls
;;  vanilla thing-at-point functions (which have no prefix `tap-').
;;
;;  For convenience you can invoke `tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix' to
;;  provide alias functions that have the same names but without the
;;  prefix `tap-'.  This affects only functions defined here that have
;;  no vanilla counterpart, so the aliases do not collide with any
;;  standard Emacs functions.  This is just a naming convenience.
;;
;;  For example, you might do this:
;;
;;    (when (require 'thingatpt+ nil t)  ; (no error if not found)
;;      (tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix))
;;
;;  You can optionally enable the improvements defined here to have
;;  wider application, so that code that does not directly invoke the
;;  functions defined here nevertheless uses them indirectly.
;;
;;  You can, for example, put `tap-' functions on THING-type symbols
;;  as property `thing-at-point' or property
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.  That has the effect of using those
;;  `tap-' functions for those THING types only.
;;
;;  For example, to get the improvements for lists offered by
;;  `tap-list-at-point', you can do this:
;;
;;    (put 'list 'bounds-of-thing-at-point
;;         'tap-bounds-of-list-at-point)
;;    (put 'list 'thing-at-point 'tap-list-at-point)
;;
;;  That causes the vanilla thing-at-point functions to invoke those
;;  `tap-' functions when handling lists.  It has an effect only on
;;  lists, not on other THINGs.  This behavior happens because the
;;  generic vanilla functions `thing-at-point' and
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' use those standard symbol properties.
;;
;;  For even wider application, that is, if you want all of the
;;  improvements defined here to be available generally, then you will
;;  also need to do ONE of the following (#1 or #2):
;;
;;  1. Call `tap-redefine-std-fns', to redefine standard functions.
;;
;;  2. Do BOTH of these things:
;;
;;    a. Call `tap-put-thing-at-point-props', to substitute `tap-'
;;       functions for standard functions as the values of symbol
;;       properties `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
;;
;;    b. Call the individual `tap-*' functions explicitly for each of
;;       the standard functions that would be redefined by
;;       `tap-redefine-std-fns'.  Or call standard functions that make
;;       use of property `thing-at-point' or
;;       `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
;;
;;    This (#2) changes (improves) the behavior of things like
;;    (thing-at-point 'list), even though it does not redefine any
;;    standard functions.  Again, this is because functions
;;    `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point' use symbol
;;    properties `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point', and
;;    `tap-put-thing-at-point-props' changes those property values.
