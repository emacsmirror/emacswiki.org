Dired-tar adds a command for creating and unpacking
tar files in DiredMode.  When using this package, typing `T' on a tar file in a
dired listing unpacks the tar file, decompressing it if necessary.
Typing `T' on a directory packs up that directory into a gzipped
tar file named DIRNAME.tar.gz.

The package is quite old. Does anybody knows a newer version of dired-tar?

Although old (1996) it still works well in Emacs from Bzr (now in 2011). But I think something like this should be included in GNU Emacs. -- DanielClemente

2021: Yes, it has not existed as part of emacs core, probably for many years now. From any Dired buffer, just press enter on any tar or compressed tar. The mode has many features including viewing and modifying entries in place.
