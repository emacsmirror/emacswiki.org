"Filling" is the term used by Emacs to describe breaking
lines by inserting EndOfLine characters. 
It is related to LineWrap, which describes the more
general process of displaying lines that are too long for the
screen. Filling is sometimes used to avoid having to wrap
lines.

==Official documentation==
* [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Filling.html Filling Text] in the EmacsManual.
* [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Filling.html Filling] in the EmacsLispReference. 

==Common ways to fill==
===Explicit fill commands===
The FillParagraph command fills the current paragraph. By default, this is bound to <code>M-q</code>.

See the official documentation linked above for information on `fill-paragraph' and related options and commands, including `fill-region', `fill-individual-paragraphs', and `fill-region-as-paragraph', .

===Auto-Fill mode===
AutoFillMode -- MinorMode that lets Emacs break the line you are typing as soon as the last word ends beyond the right margin.
===Refill mode===
RefillMode -- fills the paragraph after each edit

==Adaptive Fill mode==
[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Adaptive-Fill.html Adaptive Fill mode] --  "sets the fill prefix automatically from the text in each paragraph being filled rather than using a predetermined value"

* FillColumnIndicator -- a minor mode that indicates the fill column, either drawing a line or shading
* FindLongLines -- finding and working with long lines
* HighlightLongLines -- another way to highlight long lines
* MarginMode -- yet another highlight column mode
