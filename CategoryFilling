[::Filling]
is the term used by Emacs to describe breaking
lines before they get too long and run off the screen. It
describes inserting carriage return characters, i.e. changing
the text. It is related to LineWrap, which describes the more
general process of displaying lines that are too long for the
screen. Filling is sometimes used to avoid having to wrap
lines.

The usual way to fill paragraphs are:

* FillParagraph -- command for filling the current paragraph.
  By default, this is bound to <code>M-q</code>.
* AutoFillMode -- MinorMode that lets Emacs break the line
  you are typing as soon as the last word ends beyond the right margin.
* TruncateLines -- the display engine will do LineWrap without taking word
  boundaries into account.  Alternatively the display engine can “truncate”
  lines.

There are a few more minor modes that may be useful:

* RefillMode -- fills the paragraph after each edit (included in GNU Emacs 21).
* WordWrapping -- looks quite similar to RefillMode.

Usually, Emacs does not make a difference between "hard" and "soft" carriage
returns. The end of each line is delineated with a newline character (\n) on
Unix. (Old versions of Mac OS use a carriage return (\r), and DOS and Windows use both (\r\n, not \n\r). This EndOfLine
convention can be adjusted in Emacs.) Because the newlines are part of the
text, the lines may look odd (too long or too short) if you later view the
file using another editor.

Conversely, you may encounter text files that do not contain newline
characters, which means that Emacs treats each line as a super long line,
making everything very hard to read. The solution for this is:

* LongLines -- inserts "soft" newlines to break long lines into shorter ones.
These "soft" newlines will not be saved to file, copied into the KillRing, etc.

Highlighting or finding long lines without necessarily filling them:

* ColumnMarker -- highlight a column (vertical line) of text, useful for Fortran or Cobol programming
* EightyColumnRule -- why some people like an 80-column cut-off
* FillColumnIndicator -- a minor mode that indicates the fill column, either drawing a line or shading
* FindLongLines -- finding and working with long lines
* HighlightLongLines -- another way to highlight long lines
* MarginMode -- yet another highlight column mode


: (Any recommendations? Too much choice!)

Unwrapping:

* UnfillParagraph, UnwrapLine -- take a paragraph and turn it into one long line
