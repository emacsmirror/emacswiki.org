"Filling" is the term used by Emacs to describe breaking
lines by inserting carriage return characters, i.e. changing
the text. It is related to LineWrap, which describes the more
general process of displaying lines that are too long for the
screen. Filling is sometimes used to avoid having to wrap
lines.

==Flavors of filling==
The usual ways to fill paragraphs are:
* FillParagraph -- command for filling the current paragraph.
  By default, this is bound to <code>M-q</code>.
* AutoFillMode -- MinorMode that lets Emacs break the line
  you are typing as soon as the last word ends beyond the right margin.

==Other useful minor modes==
There are a few more minor modes that may be useful:

* [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Adaptive-Fill.html Adaptive Fill mode] -- 
  "sets the fill prefix automatically from the text in each paragraph being 
  filled rather than using a predetermined value"
* RefillMode -- fills the paragraph after each edit (included in GNU Emacs 21).
* WordWrapping -- looks quite similar to RefillMode.

Usually, Emacs does not make a difference between "hard" and "soft" carriage
returns. The end of each line is delineated with a newline character (\n) on
Unix. (Old versions of Mac OS use a carriage return (\r), and DOS and Windows use both (\r\n, not \n\r). This EndOfLine
convention can be adjusted in Emacs.) Because the newlines are part of the
text, the lines may look odd (too long or too short) if you later view the
file using another editor.

Highlighting or finding long lines without necessarily filling them:

* ColumnMarker -- highlight a column (vertical line) of text, useful for Fortran or Cobol programming
* EightyColumnRule -- why some people like an 80-column cut-off
* FillColumnIndicator -- a minor mode that indicates the fill column, either drawing a line or shading
* FindLongLines -- finding and working with long lines
* HighlightLongLines -- another way to highlight long lines
* MarginMode -- yet another highlight column mode
