Hi all! 
We are cheerful dolphins, we live in Bali and have no problems) 
Our lifestyle is a bit of work and play, we love surfing the waves and just chilling. 
We found our best friends are Capybaras, they stand perfectly on boards and surf on the surface of the ocean, We have a great time with them) 
If you want to take a break from the drab everyday life, come to Us, Dolphins and Capybara surfers are waiting in Bali!
