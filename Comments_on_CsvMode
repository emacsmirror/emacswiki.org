One customization that comes to mind is automatically invoke csv-mode whenever loading files whose file extensions are ".psv" and ".tsv", as well as the default file extension ".csv". Further, if the file extension is ".psv", change the field-separator to the pipe; if the file extension is ".tsv", change the field separator to TAB.

Finally, and this might be a bit trickier, if the file extension is ".txt", the default text mode should be chosen when the file is first loaded into Emacs. But if the buffer already contains a file whose extension is ".txt" and the editing mode is switched to "csv-mode", then automatically change the field separator to TAB. (The reason for this is that the "Save As" feature of Microsoft Excel chooses the file extension ".txt" as a default for TAB-separated values.) Sure, we could rename the file from ".txt" to ".tsv", but on the principle of laziness as a programming virtue, let's just accommodate the behavior and figure out that if we've just switched to csv-mode on a file whose extension is ".txt", we're _most likely_ editing a TAB-separated file. HTH.

Currently cl is deprecated. Shouldn't be used cl-lib instead?

The rewrite is done. Since <code>cl-loop</code> is now an autoloaded macro from <code>cl-macs.el</code>, no require is needed.
