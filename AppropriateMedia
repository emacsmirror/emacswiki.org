See MeatBall:AppropriateMedia for some discussion.  As far as this
wiki goes, I think the following holds true:

* Documentation which is not part of the EmacsManual should
go to the wiki.
* Bugs in the Emacs/XEmacs manuals should be reported to the
maintainers.
* Examples, typical usage, customizations, and code snipplets should
go to the wiki.
* Bug reports and bug fixes to packages should be reported to the
appropriate maintainers.
* Discussions, questions, etc. usually go to the EmacsNewsgroups.  I'd
like to see more know-how collected on the wiki, but at the moment I
think that a lot of the good content comes from USENET postings which
get copied and summarized on the wiki.
* Often new content will prompt us to share more of our know-how, or
prompt us to ask questions about the stuff posted on the wiki.  This
should stay on the wiki.

I hope that doesn't discourage people from adding new content.  Remember that the most important rule of creating a good wiki is to be bold.
