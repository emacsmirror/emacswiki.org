The problem with browse-kill-ring is that when my frame is split into two windows, a and b, it will open in b if my focus is on a. When I close it (by pressing 'q') b is closed and what I had there is buried (I can select that it won't close the window it creates, but that's also not good; I might have just one window initially and I don't want to end up with two). The ideal behaviour would be similar to bs-mode (open in it's own small window and close when I press 'q' or once I select an entry).

User [[xw963]] edited the page to add this:

    This package not work on emacs 29 build with --with-pgtk.
    emacs could not assert ownership over selection: SECONDARY

No explanation or recipe.  I can't test with that option, but you need to provide much more info wrt what "not work" means.
