Emacs has a bug tracker using Debian's bug tracking software.

* http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=emacs

There is information on reporting and querying bugs from the main page.

* http://debbugs.gnu.org/

Here are some useful preset queries of the bug database.

* [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=emacs;include=severity:critical;include=severity:grave;include=severity:serious;include=severity:important Bugs that are marked critical, grave, serious or important.]

* [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=emacs;exclude=severity:wishlist;exclude=pending:done;exclude=tags:wontfix Non-wishlist bugs the developers have confirmed]

* [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?users=emacs;tag=documentation Docmentation bugs]

* [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=emacs;include=severity:wishlist;exclude=pending:done;exclude=tags:wontfix Wishlist items under consideration]

* [http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?package=emacs;include=tags:patch;exclude=tags:wontfix Submitted patches]

Given a bug number (e.g., 12345), a particular bug can be accessed as https://debbugs.gnu.org/12345.  Alternatively, the [https://guix.info/ Guix] project maintains a more "modern" looking web frontend: https://issues.guix.info/issue/12345.

Discussions about bug counts on the [[emacs-devel]] mailing list (stats compiled by Glenn Morris):

== Using the Bug Tracker ==

The current bug tracking system for Emacs is controlled by e-mail.  The [http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/debbugs.html debbugs.el] GNU ELPA package has some commands to help with this.  A brief overview of the email interface follows:

===Reporting bugs===
To send a bug report about Emacs, open Emacs and hit `M-x report-emacs-bug'.  Fill in the gaps and send the e-mail.  You may also copy the contents of the mail buffer and use your mail client of choice, it doesn't really matter where you send it from.

===Replying to an existing bug===
If you want to respond to an existing bug report, such as to provide further information or to convey that you are also running into the issue in your own configuration, you can do so by sending an email to BUG_NUMBER@debbugs.gnu.org.

If you initiate this through the index at https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnu-emacs/ with the button "reply via email to" at the bottom of the page, be sure to also add the above email address, BUG_NUMBER@debbugs.gnu.org, otherwise the email will only go specifically to the person you're replying to.

===Sending patches and other things===
To send a patch to Emacs, send an e-mail to the bug tracking system at bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org (this is the same as what `M-x report-emacs-bug' does).  The leading part of the e-mail should contain a few magic words which the system will recognize and tag the generated report with.

====Example====
The following is an example of a patch sent to the bug tracking system regarding [[rcirc]].

<pre>
Severity: wishlist
Tags: patch

My irc proxy (irssi-proxy) wants a password before allowing connections,
so I added support for this to rcirc.  The patch is attached.

[attached file]
</pre>

The system will recognize that the severity of this report should be "wishlist", which basically means "feature request".  The report is also tagged with "patch".  This will let it show in the submitted patches list, linked above.

===Updating reports===
To update a report, send an e-mail to control@debbugs.gnu.org.  The leading part of the e-mail, similar to when adding reports, should contain keywords that tell the system how to update the report.

* <code>severity 3923 minor</code> sets the severity of bug report #3923 to "minor". The possible severities are ##critical##, ##grave##, ##serious##, ##important##, ##normal##, ##minor##, and ##wishlist##.
* <code>tags 3923 + patch unreproducible</code> adds the ##patch## and ##unreproducible## tags to bug report 3923. Use a hyphen (##-##) instead of a plus to remove tags. Use an equals sign (##=##) to set exactly what tags the report should have.
*  Mark bug#3923 as a "documentation" bug, so that is shows up in the documentation bug list mentioned above:
<pre>user emacs
usertag 3923 documentation
</pre>
