== MyrkraVerk's page ==

Hello, my name is J&oacute;hann Gunnar &Oacute;skarsson and I call
myself [::myrkraverk] on the EmacsChannel and other places.  I am the author of several
pages on this wiki, though some of them have been rewritten since by
more capable authors ;-)

My blog: http://www.myrkraverk.com/blog/

I do not want to sign my work, so that other people won't have any
scrouples for changing them, but I like to have a list of them here.
I do not want a link from them to this page.

These pages are (this may not be a complete list):
* CurlEmodule -- XEmacs bindings for libcurl
* TinyFugueMode
* InternationalConsoleFonts -- using international fonts in the terminal
* QtMode -- using emacs to write Qt applications and halde the Qt
specific keywords
* CcMode -- The original "indentation style by source location" trick
* MuPAD -- is a computer algebra system
* MuPACS -- is an emacs interface to MuPAD
* SettingMetaWithXKB -- using the XKB extension to make the meta key work
* NumberedWindows -- using numbers to swich windows
* ConsoleKeys -- using the same keys in console as X, and making them available
* FormattingText -- some tricks to automagically format text
* SubdirsToList -- a nifty trick to add lotsa subdirs to list, notably load-path
* BbdbImporters -- importing stuff into BBDB

I also added a nifty trick to switch W3M tabs to WThreeMTabs.  But now I don't remember what it was.
