== MyrkraVerk's page ==

Hello, my name is J&oacute;hann Gunnar &Oacute;skarsson and I call
myself [::myrkraverk] on the EmacsChannel and other places.  I am the author of several
pages on this wiki, though some of them have been rewritten since by
more capable authors ;-)

I am no longer one of the core developers of [http://www.sxemacs.org/ SXEmacs], a fork of [http://www.xemacs.org/ XEmacs] that was made public during the last hours of 2004.  Where I'm going to fit myself into the Emacs world remains to be seen (at the time of this writing).

I do not want to sign my work, so that other people won't have any
scrouples for changing them, but I like to have a list of them here.
I do not want a link from them to this page.

These pages are (this may not be a complete list):
* TinyFugueMode
* InternationalConsoleFonts -- using international fonts in the terminal
* QtMode -- using emacs to write Qt applications and halde the Qt
specific keywords
* CcMode -- The original "indentation style by source location" trick
* MuPAD -- is a computer algebra system
* MuPACS -- is an emacs interface to MuPAD
* SettingMetaWithXKB -- using the XKB extension to make the meta key work
* NumberedWindows -- using numbers to swich windows
* ConsoleKeys -- using the same keys in console as X, and making them available
* FormattingText -- some tricks to automagically format text
* SubdirsToList -- a nifty trick to add lotsa subdirs to list, notably load-path
* BbdbImporters -- importing stuff into BBDB

I also added a nifty trick to switch W3M tabs to WThreeMTabs.

There are web pages of mine at http://www.myrkraverk.com/
and http://www.myrkraverk.net/ though nothing very important on them.

I'm also the maintainer of masp,
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/masp/

And I also maintain a port of Colossal Cave or Adventure, sometimes
called advent at http://playstation2-linux.com/projects/advent

* MyrkraVerkDiscussion -- a discussion that took place between
AlexSchroeder and PierreGaston when I was new here and I didn't find
out until much later ;-)
