;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to standard library `simple.el'.
;;
;;  See also library `icicles.el' for extensions to `simple.el' that
;;  concern input completion in the minibuffer.  Those extensions used
;;  to be in this library, but they are used by `icicles.el', so they
;;  have been moved there.
;;
;;  Things you might want to do:
;;
;;  * Turn on `hl-line-mode' in compilation and grep buffers:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'next-error-hook 'next-error-buffer-hl-line)
;;
;;  * Change the fringe indicator for `next-error':
;;
;;    (add-hook 'next-error-hook 'next-error-fringe-setup)
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `set-any-variable'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `next-error-buffer-hl-line', `next-error-fringe-setup',
;;    `read-var-and-value'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `next-error-fringe-indicator', `set-any-variable-value-history'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following user options defined in `simple.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `next-error-highlight', `next-error-highlight-no-select'
;;                            - New value: `until-move' (persistent).
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `simple.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `edit-and-eval-command' - Bug fix for < Emacs 21: Adds COMMAND
;;                              as a command to `command-history', not
;;                              as a string.
;;
;;    `kill-new'              - Bug fix for < Emacs 21: be sure
;;                              `kill-ring' is non-empty before trying
;;                              to replace kill.
;;
;;    `next-error'            - `C-u C-u' just deletes highlighting
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: This EMACS PRIMITIVE has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `set-variable' - Uses `read-var-and-value' to get args.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2015/06/16 dadams
;;     Added: next-error-buffer-hl-line, next-error-fringe-setup,
;;            next-error-fringe-indicator.
;; 2015/06/13 dadams
;;     next-error: next-error-recenter is not defined for Emacs 22, so use boundp.
;; 2012/02/03 dadams
;;     read-var-and-value:
;;       Added optional arg BUFFER.  Use default-value if var is not local.
;;     set(-any)-variable:
;;       Add BUFFER arg in call to read-var-and-value (only for Icicles).
;;       Set default value, if not MAKE-LOCAL.
;; 2011/05/16 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of kill-new for Emacs 20.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookie for command set-any-variable.
;; 2009-02-22 dadams
;;     Added: next-error(-highlight(-no-select)).
;; 2006/09/15 dadams
;;     set-variable: Protect custom-variable-p if not defined.
;; 2006/08/03 dadams
;;     No longer initialize kill-ring to ("") - no longer needed, and can cause problems.
;; 2005-10-31 dadams
;;     Added: set-any-variable-value-history, read-var-and-value, set*-variable.
;; 2005/10/03 dadams
;;     Removed require of icomplete+.el (no longer redefines read-from-minibuffer).
;; 2005/07/28 dadams
;;     Moved all completion stuff to icicles.el:
;;       choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function, switch-to-completions.
;;     No longer require icicles.el.
;;     Removed: completion-reference-buffer.
;;     completion-setup-function:
;;       Renamed icicle-completing-read-prompt-suffix to icicle-prompt-suffix.
;; 2005/07/15 dadams
;;     choose-completion-string, completion-setup-function: Updated for Emacs 21+.
;; 2005/07/10 dadams
;;     Renamed: command-calling-for-completion -> icicle-cmd-calling-for-completion.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Only redefine edit-and-eval-command & choose-completion-string if prior to Emacs 21.
;; 1999/03/17 dadams
;;     1. choose-completion-string: Added doc string.  Updated to correspond to
;;        Emacs 34.1 version.
;;     2. completion-setup-function: diff prompt setups.  face1 & face2 tests.
;;     3. Added: switch-to-completions.
;; 1996/06/14 dadams
;;     kill-ring: Bug fix: `mouse-save-then-kill' expects a consp, so ensure this.
;; 1996/04/26 dadams
;;     Put escaped newlines on long-line strings.

    "Visit next `next-error' message and corresponding source code.
If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.

A numeric prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
 negative means move back to previous error messages.
Plain `\\[universal-argument]' means reparse the error message buffer and start at the
first error.
`C-u C-u' means just delete the highlight overlay (if any).

The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.

`\\[next-error]' normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the \\[compile], \\[grep] commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
`\\[next-error]' in that buffer when it is the only one displayed
in the current frame.

Once `\\[next-error]' has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.

See variables `compilation-parse-errors-function' (prior to Emacs 29)
and `compilation-error-regexp-alist' for customization ideas."
