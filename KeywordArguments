: I do not like the Common Lisp style of using keyword arguments
for many common functions.  I basically do not have a very high
opinion of many of the decisions that were made in Common Lisp.

Keyword arguments are used in CommonLisp. What's their purpose (advantage)? They let you provide certain optional arguments in ''any order''. If function `my-func' is defined with keyword parameters ##:foo##, ##:bar##, and ##:titi##, then you can, for example, write any of the following:

 (my-func :foo foo-val :titi titi-val)
 (my-func :titi titi-val :foo foo-val :bar bar-val)
 (my-func :bar bar-val :foo foo-val)

Being able to write keyword arguments in any order is especially advantageous (for reading code) when there are many keyword parameters.

In EmacsLisp, here's part of the description of function `make-hash-table', which uses the common keyword parameter ##:test##:

: ##:test TEST## -- ##TEST## must be a symbol that specifies how to compare
keys.  Default is `eql'.  Predefined are the tests `eq', `eql', and
`equal'.  [...]

You might use this as follows:

: ##(let ((map (make-hash-table :test '##'''##equal##'''##))) ...)##

In this case, the comparison function `equal' will override the default comparison function, `eql'.

'''Note:''' `make-hash-table' is an ''exception'' in two regards:

* In EmacsLisp (outside of its common-lisp compatibility libraries), `make-hash-table' seems to be the only place (so far) where ##:test## is recognized. You can, of course, write your own Emacs-Lisp code that recognizes ##:test##.

* In CommonLisp, you can supply any comparison function for ##:test## -- it need not be one of those that are mentioned above as predefined for `make-hash-table': `eq', `eql', and `equal'. This is also true for Emacs-Lisp's  `make-hash-table', but in that case you will need to use `define-hash-table-test' to define your own key-comparison function for hash tables. In the usual case, you can just use `defun' to define a comparison function.


You can also use the cl-parsing-keywords (cl--parsing-keywords in newer Emacsen) as defined in the common lisp compatibility library in Emacs:


 (defun foobar (&rest cl-keys)
   "`foobar' takes keyword arguments of :foo and :bar like this:
  (foobar :foo 23)
  (foobar :bar 42)"
   (cl-parsing-keywords ((:foo nil) (:bar nil)) nil
     (format "cl-foo is %S and cl-bar is %S" cl-foo cl-bar)))
