You can use OrgMode to blog.  There are a few different ways to do this:

* [http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html org-publish] -- built in to org
* [https://github.com/Malabarba/ox-jekyll-subtree ox-jekyll-subtree] -- publish entries in an org file to Jekyll
* [http://orgmode.org/worg/blorgit.html blorgit] -- publish org files with Ruby Sinatra
* [https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg lazyblorg] -- publish from org files to static blog
* [https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog/ org2blog] -- publish org files to !WordPress
* [https://ox-hugo.scripter.co ox-hugo] -- export Org subtrees/files to Markdown with front-matter for [https://gohugo.io Hugo] static site generator
* Also see OrgJournal and [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-journal.el scimax-journal.el]] for text based [CategoryJournaling journaling]. This can be combined with the above packages to publish a specific subtree or entire Org file
* [https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/one/ One.el] -- EmacsConf talk : static site publishing using Emacs with org source files


No longer maintained:
