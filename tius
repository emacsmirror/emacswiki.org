From 2006 to June 2011 I've been using <b>gNewSense</b>, from June 2011 using <b>Trisquel</b>, and I'm very satisfied.

I use <b>Emacs</b>

== Website ==
[http://www.tius.it Tius.it]


== Blog ==
I have not a blog. I'm a reader, not writer ;-)



How I use <b>Emacs</b>:

== Text Editor ==

== Shell ==

== Internet relay chat client, with ERC ==
Although very rarely

== Music Player with EMMS ==


I'm trying to use it also as e-mail client
