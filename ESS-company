ESS integrates out of the box with `company-mode'.

Two company backends are available `company-R-objects' and `company-R-args'.

== Initialization ==

From ESS company-mode is activated by default if you have company package installed. Change the value of `ess-use-company' if you don't want that.

This activates company backends in both ESS and iESS buffers. If you want them only in your ESS buffers do:

{{{
(setq ess-use-company 'script-only)
}}}

== Quick help ==

Make `M-h' to display quick help:

{{{
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-h") 'company-show-doc-buffer)
}}}

== Movement keys ==

`company' binds M-n, and M-p for navigation. This is rather inconvenient if you use `company' in the inferior R buffer. Bind those to something else:

{{{
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-n") nil)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-p") nil)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-,") 'company-select-next)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-k") 'company-select-previous)
}}}

== Completion keys ==

Company binds `RET' key to `company-complete-selection'. This is rather inconvenient in inferior R buffers. One solution is to use `TAB' to complete common part and `M-TAB' for full selection:

{{{
(define-key company-active-map [return] nil)
(define-key company-active-map [tab] 'company-complete-common)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "TAB") 'company-complete-common)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'company-complete-selection)
}}}


== Misc customization ==

Some company settings that I found useful:

{{{
(setq company-selection-wrap-around t
      company-tooltip-align-annotations t
      company-idle-delay 0.36
      company-minimum-prefix-length 2
      company-tooltip-limit 10)
}}}
