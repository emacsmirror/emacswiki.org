A XML markup made by LdBeth, project homepage is at [https://ldbeth.sdf.org/lsml/] which sources and examples, which is also used for the XML namespace. Similar to org-mime.el but uses XML instead of OrgMode.

Currently it only supports sending email with WanderLust.

== How to install ==

It might not be obvious, but consult NxmlMode on details about how to install new RelaxNG schemas.

Add these lines to schemas.xml, and move lsml.rnc to somewhere emacs know about.

{{{
  <namespace ns="https://ldbeth.sdf.org/lsml" typeId="LsML"/>
  <documentElement prefix="" localName="lsml" typeId="LsML"/>
  <typeId id="LsML" uri="lsml.rnc"/>
}}}

Load lsml.el, and modify lsml-xsl-directory to where lsml.xsl and lsml-mime.xsl are placed.

Once done composing email, run M-x `lsml-compose' RET.
