=Update on EUDC LDAP configuration=

EUDC LDAP configuration is simpler in Emacs 25.  There shouldn't be a need to call <tt>eudc-set-server</tt> anymore.  All configuration should be declarative like other packages.

Many of the below setq's are for bad defaults and outright bugs in EUDC.  I tried to fix those for Emacs 25.  I also updated the EUDC manual with an "LDAP Configuration" section.  If you go through that section, rewrite your configuration, and something doesn't work, please file a bug at bug-gnu-emacs.

=Get email adress expansion with EUDC and LDAP=

Adapt and add the following to your .emacs file:

<pre>
(require 'ldap)
(require 'eudc)

(setq eudc-default-return-attributes nil
      eudc-strict-return-matches nil)

(setq ldap-ldapsearch-args (quote ("-tt" "-LLL" "-x")))
(setq eudc-inline-query-format '((name)
                                 (firstname)
                                 (firstname name)
                                 (email)
                                 ))

(setq ldap-host-parameters-alist
      (quote (("your_server" base "ou=addressbook,dc=your_dc_here,dc=fr"
               binddn "cn=admin,dc=your_dc_here,dc=fr"
               passwd "your_password"))))

(eudc-set-server "your_server" 'ldap t)
(setq eudc-server-hotlist '(("your_server" . ldap)))
(setq eudc-inline-expansion-servers 'hotlist)

(defun enz-eudc-expand-inline()
  (interactive)
  (move-end-of-line 1)
  (insert "*")
  (unless (condition-case nil
              (eudc-expand-inline)
            (error nil))
    (backward-delete-char-untabify 1))
  )

;; Adds some hooks

(eval-after-load "message"
  '(define-key message-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'enz-eudc-expand-inline))
(eval-after-load "sendmail"
  '(define-key mail-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'enz-eudc-expand-inline))
(eval-after-load "post"
  '(define-key post-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'enz-eudc-expand-inline))
</pre>

eudc-inline-query doesn't seem to work for me.  With multiple results I always get the message "Multiple matches found; choose one: " and possible completions are "  <>" (an empty result string).  Any ideas?  I don't see any error messages.  Queries with single results work fine.

   This may work now in Emacs 25 (i.e., master branch as of 2015-05-16).  If you can, retry and file a bug if it doesn't work.  Re-read the EUDC manual's "LDAP Configuration" section, which has seen a bunch of updates, including an ldapsearch troubleshooting subsection.

Is there a way to perform multiple queries on the *same* server? --Mitch

   Not yet.  If you still want this feature, please file a bug so that we can discuss how this should work.
