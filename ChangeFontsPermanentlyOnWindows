= Emacs 23 =

Use the menu:

* Options > Set Default Font ...
* Options > Save Options

This saves the font to .emacs.

Optionally, you can add some code to init.el directly:

##(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Andale Mono-12")##

or this, which works quite well for Emacs on Windows:

##(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Consolas" :height 110)##

= For older Emacs-versions = 

== Automatic ==
Lisp:frame-restore.el will save/restore the font you've selected through the mouse-set-font menu.  this means you never have to know the "X format" name.  very handy if you change the font often.


== Manual ==
The problem is that you need to use the X format of specifying a font.
Here's how to do it (works with recent versions of Gnu-Emacs (Oct.2007)):

* Switch to the *scratch* buffer (Menu: Buffers--%%*scratch*%%)
* type ##(w32-select-font)## followed by C-j (or M-x ##eval-print-last-sexp##)
* select the desired font from the menu dialog that ensues
* copy the string that is displayed (something like: 
  ##"-outline-Lucida Sans Typewriter-normal-r-normal-normal-12-90-96-96-c-*-iso8859-1"##)
  and paste it into the .emacs file (MsWindowsDotEmacs) or the registry (MsWindowsRegistry).
  If .emacs is used the line to add is:
  ##(set-face-font 'default "##/fontname/##")##
  where /fontname/ is the copied string


==For even older Emacs-versions==

(these are earlier guidelines on this page)

# Set the font to what you like with s-down-mouse-1
# Figure out what that font is called
## switch to the *scratch* buffer 
## enter "(frame-parameters)" without the quotes
## place the cursor after the closing paren and hit C-j
## a list of frame parameters will appear in the buffer.  Look for something in the list like: (font . "-outline-Courier New-normal-r-normal-normal-16-120-96-96-c-100-iso8859-1")
# copy the font form from the *scratch* buffer, and then add this to your .emacs  (notice the added ' before the font form you just copied):
<tt>
 (add-to-list
    'default-frame-alist
    '(font . "-outline-Courier New-normal-r-normal-normal-16-120-96-96-c-100-iso8859-1"))
</tt>

The next time you start emacs, you'll have the font you want.

Even simpler is just to evaluate (press <code>C-x C-e</code> at the end of the line):
<pre>
(insert (prin1-to-string (w32-select-font)))
</pre>

It will show you a dialog, from which you can choose font, and insert its name at the current point.

With Emacs >= 21.x you can do it like:  <tt>(set-face-font 'default "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso8859-15")</tt>
  in your .emacs

Sorry, but this does not work for me using GNU Emacs 21.2 on Windows XP. I can only
see this: 

((display . "") (visibility . t) (icon-name) (window-id . "917794")
(top . 0) (left . 0) (buffer-list #<buffer *scratch*> #<buffer NEWS>
# <buffer *Minibuf-1*> #<buffer *Customize Faces*>) (unsplittable)
(minibuffer . #<window 4 on *Minibuf-0*>) (modeline . t) (width . 80)
(height . 40) ...)

but not any kind of font information. Any hints?

: Evaluating <tt>(frame-parameters)</tt> on recent versions gets you a truncated result (hence the three dots at the end), so it's no longer a useful way of finding out the current font name. --MichaelMason

: I'm sure there's a prettier way to do this in elisp but you can find the font information by pasting this in the scratch buffer, putting the TextCursor at the end, and hitting C-j: (let (r) (mapcar (lambda (e) (if (eq (car e) 'font) (push e r))) (frame-parameters)) r) -- JDC

: Simplest way that i always do is just do M-x set-face-font RET default RET .. now you get the list of the fonts that can be recognized by emacs.. something like -outline-XXX.. Select the one you want, C-k C-g and then paste it in for the default-frame-alist.. --GirishB

: Another way is to type "(frame-parameter nil 'font)" without the quotes to the *scratch* buffer and hit C-j.

: You can display the full set of parameters for the current frame by evaluating <tt>(prin1-to-string (frame-parameters))</tt>. -- MichaelMason
: A pretty printing version of the above: <tt>(pr-to-string (frame-parameters))</tt>. -- Yamitai

: You can display a list of the available fonts by evaluating <tt>(prin1-to-string (x-list-fonts "*"))</tt>. -- MichaelMason

Note: when you use the "change buffer font" menu, the font selected doesn't affect the frame. Examine the buffer-face-mode-remapping variable for that using C-h v buffer-face-mode-remapping. -- Yamitai

[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-30 03:48 UTC]
You can see the available fonts, and the effect each has, by cycling through them with command `##doremi-font+##' in library <tt>[[doremi-frm.el]]</tt>. -- DrewAdams

[new]
If you would like emacs to start with a specific font, instead of jumping around as it resizes, you can put your font configuration in the MsWindowsRegistry (and frame size):
<pre>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs]
"Emacs.FONT"="-*-Lucida Console-normal-r-*-*-11-82-96-96-c-*-iso8859-1"
"Emacs.GEOMETRY"="90x60"
</pre>
-- Dmb

[new]
But how about fontset? Is there any way to define fontset even before emacs starts?
