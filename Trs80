=== My Emacs Story ===

It took me maybe 3 tries (over period of years) to finally 'get off the ground' with Emacs.  I created this profile 2020-08-27 (to contribute my first edit), but by then I had been lurking here for a year or two (more?) already.

By now (2023-02-11) I have become quite comfortable in Emacs, and with EmacsLisp.  I participate on the mailing lists and in [[IRC]] (as time allows).  I have even released a couple packages (and have several more 'in the works')!

As time goes on, I find myself bringing more and more of my computing into Emacs -- apparently, all the memes are true (lol)!  The most recent were email (Gnus) and IRC (ERC).  It's very comforting having a consistent, cozy environment for a change (I find almost all 'modern' user interfaces pretty schizophrenic in this regard).

=== My Emacs Packages ===

I really enjoy using Sourcehut as a public forge.  Here are some links:

* [https://sr.ht/projects/~trs-80/?search=%23emacs Emacs-related packages]
* [https://sr.ht/~trs-80/ Main profile page] - Includes some other projects, recent activity, link to public inbox, etc.

=== Public chat ===

I guess you can leave a note below, but I only log in here sporadically.
