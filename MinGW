Minimalist GNU For Windows

* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ minGW] : "A native Windows port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), with freely distributable import libraries and header files for building native Windows applications; includes extensions to the MSVC runtime to support C99 functionality. All of MinGW's software will execute on the 64bit Windows platforms."  (last update: 2021)

* [https://www.mingw-w64.org/ minGW-64] : "Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project.... It was forked in 2007 in order to provide 64-bit support and newer APIs. It has since then gained wide use and distribution." (last update: 2025)



Note that MinGW is a separate project from CygWin, but it's easy to confuse the two because their aims are somewhat similar, and because CygWin itself includes some of MinGW (headers and libraries, I think).  Also note that building Emacs with MinGW works fine, but building Emacs with Cygwin is troublesome.  See BuildingOnWindowsTableofContents for the gory details.
