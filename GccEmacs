!GccEmacs refers to the ##--with-native-compilation## configuration option when building Emacs, which adds support for compiling EmacsLisp to native code using ##libgccjit##. All of the Elisp packages shipped with Emacs are native-compiled, providing a noticeable performance improvement out-of-the-box. Third-party packages are also compiled to achieve further performance improvements.

The official development log can be found on [http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html the gccemacs page].

The feature is discussed in detail in the paper [https://zenodo.org/record/3736363 "Bringing GNU Emacs to native code"] and related [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKHYZOAc_bQ talk].

== Installation ==

=== From source ===

To build !GccEmacs, you will need ##libgccjit## in addition to the other dependencies described in BuildingEmacs.

First, checkout the latest stable release branch (from ##emacs-28## onwards) or the unstable ##master## branch, and configure it with the ##--with-native-compilation## flag:

    $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
    $ git checkout emacs-28
    $ cd emacs
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --with-native-compilation
    $ make -j$(nproc)

You should see //"Does Emacs have native lisp compiler? yes"// near the end of the configure output if native compilation has been enabled.

If you wish, install conventionally with ##make install## otherwise run it from the build tree with ##./src/emacs##.

==== Spack ====
If you're using unixy system with non-root access and would like to install emacs from source without being bothered by installing dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    $ ./spack/bin/spack install emacs@master+native+tls

if spack doesn't work, set ##SPACK_PYTHON## to python3 path. You can customize more, see https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/emacs/package.py for options.

=== fedora ===

    dnf copr enable deathwish/emacs-pgtk-nativecomp

then

    dnf update emacs

or

    dnf install emacs

=== ArchLinux ===

An ##emacs-git## package is available [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emacs-git/ on the AUR] which tracks Emacs 28 where the native compilation feature has been merged.

Install it with your favourite AUR helper, or use the following commands to do it yourself:

    $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/emacs-git.git
    $ cd emacs-git
    $ sed -i 's/^JIT=\(     \)/JIT="YES"/' PKGBUILD  # At the moment native just-in-time compilation in the package disabled by default 
    $ makepkg --syncdeps --install

=== Debian/unstable ===

The emacs-snapshot packages are now built with this support: http://emacs.secretsauce.net

==== Daemon systemd service crashing on startup ====

If ##systemctl --user start emacs.service## immediately crashes and ##journalctl --user -u emacs## mentions a long path mentioning ##native-lisp## and ending with ##.eln##, add the following line to the ##[Service]## section in ##/usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service##:

    WorkingDirectory=/usr/lib/emacs/28.0.50/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/

=== Guix ===

An ##emacs-native-comp## package is available [https://github.com/flatwhatson/guix-channel in this channel].

Add the channel to your ##~/.config/guix/channels.scm##, or use the following commands to install it as a one-off:

    $ git clone https://github.com/flatwhatson/guix-channel.git
    $ guix install --load-path=./guix-channel emacs-native-comp

=== Nix ===

An ##emacsGcc## package is available from the Nix community's [https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay Emacs overlay].

Detailed installation instructions are available [https://gist.github.com/mjlbach/179cf58e1b6f5afcb9a99d4aaf54f549 in this Gist].

=== Docker ===

An ##emacs-nativecomp## docker image is [https://hub.docker.com/r/andreacorallo/emacs-nativecomp available]. Also examine the gitlab repo for the [https://gitlab.com/koral/emacs-nativecomp-dockerfile dockerfile].

=== macOS ===

The ##Gccemacs## prebuilt packages are [https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds available] and updated daily using GitHub action.
The build script is also [https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos available].

    $ brew tap jimeh/emacs-builds
    $ brew install --cask emacs-app-nightly-28

It's also possible to install the package via [https://brew.sh/ homebrew] with [https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus this formula].

    $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
    $ brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp

=== Windows ===

The ##Gccemacs## prebuilt packages are [https://github.com/kiennq/emacs-build/releases available] and updated semi-monthly using GitHub action.
The build script is also available in the same [https://github.com/kiennq/emacs-build github repo].

It's also possible to install the package via [https://scoop.sh/ scoop] with [https://github.com/kiennq/scoop-misc/blob/master/emacs-k.json this bucket].

    $ scoop install emacs-k

== Usage ==

By default Emacs ships only native compiling the files included in the Emacs image.

The native compilation of the remaining Emacs distribution and external packages happen automatically and asynchronously (See Deferred compilation).

=== Deferred compilation ===

Deferred compilation refers to //"just-in-time"// native compilation of Elisp.  When a byte-compiled Elisp module is loaded, it gets queued for native compilation.  Once native compilation has finished, the native-compiled definitions automatically replace the byte-compiled versions.

This is simple to use as it does not require any user intervention.  You may prefer an //"ahead-of-time"// solution described further below.

Deferred compilation is **enabled by default** and controlled by the ##comp-deferred-compilation## customize.

=== Ahead-of-time compilation ===

Sometimes it is useful to compile ahead-of-time, for example if you are packaging Emacs for others.

==== Emacs distribution ====

It is possible to native compile ahead-of-time all the Emacs distribution using the ##NATIVE_FULL_AOT##, for example:

    $ make NATIVE_FULL_AOT=1 -j$(nproc)

==== External packages ====

The built-in package manager package.el supports ahead-of-time native compilation when installing a package. Customize the user option `package-native-compile' or add this to your init file to enable it:

    (setq package-native-compile t)

Some third-party package managers also support ahead-of-time native compilation:

* [https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el straight.el] native-compiles packages by default.

You can native-compile your packages manually:

    ;; native-compile all Elisp files under a directory
    (native-compile-async "/path/to/packages" 'recursively)

This will add all Emacs Lisp files under that directory to the queue for asynchronous native compilation.

If you are running native compilation from a script, you will need to block the Emacs process until the async jobs have completed:

    ;; block until native compilation has finished
    (while (or comp-files-queue
               (> (comp-async-runnings) 0))
      (sleep-for 1))

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Very slow load times ===

If you're running anti-virus software, each native-compiled library may get scanned for viruses when loaded, which can have a dramatic impact on loading performance, especially when starting Emacs for the first time in a session.

If you're experiencing such slowness, test disabling your anti-virus to see whether that's the cause.
