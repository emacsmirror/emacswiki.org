== -> Requires Space ==

If you use ##->## followed by a newline, it is not translated into an arrow: ->

A space is required after the arrow to prevent false positives: -> there you go.


== Highlight Formatting ==

[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-24 22:52 UTC]

How about an option for ''highlighting text background''? For example, an RGB code could be used: <code><#E6E6FA>...</#E6E6FA></code> would put the enclosed text on a very pale background. (No nesting of <#> tags allowed.) -- DrewAdams

[new]
AlexSchroeder: I would prefer a fixed list of highlighting colors (or just one), so that I can use an em or strong tag from HTML with an appropriate class and style it depending on the style sheet (and still make it usable for text browsers).  What do you think about that?

[new:DrewAdams:2005-11-01 21:53 UTC]
[Almost a year delay in replying -- didn't notice your reply & question.]

No reason not to have what you suggest, for use with CSS. But why a fixed list of colors? People could specify any colors (in #RGB form) in their CSS files.

And why not have both? Why not let people also put <code><#E6E6FA>...</#E6E6FA></code> tags in the source page. Not as modular and elegant as CSS, but in some ways more flexible. -- DrewAdams

[new]
A fixed list would have the benefit of an implementation using CSS classes, and therefore CSS authors could change the colors to adapt to color themes. -- Alex


[new:DrewAdams:2005-11-01 23:39 UTC]
I see.  That's good too. I was thinking only of people using arbitrary colors in CSS. E.g. -- 

 h1, h2, h3, h4 {
   font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
   color: #369;
   background-color: white;
 }

 h1 {
   font-size: 1.6em;
   font-weight: bold;
   border: solid #cc9;
   border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px;
   width: 100%;
 }

Or:

 .my-whatever {                  
   background-color:#E6E6FA;            
 }

I'm no CSS expert -- I'll leave it up to you. -- DrewAdams


== Comments ==

May we have comments?  It might be useful to make notes as to why something was done a certain way in a page.

   <!-- has no effect -->

   /* has no effect */

   // has no effect

[new]
There is no way to have something on a wiki page and not have it show up on the HTML.
Is there a real need for this?  Why not have meta text coexist with the real text?
-- AlexSchroeder

== OddMuse Wiki syntax vs. HTML ==
Why are you punishing people who know HTML by making us learn another set of tags?  This is not easier.  I would have posted good info here several times, but wading through a new syntactical system is just too much.  What's so hard about, e.g., enclosing text in <xmp>...</xmp>?  (I couldn't find instructions on how to do this in your "new and improved" syntax.) Or <h1>...</h1>?  Yeah, that's a brain-buster.

[new]
I find it harder to write correct HTML than any of the various alternatives out there.  Since there are so many alternatives out there, I am not alone in thinking that having to write HTML directly is a big problem. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Another problem with allowing people to write unrestricted HTML directly (Oddmuse + extensions used here allow for some HTML tags, like &lt;u&gt; and &lt;/u&gt; for <u>underline</u>) is security, among others cross site scripting. Also it would be easier to transform the pages into (invisible) link farms. -- JakubNarebski

== Embedding HTML ==

Something ElWiki will do already is allow embedding of HTML. This is //very// useful for screencasts and the like. Could we allow that?

ElWiki uses the creole form which is:

{{{
<<html
some html goes here
html>>
}}}

it's pretty easy to support and quite useful.

An alternative would be to just do youtube style embedding of video links I guess... but that's quite hard.

[new]
If you're one of the EmacsWikiAdministrators, you can already add raw HTML. Compare [[Search]] and Self:action=browse;raw=1;id=Search.
Currently raw HTML is only allowed on locked pages---and only administrators can edit locked pages.
The reason it was designed that way was that I hoped this would prevent people from ever adding malicious code to the wiki.

If you /really/ want it, I could add some code to allow raw HTML everywhere. Are you sure this is what we want?
-> Oddmuse:Raw_HTML

It would be just as easy to add an extension that supports embedding from a limited number of video hosting sites. Perhaps that would be preferable? -> Oddmuse:Flashbox_Extension

-- Alex

[new:NicFerrier:2013-04-07 13:27 UTC]
Yeah. I guess it is problematic. I'll have to think about that for creole. I guess we could whitelist certain HTML tags, parse the HTML and only allow what's whitelisted. 

I think it would be very difficult to support lots of different movie formats. Especially right now as that whole world is changing a lot.

The trouble is the movie plugins vary so much. Some are js, some (like youtubes) are iframes and some are just EMBEDs or HTML5 movie objects.

But I guess supporting movies directly is really the only way to go right now. It would be cool if EmacsWiki could support them coz they're obviously a great way to teach newbies. 

[new:sshaw:2015-10-03 21:42 UTC]
<code>kbd</code> tags should be allowed. I'm surprised that this is not supported. Why not add them? This wiki is full of keystrokes. -- sshaw

== Slightly richer source code ==

The automatic semicolon detection enables the "download" link and syntax highlighting, but makes it impossible to add a category or link to the author's home page.
Any way to have both worlds?
It's OK if the unformatted section must come in the middle and the formatted sections must come at either end.


== Small problems ==

The horizontal-line feature isn't documented as well as it could be -- I only found a passing mention.

I wanted a command name and an apostrophe: ##`undo''s state## but I got a command name and an open quote: `undo''s state
