[https://melpa.org/#/visual-fill-column Visual Fill Column] is a small Emacs minor mode used with VisualLineMode.  Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, it wraps at ##fill-column## or, if ##fill-column## is too large for the window, at the window edge.

Together VisualFillColumn and VisualLineMode are similar to the now-defunct LongLines mode.

For a visual representation see https://codeberg.org/joostkremers/visual-fill-column.

For a similar (soft) wrap on the *left* side see AdaptiveWrap.
