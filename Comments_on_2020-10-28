Sorry, but I don't understand. I tried putting "gemini://emacswiki.org" in my browser address bar (without the quotes), but that just searches for that text. The browser (e.g. Chrome/Brave, FireFox) doesn't recognize protocol "gemini". What am I missing? Are you using EWW?

There's a Gopher and Gemini client for Emacs called [https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/ Elpher].

No web browser I know of has implemented the Gemini protocol. There are a bunch of other clients that you could use instead. [https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html Gemini Clients] has a list.

It's no longer operating. I ended up not using it and there were too many things about it that didn't work correctly. Sorry!
