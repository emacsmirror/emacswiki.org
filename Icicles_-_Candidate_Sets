== Sets of Completion Candidates ==

Whereas `C-RET' (see [[Icicles - Multi-Commands]]) acts 
on individual objects, `##C-!##' acts on an entire set of objects at once, via their ''names'': the ''set of all current [[completion]] candidates''.  There are additional '''Icicles''' [[command]]s that also act, not on individual completion candidates, but on one or more sets of completion candidates.

One of these is '''`M-*'''' or `S-SPC', which effectively narrows the set of
completion candidates by taking the intersection of the candidate
sets defined by various input [[regexp]]s.  

This page presents some more '''Icicles''' commands that act on sets
of completion candidates.  The basic idea is that you can perform set operations using the
current set of completion candidates, changing it into a different
set.  You can, then, for example, use
`##C-!##' to act on everything in a custom-defined set.  Or you can
define a custom set that you want to use often (for example, a
[[list]] of project files), save it persistently, and then retrieve it
later to use for completion.

Another way of acting on a set of candidates is to insert them
into the minibuffer and then use '''`M-R'''' -- see [[Icicles - Multi-Inputs]].












[:SavingAndRetrieving]
== Saving and Retrieving Completion Candidates ==

Set operations such as union and difference act on two sets.  The
current set of completion candidates is always one of these sets.
If an operation, such as set complement, acts on a single set,
then it acts on the current set.

When two sets are involved, the other set is called the "''saved''
set".  This just means that at some previous time in your sesssion
you saved some completion candidates as the value of [[variable]]
'''`icicle-saved-completion-candidates''''.  

In [[buffer]] `*Completions*', candidates that have been saved are
highlighted using [[face]] `icicle-saved-candidate'.  Here is a screenshot showing this:

[[image:DrewsEmacsSavedCandidates]]

By default, the saved set is not persistent; it is saved only
until the next save in the same Emacs session overwrites it or
adds to it.  See [[Icicles - Persistent Completions]]
for ways to save candidates persistently.

One way you can save candidates is to use
'''`icicle-candidate-set-save'''', bound to '''`##C-M->##''''.  This saves ''all'' of the current candidates.

; ''Gotcha%%:%%'': If you use [[progressive completion]] and you have not yet typed anything after `##M-*##' or `S-SPC', then there is not yet a set of candidates to save.  If you use `##C-M->##' at that point, you will reset the saved candidates to ''none''.  To define the current candidates, either type something or use `S-TAB'.

Another way to save candidates, besides `##C-M->##', is to ''select'' candidates in
buffer `*Completions*' using the (active) [[region]], and then use
'''`icicle-candidate-set-save-selected'''', bound to '''`##C-M-)##''''.  This
saves any candidates that are at least partially in the region.

Command '''`icicle-mouse-candidate-set-save'''', bound to '''`M-S-mouse-3''''
in `*Completions*' combines these two: if the region is active, then
the ''selected'' candidates become the saved set; otherwise, ''all''
candidates are saved.  This binding makes it easy to save
candidates using the mouse: select them (e.g. drag or double-click `mouse-1', or click `mouse-1' then `mouse-3'), then use
`M-S-mouse-3' to save. [[#MouseNote|*]]

You can also use '''`##C-M-)##'''' to '''''un'''''save all candidates: just select no
candidates before you hit `##C-M-)##', to reset the set of saved
completions to none.  Think of this as replacing the saved set with the empty set (''no'' candidates).  And you need not use `TAB' or
`S-TAB' first to use this, since the current set of candidates is
not used in any way when you reset the saved set.

You can process the [[list]] of saved candidates in any way you like
using Emacs Lisp.  For example, you can save a list of file names
that match a regexp, then print the list or process the individual
files in some way.  Here, for instance, is how to save the set of
file names that contain either `dir' or `ici':

  C-x C-f \(dir\|ici\) S-TAB C-M-> C-g

You can retrieve a set of saved candidates with command
'''`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve'''', bound to '''`##C-M-<##''''.  This ''replaces''
the current set of candidates with those retrieved.  It also acts
like `##M-*##' by entering a recursive [[minibuffer]], which removes any
saved-candidates highlighting.  Using `TAB' or `S-TAB' restores
the highlighting.

What if you have defined the saved set and you later decide to narrow it
by excluding some of its members?  First, if the saved
candidates are not current then use `##C-M-<##' to make them so.   Then use [[progressive completion]]
to narrow the current candidates.  Then use `##C-M->##' to define (only) them as the saved candidates.  For example, if you hit
`##C-M->##' after narrowing to the files matching prefix `ici', you
can narrow that saved set to only those files that also match `m',
by using `##S-SPC m C-M->##'.












[:SaveOrRetrieveMore]
== Saving or Retrieving Additional Candidates ==

You can use '''`##C-<##'''' to retrieve a set of saved candidates and ''add''
them to the current candidates, instead of replacing those
candidates.  This way, you can build up the current set of
candidates by retrieving (combining) several saved sets.

In the other direction, you can save additional candidates, adding them to a set of candidates already saved, in these ways:

* '''`##C->##'''' ('''`icicle-candidate-set-save-more'''') adds all of the current candidates.

* '''`##C-)##'''' ('''`icicle-candidate-set-save-more-selected'''') adds any
candidates that you have selected using the region in
`*Completions*'.

* '''`M-mouse-3'''' ('''`icicle-mouse-candidate-set-save-more'''') acts the
same as `##C-)##' or `##C->##', depending on whether or not the region
is active in `*Completions*': it adds ''selected'' or ''all'' candidates.

* Extending the region with `mouse-3', and then clicking `mouse-3'
again in the same place, acts the same as `##C-)##'.  That is, click
`mouse-1', then click `mouse-3' twice in another location, to
save all candidates between the `mouse-1' and `mouse-3'
positions. [[#MouseNote|*]]

* The '''`insert'''' [[key]] ('''`##icicle-save/unsave-candidate##'''') adds just
  the current completion candidate (e.g. during [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]).  Clicking a candidate in buffer `*Completions*'
  with '''`M-S-mouse-2'''' ('''`##icicle-mouse-save/unsave-candidate##'''') does the same thing.  If you do this to a candidate that has already been saved, then it is '''''un'''''saved (no longer saved).

Note that the `insert' key and `M-S-mouse-2' are toggles for a
given candidate, saving or unsaving it.  In this sense each is its
own opposite.  In another sense, the opposite operation of saving
is simply removing a candidate from the current set of candidates.
You do that using the `delete' key or `S-mouse-2'.

Another way to add to the list of saved candidates is to use
'''`M-S'''' ('''`icicle-multi-inputs-save'''').  This is available for any minibuffer input, not just
during [[completion]].  It adds all of the [[multi-input]]s currently in
in the minibuffer to the set of saved candidates.
So you can, for
instance, use `M-S' on a minibuffer containing the following input, to add
its three file names to the current saved set of candidates in
variable `icicle-saved-completion-candidates'.

Matching, saving, and retrieving candidates is a powerful way to
interact with completion.  One important use is to prepare a [[list]]
of candidates on which to act, and then act on them all at once
using `##C-!##'.  This is a good way to proceed when you want to
double-check what to act on, before you actually act.  This is the
same idea behind marking files in [[DiredMode|Dired]] and then operating on the
marked files, using `x'.  It corresponds to what is represented in
some user interfaces by filling out a checklist followed by clicking `OK'.



[:MouseNote]
[* If you click `mouse-1' on a candidate and (starting with Emacs
22) `mouse-1-click-follows-link' is an integer, then you will need
to hold the mouse button depressed longer than that many seconds,
or else that candidate will simply by chosen.  If the value is
`t', then this will not work at all.  Any other value presents no
problem.  (Personally, I use `nil'.)]














[:SaveRetrieveWithVariable]
== Different Places for Saving and Retrieving Candidates ==

You can save completion candidates to a different
variable from `icicle-saved-completion-candidates' by using a
[[numeric prefix argument]] to command `icicle-candidate-set-save';
that is, use `##C-u ## '''''##N##''''' ## C-M->##'where '''''##N##''''' is an integer.  Alternatively, use '''`##C-M-}##'''', which is
bound to command '''`icicle-candidate-set-save-to-variable''''.

You are
prompted for the name of the variable, and you can use completion
when inputting it.  During this completion, the only available candidates are
variables that you have used for saved candidates (but completion
is [[lax]], so you can type a new variable name). The same
behavior works also for `##C->##', `##C-M-)##', and `##C-)##'.

To retrieve completion candidates that were previously saved to a
variable other than `icicle-saved-completion-candidates', so that
they become the current set of candidates, use `##C-u ## '''''##N##''''' ## C-M-<##',
where '''''##N##''''' is an integer, or '''`##C-M-{##''''  ('''`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve''''
or '''`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve-from-variable'''').

Using a plain [[prefix argument]] (`C-u' ''without'' a number)
with `##C-M->##' and `##C-M-<##' saves or retrieves a candidate
set using a ''cache file'', not a variable.  Alternatively, as a shortcut you can use '''`##C-}##'''' and '''`##C-{##'''' for this. See [[Icicles - Persistent Completions]] and [[Icicles - Support for Projects]].

When you save candidates to a different variable from
`icicle-saved-completion-candidates', they are not shown in buffer
`*Completions*' using face `icicle-saved-candidate'.  When you save
candidates to a cache file, they are also saved to
`icicle-saved-completion-candidates', so they are shown in
`*Completions*' using face `icicle-saved-candidate'.

`##C->##' and `##C-<##' accept the same prefix arguments as `##C-M->##' and
`##C-M-<##' , letting you specify the source or destination (variable,
cache file) when you save or retrieve additional candidates.

'''Note:''' Use the right type of saved candidates ([[Icicles - Persistent Completions|persistent]] or not) for a given command. It is the particular command that determines whether or not a given type of saved candidate is appropriate. For example, you can save search hits when you use `icicle-search-file' (same as `icicle-search' with a negative prefix arg), and those saved search-hit candidates effectively reference files and positions in those files. And you can later retrieve and reuse such saved candidates to visit the search positions. But those candidates are not merely file names, so they cannot be used with a command such as as `find-file' or `icicle-file' that expects a file name. Conversely, you cannot use a saved set of file names with a command such as `icicle-search-file' that expects `icicle-search' candidates. 










[:SavingMarkedFilesAndDirsInDired]
== Saving Marked Files and Dirs in Dired ==

Besides saving file and directory names that are completion
candidates on the fly, You can create or add to a saved set of
names using the names that are marked in [[Dired]].  The same keys
(e.g., `##C-M->##') that save candidates in the [[minibuffer]] during
[[completion]] save the marked names in Dired.

If you use library '''[[Dired+]]''' then you can also use the same keys,
but with the prefix key '''`##M-+##'''' (e.g. `##M-+ C-M->##') to save not only
the names that are marked in the current Dired buffer but also
those that are marked ''in any marked subdirectories, recursively''.
See [[Icicles - Dired Enhancements#SaveMarkedNamesHereAndBelow| Save Marked Names Here and Below]].














[:SetOperations]
== Set Operations ==

The other available set-operation commands for use with completion
candidates, besides saving and retrieving, are these:

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-save'''', bound to '''`##C-M->##''''.  '''''Save''''' the current
set of completion candidates, for use in a subsequent set
operation (see below). The saved set is not persistent; it is saved only until the next `##C-M->##' in the same Emacs session. 

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-retrieve'''', bound to '''`##C-M-<##''''.  '''''Retrieve''''' the saved set of completion candidates, making it the current set.

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-swap'''', bound to '''`##C-%##''''.  '''''Swap''''' the saved and current sets of completion candidates.

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-define'''', bound to '''`##C-:##''''.  '''''Define''''' the
current set of completion candidates by ''evaluating an input
[[sexp]]''.  The sexp must evaluate to a [[list]] of strings, such as is
returned by `all-completions'.  You can use this to substitute
''any list of strings'', and then operate on them as completions,
using any '''Icicles''' functionalities.  Keep in mind, however, that
the completions must be of the proper type for the context in
which they are used.  For example, if you are executing a
command, they must be [[command]] names.

[:icicle-candidate-set-complement]
* '''`icicle-candidate-set-complement'''', bound to '''`##C-~##''''.  '''''Complement'''''
the current set of candidates: replace the current candidate set
with its set complement.  This means all possible completions of
the appropriate type that do '''''not''''' match the current input.  You
can combine this with [[progressive completion]] (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to progressively eliminate candidates that
match different inputs. This ''process-of-elimination matching'' is a common '''Icicles''' usage idiom. 

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-union'''', bound to '''`##C-+##''''.  Replace the
current candidate set by its '''''union''''' with the saved set of
candidates.

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-difference'''', bound to '''`##C--##''''.  Replace the
current candidate set by its '''''set difference''''' with the saved set
of candidates.  That is, the saved candidates are subtracted
from the current candidates, and the result becomes the current
candidate set.   To obtain the opposite set difference,
subtracting the current candidates from the saved candidates,
just use `icicle-candidate-set-swap' followed by
`icicle-candidate-set-difference'.

* '''`icicle-candidate-set-intersection'''', bound to '''`C-*''''.  Replace
the current candidate set by its '''''intersection''''' with the saved
set of candidates.  Unlike the set intersection provided by `M-*' (or `S-SPC'),
`C-*' is, in itself, a one-time operation.  `M-*' (or `S-SPC') can be
repeated, using the previous intersection as one of the sets to
be intersected in a new operation.  Both `C-*' and `M-*' use the
current set of matching candidates as one of the sets being
intersected.  But `M-*' reads another input regexp to define the
other set to be intersected, whereas `C-*' uses the saved
candidates set as the other set.  `M-*' (or `S-SPC') is useful for chaining,
to achieve progressive approximation.  `C-*' is useful to
perform an intersection on a set from a previous input reading.

You can operate on or choose from all input values in the set that
results from any of these set operations.  For example, you can
use `##C-~##' to see the list of objects that do not match the current
input, to cycle among those objects, or to operate on any or all
of them.  Use `##C-~##' at any time to switch to the complement of the
current set of candidates.

'''Example:''' To cycle through all files whose names do ''not'' end in `el', you can do the following:

: '''1.''' Use `C-f' to read a file name.

: '''2.''' Type `##el$##' to match all file names that end in `el'.

: '''3.''' Use `S-TAB' to show the matching files.

: '''4.''' Use `##C-~##' to flip to the complement: files not ending in `##el##'.

: '''5.''' Use `next' or `prior' to cycle among the new set of candidates.

A minibuffer message briefly confirms each of the set operations.

When buffer `*Completions*' is displayed, the union, difference, and
intersection commands scroll the buffer when repeated.  Repeating `icicle-candidate-set-complement'
complements the complement, of course, giving the original set.

Once you have established a set of completion candidates using any
of the candidate-set commands, you can [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] among the candidates
of that set using either prefix or apropos cycling (`down', `up', `next', `prior', `end', or `home').  However, switching from prefix to
apropos cycling (or completion), or vice versa, establishes a
new completion set of the appropriate type, as usual.  Switching completion type signifies
that you are finished with the specially defined completion set,
and you want to redefine it using apropos or prefix cycling or
completion.

'''Note:''' Prefix icompletion  (##icomplete.el## or '''<tt>[[icomplete+.el]]</tt>''' - see [[Icicles - Icompletion]]) does ''not'' take into account the candidate set resulting from
a set operation: it always displays the normal
set of [[prefix completion]]s in the minibuffer.

'''Note:''' You might have noticed that, as a mnemonic device, the keys bound to the
various set operations use the corresponding ''binary arithmetic'' or
Boolean operators: `##~##' (unary negation) for complement (not); `##*##'
(multiplication) for intersection (and); `##+##' (addition) for union
(or); and `##-##' (subtraction) for difference.  Note too that the `##C--##' and `##C-+##' bindings
mean that you cannot use these [[key sequence]]s for prefix
arguments -- you must use `##C-u ##''##N##'' ', or `##M-##''##N##'' ' instead, where ''##N##''
is a possibly signed integer.









[:RecompletingUsingTheOriginalDomain]
[:C-xC-0]
[:icicle-recomplete-from-original-domain]
== Recompleting Using the Original Domain ==

Sometimes you want to perform an operation using a saved set of
candidates, and then you want to do something using the original
set of candidates provided by the command's completion domain.
For example, you might want to perform an action on selected files
from a saved candidate set, and then act on files that are not
necessarily in that set.

That is what '''`C-x C-0'''' (`icicle-recomplete-from-original-domain')
does: during completion, it forgets about the current set of
candidates and completes your input from scratch, using the
original domain of candidates.

This means that you can also use it after [[progressive completion]],
to pop up to the shallowest minibuffer level (1) and start over,
completing your current input from scratch.
