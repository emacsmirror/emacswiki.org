The ##nlinum.el## library, available from GNU ELPA (http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/nlinum.html) is meant as a replacement for LinumMode, using the jit-lock infrastructure to fix various corner case bugs, and aiming to be as fast or faster.

To precalculate the line number width to avoid horizontal jumps on scrolling:
<pre>
;; Preset `nlinum-format' for minimum width.
(defun my-nlinum-mode-hook ()
  (when nlinum-mode
    (setq-local nlinum-format
                (concat "%" (number-to-string
                             ;; Guesstimate number of buffer lines.
                             (ceiling (log (max 1 (/ (buffer-size) 80)) 10)))
                        "d"))))
(add-hook 'nlinum-mode-hook #'my-nlinum-mode-hook)
</pre>
