The built-in function `completing-read' prompts a user to select from a set of candidates, providing [[minibuffer]] [[completion]] to narrow and complete the user input.

==Related external packages==
===auto-completing-read===
[:auto-completing-read.el]
* <tt>[[auto-completing-read.el]]</tt> provides functions that are variants of `completing-read' and `ido-completing-read' designed to minimize the number of keystrokes needed to select an option.  You can use these functions in your own commands as replacements for `completing-read' and `ido-completing-read'.
===Helm===
* [[Helm]] provides a different completion interface from `completing-read', and alternative completion functions.
===Icicles===
* [[Icicles]] -- In Icicle [[minor mode]], `completing-read' is itself enhanced in many ways: optionally automatically completing as much as possible, and optionally automatically selecting the sole matching candidate.  Exiting Icicle mode returns `completing-read' to its original behavior.
