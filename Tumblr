== Tumblr ==

=== What: ===

This is a set of interactive function used to post to Tumblr. This uses Tumblr's simple HTTP-based API.
Author: Travis Jeffery

=== To use: ===

==== First: ====
M-x customize-group tumblr and change the variables to match your account.
You may also need to get http-get.el, http-post.el, and http-cookie.el.
You can get all three here: http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/http-emacs/http-emacs/

==== Then any one of: ====

<pre>
M-x tumblr-quick-post will allow you to make a quick post from the minibuffer
M-x tumblr-buffer-post will take all the text from the current buffer and send that to Tumblr and will ask you for the title. 
M-x tumblr-start-post will create a new buffer and setup is up for you to post, to send the post when you are done use M-x tumblr-post
</pre>

=== Future: ===
At the moment I'm content with just posting regular types however all the other types (photo, quote, link, chat, audio and video) can be added. Perhaps being able to retrieve and read posts as well.

=== Extension: ===

;; At the moment I'm content with just posting regular types as I use Tumblr as a blog, mainly. Also I think the other types are oriented for being in a browser anyway. So what I'm saying if is you want the other types code it yourself and post it on the site. And the same goes for reading posts (better suited for being in a broswer). Any improvements or advice is unwanted, even though my code is absolutely perfect in every way. There is not one recording of Travis Jeffery ever making a mistake, the problem is obviously attributed to your own error.
