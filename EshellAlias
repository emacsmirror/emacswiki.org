See also EshellFunctions for more elaborate examples.

== Reloading the aliases file ==

The eshell aliases are stored in a file whose name is in the variable ##eshell-aliases-file## (this defaults to something like ~/.emacs.d/eshell/aliases). If you edit it by hand then (as the manual says), you'll need to refresh eshell's cache of the values. To do this, run the ##eshell-read-aliases-list## function (which, of course, you can do by typing its name in eshell!)

== open file ==

I used this in my .emacs so that I can simply open file instead of
find-file.  This has the added advantage that I can M-x open file when
I can't remember what C-x C-f does ;P

    (defalias 'open 'find-file)
    (defalias 'openo 'find-file-other-window)

== Alias 'll' to 'ls -l' ==

Make sure that the positional parameters are included:

    ~ $ alias ll 'ls -l $*'

== Alias 'emacs' to 'find-file' ==

    ~ $ alias emacs 'find-file $1'

Note that without the quotes, the positional parameter will get lost:

    ~ $ alias emacs find-file $1
    ~ $ alias
    alias emacs find-file

Note also that $* will not work because `find-file' expects exactly one parameter.
Using $* instead of $1 will pass a list of parameters to find-file, and find-file will barf:

    ~ $ alias emacs 'find-file $*'
    ~ $ emacs test.txt
    Wrong type argument: stringp, ("test.txt")

Note, that $* will work with the following advice (put it into .emacs):

<pre>
(defadvice find-file (around find-files activate)
  "Also find all files within a list of files. This even works recursively."
  (if (listp filename)
      (loop for f in filename do (find-file f wildcards))
    ad-do-it))
</pre>

== Alias 'w3m' to 'w3m-find-file' ==

The same idea is for checking html files. I generate a lot of html 
documentation using Doxygen and want to see the document without leaving emacs.
If you have [[emacs-w3m]] and [[w3m]] installed; then you may want to alias 
w3m to w3m-find-file same as emacs to find-file:

    ~ $ alias w3m 'w3m-find-file $1'

== Alias 'clear' to 'recenter 0' ==

    ~ $ alias clear recenter 0

== What about permanent aliases? ==

The trick is that all aliases will be stored automatically, thus you
do not need to edit anything equivalent to your ##".bash_alias"## manually.
The variable `eshell-aliases-file' defines the file in which aliases are stored.
Refer to the comments in the source file ##"em-alias.el"## for details.

== More about permanent aliases ==

You also can define new eshell commands in your .emacs file. There is a simple example.
To define 'emacs' command as 'find-file' as above you may write:

      (defun eshell/emacs (file)
          (find-file file))

This way you can define pretty complicated functions 
using all emacs lisp power. From the other side, it may be just overkill 
for such simple definitions. See [[EshellFunctions]] for more information about this. --AntonKulchitsky

== Sharing aliases with bash ==
Many people have lines like this in their .bashrc file:
    alias ll='ls -l'
Eshell needs a different syntax:
    alias ll 'ls -l'
To integrate both, either:
* a) eshell accepts bash's syntax
* b) bash reads eshell's alias file
* c) both shells use a new neutral command which defines alias using the right syntax depending on the caller
* d) the user is forced to maintain two files, ideally with a script which can create one from the other

I have used solution d: I use a line in .bashrc which, after all aliases have been defined, creates the alias file for eshell (eshell-aliases-file):

    alias | sed -E "s/^alias ([^=]+)='(.*)'$/alias \1 \2 \$*/g; s/'\\\''/'/g;" >~/.emacs.d/eshell/alias 

This takes care of allowing eventual parameters ($*) and allows single quotes as part of the expanded alias.
That line takes only 0m0.007s so I don't mind running it each time I open bash.
