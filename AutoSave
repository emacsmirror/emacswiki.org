[[es:AutoGuardar]]
By default, Emacs automatically saves your changes to a file intermittently. If anything should happen, you can recover a file with `M-x recover-file'. Auto-saving can be turned on globally or on a per-buffer basis with `M-x auto-save-mode' (users of Emacs 26.1 and later may prefer `M-x auto-save-visited-mode').  Note that auto-saving and backing up are different concepts and serve different purposes.

See also the [[Manual:Auto Save]] (emacs) Emacs manual entry.

== Placing all files in one directory ==

By default, auto-save files are stored in the current directory with a file name on the form <tt>#<i>file</i>#</tt>. If you don't want to clutter up your file tree with Emacs' backup files, you can save them to a dedicated directory:

    (setq backup-directory-alist
          `(("." . ,(concat user-emacs-directory "backups"))))

Saving to the system's "##temp##" directory is also an option, though a dangerous one, since in regular Linux setups there's no guarantee that you will see those backups again:

    (setq backup-directory-alist
          `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
          `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))

This will place all auto-saves and [BackupDirectory backups] in the directory pointed to by ##temporary-file-directory## (e.g., ##C:/Temp/## on Windows, ##/tmp/## on Linux).

Or even more dramatic:

    ;; Save all tempfiles in $TMPDIR/emacs$UID/                                                        
    (defconst emacs-tmp-dir (expand-file-name (format "emacs%d" (user-uid)) temporary-file-directory))
    (setq backup-directory-alist
        `((".*" . ,emacs-tmp-dir)))
    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
        `((".*" ,emacs-tmp-dir t)))
    (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix
        emacs-tmp-dir)


== Delete auto-save files == 

* To delete all auto-save files in the current directory, use `<tt>#</tt>' in [[Dired]] to mark the files, then `x' to delete them.

* To recursively print and delete all auto-save files under the current directory, run:

    find -name "#*#" -print -delete

== Interlock symlinks and auto-save files ==

Be aware that symbolic links of the form ".#*" are not auto-save files but interlocks to prevent the simultaneous editing of the same file.
See Manual:Interlocking in the EmacsManual for details.

== Running save-buffer Automatically ==

For Emacs 26.1 and later:

As written in [[Manual:Auto Save Files]] (emacs):
[quote]
  If you want auto-saving to be done in the visited file rather than
in a separate auto-save file, enable the global minor mode
`auto-save-visited-mode'.  In this mode, auto-saving is identical to
explicit saving.

For older versions of Emacs, or for greater flexibility you can use a 3rd-party package:

=== After Some Time Interval via Idle Timers ===

https://github.com/ChillarAnand/real-auto-save - Automatically save your all your buffers/files at regular intervals in Emacs!

=== Save All Buffers on Auto-Save ===

I like using `auto-save-hook', and that seems to work well, but I want to save all the buffers, because if I switch away from a buffer before it autosaves, I want it to get saved when things next get saved after that. So I combined parts of the two above solutions (this is the first elisp code I’ve written, could have glaring problems):

{{{
(defun full-auto-save ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
      (set-buffer buf)
      (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p))
          (basic-save-buffer)))))
(add-hook 'auto-save-hook 'full-auto-save)
}}}

=== On Loss of Input Focus via Focus Hooks ===

New hooks for gain/loss of focus were added in Gnu Emacs 24.4: <code>focus-in-hook</code> and <code>focus-out-hook</code>.

If you are running a version of Emacs with these hooks, you can add

  (defun save-all ()
    (interactive)
    (save-some-buffers t))
  
  (add-hook 'focus-out-hook 'save-all)

to your .emacs file and it should save all files on loss of focus.

*Two things to note:*

These hooks fire when any Emacs frame gains or loses focus. This means that if you Alt-Tab or Alt-` between Emacs frames, the focus-out-hook and focus-in-hook will run. (MacOS and Windows have a concept of application-level focus, but X apparently does not. These hooks apply at the frame level so they can work on all three platforms.)

These hooks are intended for use by the end-user, not for use in packages. If you set these hooks for other people, they're likely to be annoyed. (Particularly if they are debugging Emacs itself or working in a "focus follows mouse" environment where merely mousing over a window switches focus to it.)

=== On User-Defined Signals ===

Another approach is tell emacs to do `full-auto-save' (defined above) when it receives the USR1 signal.
  
  (define-key special-event-map [sigusr1] #'full-auto-save)

Create a shell script to send the signal to emacs.
  
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  pkill -USR1 emacs

And tell your window manager to run the script whenever you switch windows.
I use sawfish and so:

  ;;.sawfish/rc code
  (defun save-emacs () 
    (system "save-emacs &"))
  (add-hook 'leave-workspace-hook save-emacs)
