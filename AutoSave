By default, Emacs automatically saves your changes to a file intermittently. If anything should happen, you can recover a file with `M-x recover-file'. Auto-saving can be turned on globally or on a per-buffer basis with `M-x auto-save-mode'.  Note that auto-saving and backing up are different concepts and serve different purposes.

See also the Emacs auto-save [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Auto-Save.html manual entry].

== Placing all files in one directory ==

By default, auto-save files are stored in the current directory with a file name on the form <tt>#<i>file</i>#</tt>. If you don't want to clutter up your file tree with Emacs' backup files, you can save them to the system's "##temp##" directory:

    (setq backup-directory-alist
          `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
          `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))

This will all place all auto-saves and [BackupDirectory backups] in the directory pointed to by ##temporary-file-directory## (e.g., ##C:/Temp/## on Windows).

Or even more dramatic:

    ;; Save all tempfiles in $TMPDIR/emacs$UID/                                                        
    (defconst emacs-tmp-dir (format "%s/%s%s/" temporary-file-directory "emacs" (user-uid)))
    (setq backup-directory-alist
        `((".*" . ,emacs-tmp-dir)))
    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
        `((".*" ,emacs-tmp-dir t)))
    (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix
        emacs-tmp-dir)

== Delete auto-save files ==

* To delete all auto-save files in the current directory, use `<tt>#</tt>' in [[Dired]] to mark the files, then `x' to delete them.

* To ''recursively'' delete all auto-save files under the current directory, run:

          find -name "#*#" | xargs rm

:: If the file names contain whitespace, it is necessary to use one of:

          find -name "#*#" -print0 | xargs -0 rm
          find -name "#*#" -exec rm {} \;

== Interlock symlinks and auto-save files ==

Be aware that symbolic links of the form ".#*" are not auto-save files but interlocks to prevent the simultaneous editing of the same file.
See the Emacs [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interlocking.html#Interlocking manual entry] for details.

== Discussion ==

How do I turn on auto-saving globally or on a per-buffer basis?

[new]
See [[Manual:Auto Save Control]], it should be on by default, but you can turn it off in a buffer with `M-x auto-save-mode'. -- AaronHawley

=== Problems with Tramp ===

Hello, I'm trying to use emacs to edit a file across a locally-mounted network file system. There is a long latency across the connection, so I need to minimize file accesses over the network. However, if I open file "abcd", emacs creates files like .#abcd, .#abcd.2, etc, in the directory housing the file. This makes things take forever, because each file creation/access in that directory goes across the network. How do I tell emacs to either not create those files, or at the least to create them in /tmp rather than in the same directory as the file? -- BayleShanks

[new] See auto-save-file-name-transforms. The default value matches all TRAMP URLs. With a little bit of tweaking, you can add another sexp for your locally-mounted network shares. I use the following incantation to save all my temporary files to another partition, as I occasionally have problems with my data partition.

   (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
         '(("\\`/[^/]*:\\([^/]*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)\\'" "/tmp/\\2" t)
          ("\\`/?\\([^/]*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)\\'" "/usr/local/sacha-backup/\\2" t)))

=== Disabling Auto Save ===

Every time I edit a file and then discard the changes emacs saves a ~/#filename# file. The next time I run emacs it warns me about it and advises me to recover the file. How can I disable this "feature" ?

[new]
: That is really two features, "auto save"(1) and "find-file warning messages"(2). Auto-save is easy to disable, just add (setq auto-save-default nil) to your .emacs file. The warning messages are a bit trickier to suppress. There's an optional parameter in find-file-noselect ...

=== Running save-buffer automatically ===

All these new-fangled IDEs tout that they automatically save your files for you. I think this would be cool to try out (my c-x c-s muscles get tired sometimes). You can set auto-save-visited-file-name to a non-nil value and emacs auto-save will save your work in the file you are working on instead of a separate file, but then the buffer is considered out of date and you can't continue editing without an annoying warning message. Is there a way around this? -- BryanMurdock

[new]
: What about `M-x run-with-idle-timer RET SECONDS RET save-buffer RET'? If that's what you want, then find a way to roll some EmacsLisp to make it work for all your buffers associated with files. Then you can put that in your DotEmacs and smoke it. -- AaronHawley

[new]
My emacs lisp skills are feeble, but how does this look?

   (defun save-buffer-if-visiting-file (&optional args)
      "Save the current buffer only if it is visiting a file"
      (interactive)
      (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p))
          (save-buffer args)))

   (add-hook 'auto-save-hook 'save-buffer-if-visiting-file)

It seems to work for me with both regular files and file you visited with tramp. -- BryanMurdock

[new]
Automatically save your changes after an customizable interval. Can be selectively applied some modes.

I really like this idea, because it's dumb to make me hit C-x C-s all the time because of technical details of the computer's architecture, and almost everything I edit is under version control anyway. I like using auto-save-hook, and that seems to work well, but I want to save *all* the buffers, because if I switch away from a buffer before it autosaves, I want it to get saved when things next get saved after that. So I combined parts of the two above solutions (this is the first elisp code I've written, could have glaring problems):

	(defun full-auto-save ()
	  (interactive)
	  (save-excursion
		(dolist (buf (buffer-list))
		  (set-buffer buf)
		  (if (and (buffer-file-name) (buffer-modified-p))
			  (basic-save-buffer)))))
	(add-hook 'auto-save-hook 'full-auto-save)

[new]
What about to save file when emacs frame loose focus? -- VitalieLazu
