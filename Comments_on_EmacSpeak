 With a little help from <code>#emacs</code> on ##irc.openprojects.net##, I found out that you should export the varibale ##DTK_TCL## like this: 
{{{
export DTK_TCL=/usr/bin/eflite
}}}

Assuming that you're running the *bash shell*, and that your eflite is located in ##/usr/bin/## -- lurwas

: Question: Can this be used with [[http://festvox.org/festival festival]]? --DavidMcCabe

Answer: I have successfully managed to emacspeak up and running Ubuntu gutsy gibbon by using the eflite package.  Install eflite flite emacspeak.  To configure the speech server to be used, use ##sudo emacspeakconfig## and pick ##eflite##.  Then run emacspeak via the ##alsa-oss## package "oss emacspeak".  You may have to install the alsa-oss package.

This is what I get on my Debian:

{{{
 /home/alex# dpkg-reconfigure emacspeak      
 Please enter the number of your choice:                                          
   1  DECtalk Express
   2  DECtalk Multivoice
   3  DECtalk 3
   4  Software DECtalk
   5  eflite
   6  ViaVoice Outloud
   o  other.  I can provide the filename
   a  abort, and restart configuration after
      installation of another speech server package
 Number [5]: 
}}}

Run "emacspeak" to open emacs with voice. In case of problems:
* check that your user is on the group "audio"
* check that you have rights to read and write /tmp/es.socket
* check that it can open /dev/dsp; if you don't have it, use the OSS emulation from ALSA, for instance with "aoss emacspeak"

More issues: 

* strange noises at the end of each letter
* after saying the current sentence, it can be heard a bit of other past sentences

How to solve them?

I just moved stuff over here from the main wiki page. These comments are much older than the timestamped ##2023-12-22##.
