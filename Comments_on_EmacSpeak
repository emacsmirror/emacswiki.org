: Question: Can this be used with festival (http://festvox.org/festival)? --DavidMcCabe

:: Answer: I have successfully managed to emacspeak up and running Ubuntu gutsy gibbon by using the eflite package.  Install eflite flite emacspeak.  To configure the speech server to be used, use sudo emacspeakconfig and pick eflite.  Then run emacspeak via the alsa-oss package "oss emacspeak".  You may have to install the alsa-oss package.

   2  DECtalk Multivoice
   3  DECtalk 3
   4  Software DECtalk
   5  eflite
   6  ViaVoice Outloud
   o  other.  I can provide the filename
   a  abort, and restart configuration after
      installation of another speech server package
 Number [5]:

Run "emacspeak" to open emacs with voice. In case of problems:
* check that your user is on the group "audio"
* check that you have rights to read and write /tmp/es.socket
* check that it can open /dev/dsp; if you don't have it, use the OSS emulation from ALSA, for instance with "aoss emacspeak"

More issues: 

* strange noises at the end of each letter
* after saying the current sentence, it can be heard a bit of other past sentences
