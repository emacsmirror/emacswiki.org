[[ko:버퍼]]

(This is a [[CategoryGlossary|glossary]] page. It is not for how-to information.)

An Emacs '''[::buffer]''' is similar to what other systems might call a ''file'', ''document'', ''workspace'' or ''editor''. A buffer can contain text and images.

Buffers are shown in [[window]]s on the screen.  A buffer can be displayed in more than one window at a time, or it might not be displayed at all.

At the bottom of each window is a ModeLine that describes the buffer and its state.  Every buffer has a unique ''buffer name''; the name is shown in the mode-line.

By default, *visiting* a file puts the file content into a buffer and displays it in a window.  By default, the buffer name is based on the (relative) file name.

*Saving* a buffer writes it to its visited file.   

*Killing* a buffer discards its contents.  By default, Emacs prompts you if there are unsaved changes.

By convention, buffers whose names start with an asterisk (##*##) are not associated with files.  For example, by default Emacs starts with an empty buffer named ##*scratch*##.  If such buffers have unsaved changes when you exit Emacs, these buffers are discarded without asking.

Buffers whose names start with a space are [[InvisibleBuffers|invisible]], which means they are hidden from many operations.  These buffers are typically created and used by Emacs for internal purposes.
