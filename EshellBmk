The code below is a hack to integrate Eshell and [[bookmark]]s, for changing directories. This could be integrated into eshell/cd (using a prefix like `:' in a similar way to how `=' can be used) but it was easier, especially considering completion, to create a new command. There is most certain room for enhancements and fixes, but it works quite well as it is. -- MaDa

Rather than complain that a specified bookmark is not a directory, I suggest that we just execute 'bookmark-jump' with the specified bookmark. In this way, more of the default bookmark functionality is available via eshell/bmk'. -- guivho
