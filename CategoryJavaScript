Emacs has 2 major Javascript modes:

* JavaScriptMode -- js-mode is a bare-bones mode built upon cc-mode.  It used to be called espresso-mode at one time, but got folded into the Emacs core
* [[Js2Mode]] -- js2-mode is a full blown IDE style mode, with its own parser.
* ECMAScriptMode -- another javascript mode, but it's last update was 2005.  You're likely better off using js-mode

There are also a number of ways to integrate with javascript subprocesses:

* SwankJs, a full-blown SlimeMode backend for [[NodeJs|node.js]] and can connect to a running web browser process through the socket.io package.  https://github.com/swank-js/swank-js
* [http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/ js-comint.el] is a lightweight comint integration package, that also seems to integrate with org-mode nicely. 
* JavascriptShell A REPL for Windows Scripting Host, and a [[Lisp:jsshell-bundle.el]]. It does simple completion on JS objects.
* WshRepl A decrepit console into the Windows Scripting Host from within Emacs.  It does have a project on github, and is looking for a maintainer
* ElnodeIJS, NicFerrier having a go at writing an Emacs to JavaScript shell. It uses comet for communication. Currently [[https://gist.github.com/4700573|here]] and in the [[Elnode]] source tree.
* [http://github.com/segv/jss jsSlime] provides an Emacs interface to the browser's debugger and javascript engine.

There are a number of helpful modes and elisp packages to working with javascript as well:
* FlymakeJavaScript
* [[Ejacs]], which is an Ecma-262 compliant Javascript interpreter written IN Emacs lisp
* QuickMode to execute your current JS buffer

Finally There are some specific modes available as well:
* GwtMuMaMo Multiple Major Mode (MuMaMo) for working with the Google Web Toolkit
* CouchdbDocument interacting with couchDB
* MozRepl -- A great way to hook into the lower level javascript engine of Mozilla.
* [http://flusspferd.github.com/ Flusspferd] provides a [https://github.com/ruediger/flusspferd/blob/master/misc/emacs/flusspferd.el mode for Emacs].

WishList:
* NPM and Ender package manager front-ends
* Lookups to the [http://www.javascripture.com/ Javascripture]

Waiting for a short summary:

* JavascriptShellServer
* [[JSON]]
* [[NodeJs]]
* TypeScript
