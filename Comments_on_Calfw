Is it really a good idea to put the whole Calfw README onto the wiki?  Do you have permission from, or are you the author?  As the wiki has a different license than whatever the Calfw READMEâ€™s is (GPLv3 I believe)?

Anyway the README is already over there, and can be linked to easily; the README is quite long, would it not be better to put up a summary of it here?
