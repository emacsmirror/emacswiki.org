Emacs supports bidirectional display out of the box since version 24.1. Just type in text in a R2L script such as hebrew or arabic.

Work started on the m17n.org website (discontinued).

TAKAHASHI Naoto and HANDA Kenichi wrote code to display Arabic
from Unicode and ISO-8859-6 correctly.  Those encodings use only one
character for the various glyphs (start, middle, end, isolated form),
so the display code needs to know about some basic Arabic rules to get
this right.  This is done using font-lock to identify the region of
interest and compose-region to compose any number of characters into
another character.

This means that enabling auto-composition-mode will enable font-lock.

You can download the m17n fonts from the emacs-bidi page.  You cannot
just switch to that new font, however.  If you do, your [[Frame]] sizes
will all be messed up.  Here is why, and what to do about it (thanks
to TAKAHASHI Naoto for the explanation):

Emacs calculates the frame size based on the FONTBOUNDINGBOX of its
ASCII font.  If you request Emacs to use the m17n font, it will use
the font not only for Arabic but for all characters, including ASCII
characters.  Since the m17n fonts are proportional fonts, some glyphs
are very wide and some glyphs are very tall.  Therefore its
FONTBOUNDINGBOX is very big.

Specify your favorite ASCII font for the default.  Then include the
following lines in your ~/.emacs file.

  (set-fontset-font
   "fontset-default"
   (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x0600) (decode-char 'ucs #x06ff)) ; arabic
   "-m17n-*--20-*-iso10646-1")
  (set-fontset-font
   "fontset-default"
   (cons (decode-char 'ucs #xfb50) (decode-char 'ucs #xfdff)) ; presentation A
   "-m17n-*--20-*-iso10646-1")
  (set-fontset-font
   "fontset-default"
   (cons (decode-char 'ucs #xfe70) (decode-char 'ucs #xfefc)) ; presentation B
   "-m17n-*--20-*-iso10646-1")
