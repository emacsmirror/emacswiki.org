This is a page to put in some BigBrotherDataBase (BBDB) importer hacks.

== Importing from LDIF ==

LDAP based tools and many address books understand LDIF format.

* http://www.diku.dk/~elgaard/lib/emacs/bbdb-ldif.el

This file seems ancient; I am not sure how well it supports current BBDB.

== Importing from XML ==

Norman Walsh published [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info@lists.sourceforge.net/msg03608.html xml2bbdb.pl] in 2003.

DaleSmith wrote this xsl file to convert from Sylpheed xml address format to bbdb: [http://home.roadrunner.com/~dsmich/sylpheed2bbdb.xsl sylpheed2bbdb.xsl].


== vCard Import == [:VcardImport]

=== With bbdb-vcard.el: === 

This importer imports vCards version 3.0 of (almost) arbitrary content into BBDB.

On a file, a buffer or a region containing one or more vCards, use
`bbdb-vcard-import-file', `bbdb-vcard-import-buffer', or
`bbdb-vcard-import-region' respectively to import them into BBDB.

Remember to call `bbdb-save' after importing to save your data.

There are two known versions:

* [https://github.com/tohojo/bbdb-vcard bbdb-vcard.el] by Toke Høiland-Jørgensen, last updated in 2012
* [http://github.com/trebb/bbdb-vcard bbdb-vcard.el] by Bert Burgemeister, last updated in 2010 (apparently suffering from some sort of bug?)


Cf. [[BbdbExporters#VcardExport]] for the export functionality of [http://github.com/trebb/bbdb-vcard bbdb-vcard.el].

=== With bbdb-vcard-snarf-buffer: ===

I emailed this to Chris for inclusion, as his version 0.1 importer didn't quite have this functionality:

    (defun bbdb-vcard-snarf-buffer ( buf )
      "Traverse BUF via regex.  Bbdb-snarf against each match."
      (let ((bbdb-current-point (point-min)))
        (switch-to-buffer buf)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "END:VCARD" nil (message "%s done" buf))
          (bbdb-vcard-snarf-region bbdb-current-point (point))
          (setq bbdb-current-point (point)))))

This requires [http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/vcard.el vcard.el] by NoahFriedman for the importer to work.

Based on this, Marcus Crestani wrote [http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/crestani/downloads/bbdb-vcard-import.el bbdb-vcard-import.el] that makes it easy to import vCards into your bbdb.  
If the file ~/vCards.vcf contains the vCards you like to import, do: 
<pre>
M-x bbdb-vcard-import RET ~/vCards.vcf RET
</pre>  

See [http://www.mail-archive.com/bbdb-info%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg04703.html this thread] on the bbdb-info mailinglist.

== Importing from ~/.mailrc ==

Importing the ~/.mailrc file, it's very simplistic, but did the trick
for me, I hope it helps other people too.  There is a slight
limitation, in that it expects *all* aliases to be at the top of the
file, but I guess that can be easily fixed.

    (defun my-import-dot-mailrc-to-bbdb ()
      "Imports the ~/.mailrc aliases into bbdb."
      (interactive)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert-file-contents (expand-file-name "~/.mailrc"))
        (goto-char (point-min)) ;; beginning-of-buffer (but faster)
        (while
    	(looking-at
    	 (concat "alias\\s-+\\(\\sw+\\(-\\sw+\\)?\\)\\s-+\"?"
    		 "\\([a-zA-Z0-9@. \t<>_-]*\\)\"?"))
          (eval '(bbdb-create-internal
    	      (buffer-substring (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1)) nil
    	      (buffer-substring (match-beginning 3) (match-end 3)) nil nil nil) )
          (forward-line))))

== Importing from CSV files & popular programs into bbdb 3 ==

Use bbdb-csv-import from melpa or from https://gitlab.com/iankelling/bbdb-csv-import and follow the simple instructions at the top of the file. Works with gmail, thunderbird, linkedin, outlook.com, easily extensible to more. It is well supported.

This project was created due to too many bugs in the bbdb 2 importer below. 
    
== Importing from CSV files into bbdb 2 ==

If you can manage to arrange your data in CSV (comma separated value) 
form, you can use ''lookout.el''. This package allows for importing calendar 
and address data from CSV files. ''lookout.el'' is available from http://ulf.epplejasper.de/EmacsCalendarAndDiary.html. You also need ''csv.el'' which can be found at http://ulf.epplejasper.de/EmacsGeneralPurpose.html.

For those too lazy to look through the code, the first line of your file should name each column. From the code:

<pre>
Key1,Key 2,"Key3"
Value1a,Value1b,"Value1c"
Value2a,Value2b,"Very long Value
2c"
</pre>
    gets translated into
<pre>
((("Key1" "Value1a") ("Key 2" "Value1b") ("Key3" "Value1c")) 
(("Key1" "Value2a") ("Key 2" "Value2b") ("Key3" "Very long Value
2c")))
</pre>

Then you define a variable to hold the mapping between the CSV columns and the BBDB fields. For example, I used:

    (defconst lookout-bbdb-mapping-table-maill-pl
      '(("lastname" "mname" "lname")
        ("firstname" "fname")
        ("company" "company")
        ("net" "email")
        ("phones" "phone1" "phone2")
        ("addr1" "addr1")
        ("addr2" "addr2")
        ("addr3" "addr3")
        ("otherfields" 
         "group" "group")
        ("notes" "Body"))
      "Mapping table, usable for input from the mailing list scraper, maill.pl")

Now you can set the mapping table by using the variable <code>lookout-bbdb-mapping-table</code> and you are good to actually import the data with <code>M-x lookout-create-bbdb</code>

== Importing from abook- and mutt-related formats ==

Right now I use mutt as my MUA and I want to switch to Gnus and BBDB (I have read Usenet News with Gnus many years). I know [http://abook.sourceforge.net/ abook].

abook can read these fileformats:

* abook abook native format
* ldif ldif / Netscape addressbook
* mutt mutt alias
* pine pine addressbook
* csv comma separated values

abook can write these formats:

* abook abook native format
* ldif ldif / Netscape addressbook (.4ld)
* mutt mutt alias
* html html document
* pine pine addressbook
* gcrd GnomeCard (VCard) addressbook
* csv comma separated values
* palmcsv Palm comma separated values
* elm elm alias
* text plain text
* spruce Spruce address book

Right now I have my E-Mail addressbook in mutt aliases-file. So, maybe I'll read it with abook and let it write it as VCard-format but CSV might be good intermediate format, too. There exist software that an import VCard to BBDB. And there is some software that can upload data from BBDB to GSM-phone via [http://www.gnokii.org/ gnokii].

== Importing from OS X system Address Book ==

I use Gnus as my mailer, but I live on a Macintosh.  To get the system AddressBook data into the BBDB, I've written a [http://www.homonculus.net/blog/by_name/bbdb_os_x_hackery.html short python script] that uses the PyObjC bridge to pull the relevant data directly.    Share and enjoy!
