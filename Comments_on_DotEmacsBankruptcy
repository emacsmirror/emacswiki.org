I would like to respectfully suggest that emacs dot file bankruptcy is no longer an issue. Most of what made it an
issue was when someone would try to update it somehow. Such as install a new package, and then three packages
already installed complained about things. And you don't know for sure if what you were trying to do worked or not.
Now there is excellent package management. And more than that. There is the combo of cask and pallet.
Yes there will always be people who get frustrated and start from scratch. But a massive number of people such
that it is a thing in this wiki? I think emacs has evolved past that.
