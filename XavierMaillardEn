Hi and welcome on my modest EmacsWiki page. I am XavierMaillard, a
french DBA spending his spare time hacking FreeSoftware (and editing
this place).

I am a FreeSoftware hacktivist.

I am member of a few associations related to FreeSoftware promotion and alterglobalisation:

* [http://april.org APRIL]
* [http://lolica.org LOLICA] <= discontinued (no more motivation)
* [http://attac.fr ATTAC France] <= discontinued (conflicted with positions)

I use GNU Emacs since ages (at least I feel I didn't use anything else :p) and love *Lisp language.

==Contact me==

* irc: [::xma] on the EmacsChannel (rare)
* mail: (rot13 "kzn@tah.bet") ;; (rather long to answer)
* mail2: (rot13 "knivre@znvyyneq.vz") ;; <- C-x C-e
* jabber ID: xavier@maillard.im (currently down: server blowned away :/)

== Modes I am using ==

=== Mail tasks ===

I have tested all mail modes for emacs from Gnus to MH-E but I am not
very interested in tweaking/sorting/archiving. I have to admit that
Gnus is marvelous but it is so huge that I spent my time
tweaking/hacking it thus I lost precious time.

MH-E was a good way to use NMH in Emacs but after some time of
thinking I have decided that, given the fact I was living 100% of my
time in Emacs, NMH layer was too much. NMH, though, is quite a cool
mail handling system I would recommend for any serious shell user.

In the end, RmailMode is really what I need(ed). It is simple, basic
but pretty efficient.

=== IM ===

I used to only use IRC but as time goes, I am more and more using
Jabber. Thus my client of choice is JabberEl. For the rare occasions I
am under IRC, I am using [[rcirc]].

=== NNTP ===

Gnus, all is said.

=== Notes and organization ===

Once again, I have tried so many modes always trying to have the
perfect tools that I spent too much time playing with the setup.

Why did I switch to howm ? I like free-form notes taking tool. Plus,
howm is really powerfull to search *anything* *at any given time*
*anywhere* into my notes. To my knowing, this is the only one tool
doing this. The big cons is its lack of documentation.

What I like about it:

# free form notes
# awesome searching capabilities (nothing can beat it at this)
# looks like a wiki (perfect for me)
# extensible easily
# is a MinorMode

What I dislike:

# small community
# documentation is in japanese :/

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-17 18:57 UTC]
After months of howm, howm sounds less interesting for these reasons:

# I am duplicating many note content everywhere (codes, ...)
# Saving one note can take really long (due to huge amount of notes)
# Searching is not really useful since some system daemon could do
  that (and even more and better -i.e rlocate for example and this
  could be made available via [[Anything]])

I am more and more using topic-oriented notes -i.e. notes about sql,
about free software, ... I am huge fan of EevMode which is of great
help for that but going that way also means to renounce to HowmMode
and to choose something different, something working with the One Big
File approach.

=== Other modes ===

In unsorted order:

* InteractivelyDoThings
* OddmuseMode (current Maintainer)
* InPlaceAnnotations (current Maintainer)
* ColorTheme (current maintainer)

* NeroEl (maintaining a fork)
* VC
* PredictiveMode
* EevMode (can't live without it)
* [[Anything]] (new and really fun)
* RecordsMode (current maintainer)

As You have surelly seen, I principaly deal with Gnus stuff. This may
be why I am the current maintener/webmaster of gnusfr.org
(http://www.gnusfr.org). This site is dedicated to the french gnus
users community.
I am also the new official maintainer of the French User Emacs website (http://www.emacsfr.org)
I am also in charge of the french translation of the gnus documentation

[new] Welcome! ;) -- AlexSchroeder
[new] re [[rcircEncoding]]: That's what I get for not updating the page with the latest debugged version. Your fix is what I have in my init file, too. :) I also note that you are a lousy blogger, based on what I see in the section below. -- AlexSchroeder

=== Questions ===

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-01-12 21:16 UTC]
How can I redirect to a page anchor in EmacsWiki ? Thank you.

[new:rubikitch:2009-01-16 18:23 UTC]
I saw your posting that you are a heavy user of InPlaceAnnotations. Please let me see your setting/code of InPlaceAnnotations if you prefer? I use org-remember to note when I read code. I'm interested in the integration of InPlaceAnnotations and OrgMode/RememberMode. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-17 18:57 UTC]
I do not have configuration for InPlaceAnnotation. I am just using it
everywhere to store "post-it" (todo, reminders, ...). I asked for
maintainership to be able to have ... maintainance (or add feature,
etc.). If you have code for integration with OrgMode, just post it
here. I have setup a darcs repository. I plan to make it public (I
will probably add read/write to any contributor).

[new:XavierMaillard:2014-06-09 21:43 UTC]
Are there any good personal journal org-mode based tutorial available somewhere ? I'd like to see how users do it. Thank You.

=== Blog & my website ===

No blog, no website or at least nothing serious.
