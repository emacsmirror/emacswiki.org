Hi and welcome on my modest EmacsWiki page. I am XavierMaillard, a
french guy spending his spare time hacking FreeSoftware (and editing
this place).

I am a FreeSoftware hacktivist.

I am member of a few associations related to FreeSoftware promotion and alterglobalisation:

* [http://april.org APRIL] <= discontinued (no more time)
* [http://lolica.org LOLICA] <= discontinued (no more motivation)
* [http://attac.fr ATTAC France] <= discontinued (conflicted with positions)

I use GNU Emacs since ages (at least I feel I didn't use anything else :p) and love *Lisp language.
In fact I got away for a long time and getting back since 2025.

==Contact me==

* irc: [::xma] on the EmacsChannel (rare)
* mail: (rot13 "kzn@tah.bet") ;; (rather long to answer)
* mail2: (rot13 "knivre@znvyyneq.vz") ;; <- C-x C-e

== Modes I am using ==

* RmailMode what else ?
* HowmMode can't explain why but in this chaos, I am fine and feel comfident
* InteractivelyDoThings
* OddmuseMode
* ShellMode
* VC
* EevMode (need to checkout if it is still working for me, doubt it)

=== Page initiated ===

As You have surelly seen, I principaly deal with Gnus stuff. This may
be why I am the current maintener/webmaster of gnusfr.org
(http://www.gnusfr.org). This site is dedicated to the french gnus
users community.
I am also the new official maintainer of the French User Emacs website (http://www.emacsfr.org)
I am also in charge of the french translation of the gnus documentation

[new] Welcome! ;) -- AlexSchroeder
[new] re [[rcircEncoding]]: That's what I get for not updating the page with the latest debugged version. Your fix is what I have in my init file, too. :) I also note that you are a lousy blogger, based on what I see in the section below. -- AlexSchroeder

=== Questions ===

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-01-12 21:16 UTC]
How can I redirect to a page anchor in EmacsWiki ? Thank you.

[new:rubikitch:2009-01-16 18:23 UTC]
I saw your posting that you are a heavy user of InPlaceAnnotations. Please let me see your setting/code of InPlaceAnnotations if you prefer? I use org-remember to note when I read code. I'm interested in the integration of InPlaceAnnotations and OrgMode/RememberMode. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-17 18:57 UTC]
I do not have configuration for InPlaceAnnotation. I am just using it
everywhere to store "post-it" (todo, reminders, ...). I asked for
maintainership to be able to have ... maintainance (or add feature,
etc.). If you have code for integration with OrgMode, just post it
here. I have setup a darcs repository. I plan to make it public (I
will probably add read/write to any contributor).

[new:XavierMaillard:2014-06-09 21:43 UTC]
Are there any good personal journal org-mode based tutorial available somewhere ? I'd like to see how users do it. Thank You.

=== Blog & my website ===

This can't be considered a serious thing, but, I recently cleaned up some things and I am running an OddMuse instance at [[https://www.maillard.im]]. It is housing something like a blog and editings by my sons (currently not online).
