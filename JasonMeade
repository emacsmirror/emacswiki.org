I'm just another hacker.

Here are a list of files that I've uploaded:

[[bug.el]] An antiquated file for compiling ant based Java projects.

[[fetch.el]] Another antiquated file for hyperlinking between class files in Java projects.

[[slurp.el]] Search for files using regular expressions.

[[logr.el]]. A simple logging tool.

GNU Emacs is my editor of choice.

I work mainly in Java, JavaScript and SQL, but Lisp, Scheme and TCL hold a special place in my heart. ;-)
