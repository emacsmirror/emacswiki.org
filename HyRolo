%%HyRolo%% is a fast, hierarchical record-based contact manager that is part
of the GNU [[Hyperbole]] package.  The text of each record is completely
free-form and full-text searches are done during lookups so any record
with a matching term is always found.

%%HyRolo%% manages and searches rolo files.  A "rolo file" consists of an
optional header that starts and ends with a line of equal signs (at
least three equal signs starting at the beginning of a line), followed
by zero or more rolo records.  You must manually add a header to any
rolo file if you want it to have one.

Here is an example of a simple rolo file.  The date at the end is
automatically added by %%HyRolo%% whenever a new record is added.

     ==================================================================

We call rolo records, "entries".  Entries begin with a delimiter of
one or more '*' characters at the beginning of a line.  Entries may be
arranged in a hierarchy, where child entries start with one more '*'
character than do their parents.  Top-level entries begin with a single
'*'.

Beyond this initial delimiter, entries are completely free-form text.
It is best to use a "lastname, firstname" format, however, when adding
contact entries into a rolo.  Then %%HyRolo%% will automatically keep your
entries alphabetized as you enter them.  Then you can sort the entries
if you ever need.  This ordering is what the rolo will use if you accept
the default entry with which it prompts you when adding a new entry.

Any search done on the rolo scans the full text of each entry.
During a search, the rolo file header separator lines and anything in
between are appended to the buffer of matched entries before any entries
are retrieved from the file.  Whenever an entry is matched, it and all
of its descendant entries are retrieved.  If your emacs version supports
textual highlighting, each search match is highlighted for quick, visual
location.

For example, a search on "Company" could retrieve the following:

     ==================================================================
                             COMPANY ROLO
     ==================================================================
     *    Company
     **     Manager
     ***      Staffer

Thus, searching for Company retrieves all listed employees.  Searching
for Manager turns up all Staffer entries.
