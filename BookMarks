This page is about Emacs '''[::bookmark]s'''. Bookmarks record locations so you can return to them later.  




== Introduction ==

Emacs bookmarking makes use of three things that are related but different: a bookmark ''list'', a bookmark ''file'', and a bookmark-list ''display''.  Understanding these is important to using Emacs bookmarks.  They are explained at [[BookmarkPlus#BookmarkBasics|Bookmark Basics]].

Some bookmarking commands to get you started:

* `C-x r m' -- set a bookmark at the current location (e.g. in a file)
* `C-x r b' -- jump to a bookmark
* `C-x r l' -- list your bookmarks
* `M-x bookmark-delete' -- delete a bookmark by name

Your personal bookmark file is defined by [[option]] `bookmark-default-file', which defaults to `##~/.emacs.bmk##'.  The file is maintained automatically by Emacs as you create, change, and delete bookmarks.

([[Bookmark+]] makes it easy to have multiple bookmark files -- different sets of bookmarks for different uses.)




[:BookmarkList]
== `*Bookmark List*' ==

The bookmark list (buffer `##*Bookmark List*##') is like [[DiredMode|Dired]] or BufferMenu for bookmarks.  You access it using `C-x r l'. (Emacs sometimes calls it the "bookmark ''menu'' list", which is a misnomer.)

Some keys in `##*Bookmark List*##':

* `a' -- show annotation for the current bookmark
* `A' -- show all annotations for your bookmarks
* `d' -- mark various entries for deletion (`x' -- to delete them)
* `e' -- edit the annotation for the current bookmark
* `m' -- mark various entries for display and other operations, (`v' -- to visit)
* `o' -- visit the current bookmark in another window, keeping the bookmark list open 
* `C-o' -- switch to the current bookmark in another window
* `r' -- rename the current bookmark


== Info Bookmarks and Virtual Books ==

You can bookmark [[InfoMode|Info]] nodes also -- just use `C-x r m', as usual. Command `bookmark-bmenu-list', bound to `C-x r l', provides a convenient menu to access bookmarks.


== Access File Bookmarks from `C-x C-f' ==

If you hit `C-x C-f' and then realize that you want a file that is bookmarked, you can get to the bookmark this way:

 (defun bookmark-to-abbrevs ()
   "Create abbrevs based on `bookmark-alist'."
   (dolist (bookmark bookmark-alist)
   (let* ((name (car bookmark))
          (file (bookmark-get-filename name)))
     (define-abbrev global-abbrev-table name file))))

I did not realize how to use this until I googled and found the original post where the poster mentioned using C-x a e (expand-abbrev) and RET on the find-file prompt. Now, if we could make find-file grok this more or less automatically too... :) -- MathiasDahl

[new:DrewAdams:2010-07-02 16:24 UTC]
You can do the same thing (access a file bookmark from `C-x C-f' etc.) with Icicles -- just hit `C-x m'.  See [[Icicles - File-Name Input]]. -- DrewAdams



== bookmark-add.el ==

Lisp:bookmark-add.el creates a buffer for working with bookmarks. Written by EugeneMarkov

* `M-x bookmark-open-in-simply-buffer' -- switch to <nowiki>*Bookmark list*</nowiki>.

* `M-x bookmark-set-add' -- Add this bookmark to bookmarks list. To use history, hit Up and Down. The first Up inserts expression which is near to a point.

* `M-x bookmark-jump-next-cyclic', `M-x bookmark-jump-prev-cyclic'  -- Cycle bookmarks.

* `M-x bookmark-jump-backwards' -- Move to last [[cursor]] position right after uses of commands `bookmark-jump-next-cyclic' and
`bookmark-jump-prev-cyclic'.


== Put Last-Selected Bookmark on Top ==

Using this method you'll find frequently used bookmarks easily (cho-seiri-hou in Japanese). -- [[rubikitch]]

<pre>
(defadvice bookmark-jump (after bookmark-jump activate)
  (let ((latest (bookmark-get-bookmark bookmark)))
    (setq bookmark-alist (delq latest bookmark-alist))
    (add-to-list 'bookmark-alist latest)))
</pre>



== Org Mode as a Bookmark Manager ==

I like to use OrgMode and RememberMode to keep my bookmarks for me. Just
visit a file/web page/email and then do `M-x remember' and add the
item to a ##bookmarks.org## file. With it's clever hierarchy handling you
can keep bookmarks well organised for different projects.



== Syncing Bookmarks with zsh ==

##zsh## has a feature called `cd-able-vars' which is similar to bookmarks but limited to directories on the local machine. Here's some code to convert emacs' bookmarks into code for zsh. First add this to your .zshrc:

    setopt cd_able_vars
    [[ -r ~/.zsh.bmk ]] && source ~/.zsh.bmk

Add this to your .emacs:

    (defadvice bookmark-write-file 
      (after local-directory-bookmarks-to-zsh-advice activate)
      (local-directory-bookmarks-to-zsh))

    (defun local-directory-bookmarks-to-zsh () 
      (interactive)
      (when (and (require 'tramp nil t)
                 (require 'bookmark nil t))
        (set-buffer (find-file-noselect "~/.zsh.bmk" t t))
        (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
        (insert "# -*- mode:sh -*-\n")
        (let (collect-names)
          (mapc (lambda (item)
                  (let ((name (replace-regexp-in-string "-" "_" (car item)))
                        (file (cdr (assoc 'filename 
                                           (if (cddr item) item (cadr item))))))
                    (when (and (not (tramp-tramp-file-p file))
                               (file-directory-p file))
                      (setq collect-names (cons (concat "~" name) collect-names))
                      (insert (format "%s=\"%s\"\n" name (expand-file-name file) name)))))
                bookmark-alist)
          (insert ": " (mapconcat 'identity collect-names " ") "\n"))
        (let ((backup-inhibited t)) (save-buffer))
        (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))


== Info Bookmarks ==

You can bookmark [[Info]] nodes.  As an alternative, you can use [[Info+]] to create a virtual Info book and use Info to navigate its nodes. If you also use [[Icicles]] you can have any number of ''persistent'' virtual Info books.

 

[:CyclingBookmarks]
== Cycling Among Bookmarks ==

* [[Bookmark+]] lets you cycle among any set of bookmarks, including visible (highlighted) bookmarks.

* DoReMi command `doremi-bookmarks' lets you cycle among bookmarks using the up and down arrow keys or a mouse wheel.

* [[Icicles]] command `icicle-bookmark' lets you [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] cycle among bookmarks.  Narrow the candidates using [[completion]].

* Lisp:bookmark-add.el lets you cycle among bookmarks.

* VisibleBookmarks lets you cycle among visible bookmarks.
