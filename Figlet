== two versions ==
* http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/content/emacs.html - Philip Jackson
** Given a prefix, a font can be chosen (C-u M-x figlet...)
** Leaves no trailing space (including blank lines)
** Provides several ways of inserting text:
*** `figlet'
*** `figlet-comment'
*** `figlet-figletify-region'
*** `figlet-figletify-region-comment'
* http://www.figlet.org/figlet.el - Martin Giese

Each small, each has their benefits. The Giese version handles parameters better, but dumps everything into a comment by default.
