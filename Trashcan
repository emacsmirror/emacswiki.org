Trashcan implements a recoverable file-deletion system that behaves like the trash can or recycle bin of many operating systems.

*NOTE*: Starting with Emacs 23.2, we have built-in support for using Recycle Bin or system Trash folder.  See NEWS by pressing `C-h n'.

You can find a copy of Trashcan on its [http://davin.50webs.com/research/2006/trashcan.el.html homepage]
or in [http://davin.50webs.com/research/2006/trashcan-20150105-102908.tar.gz this tarball].

From the commentary:

: This system changes the behaviour of the "x" key in dired mode from
permanently deleting files to a two stage system. If you are not in
a trashcan directory, then the selected files are moved into a
trashcan directory. If you are already in a trashcan directory, the
the selected files are permanently deleted. Files in a trashcan
directory can be restored by viewing that directory in dired mode,
selecting some files and executing the command M-x
trashcan-restore. All of the files in a trashcan directory can also
be permanently deleted in one hit by issuing the command M-x
trashcan-empty. The name "trashcan" comes from my old Amiga
Computer which I still have fond memories of!
