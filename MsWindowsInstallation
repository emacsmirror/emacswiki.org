== GNU Emacs on MS Windows ==

There are several distributions of binaries of Gnu-Emacs for
MS-Windows to choose from, see [[CategoryWThirtyTwo#toc1]].

There are two general flavours: native Windows and Cygwin builds.  The latter have drawbacks as detailed [[#below]],
so the guidelines here are only about the native Windows builds.

==Guidelines for installing Emacs on MS Windows==

To install the *official stable binaries*:

* Visit https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/windows/ 
* Consider reading the README
* Find the highest Emacs version directory
* Download the last zip-file ending in x86_64.zip for 64 bit or i686.zip for 32 bit listed
* Open it using Explorer (slow) or 7zip (faster) and extract all the files into a directory of your choice

*Note*: The 27.2 pre-packaged binaries come with an older GnuTLS library version with a known problem that could wrongly refuse connections to sites, such as MELPA, with a "certificate has expired" error. See https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=51038 for a discussion. 

To install the *official snapshot binaries*:

* Visit https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/
* Download the installer.exe with the latest date (again with x86_64 and i686 indicating 64 bit or 32 bit, respectively)
* Run the executable to extract the Emacs installation into the directory of your choice.
* Alternatively, you can download snapshots in zip format, like for the stable release.

If installing the *snapshot* "emax64" version from !SourceForge:

: Visit the site https://ntemacs.sourceforge.io/ and download the .7z file marked
  "binary" near the bottom.  Once downloaded, unzip it to a directory of your
  choice (e.g. ##c:\packages##).  A directory named emaxw64 will be created
  therein.

A subdirectory of the one just created will be ##/bin/##. Enter this bin-directory and run ##addpm.exe##
(takes only a second). A shortcut to ##.../bin/runemacs.exe## will be created in the
/Start Menu/ (/Programs -- Gnu Emacs â€“ Emacs/). If you are using Vista you /must/ run
##addpm.exe## as an administrator, otherwise the registry entries will not be created.

=== Problems with Cygwin distributed Emacs ===
[:below]There are three versions of Gnu-Emacs
distributed with Cygwin, 21.2.12, 21.2.13 and 22.1.3. All of these have (some)
drawbacks. Without X-Windows they only run in the bash-command window where started, and
at least in some settings the Window painting is garbled. To enable Emacs running in its
own window one must install X-Windows, and in addition open an /xterm/-window and start
Emacs from there. The xterm-window does not honour national keyboards (at least without
some twitching).

==Setting up Emacs on MS Windows==

This section describes two of the more important steps for setting up Emacs on
MS-Windows: The /home directory/ and the /starting directory/. In addition, MS-Windows
users may want to change the initial /size/ and /position/ of the Emacs window, the /font/
and /colours/ used, the /indentation behaviour/ when editing programs, the behaviour of
/regions/ selected with the mouse, and last but not least they may want to redefine
keyboard shortcuts to be more like what is traditional in MS-Windows. Customization of
these features is described in MsWindowsCustomize.

When run by selecting the shortcut, by default Emacs starts in the bin subdirectory of the
installation folder. When started from a command line, it starts in the current
directory. In both cases, the /home/ directory (aka ##~##, where customization files are read from, in
particular the ##.emacs## file) is set to ##C:\Documents and Settings\##/user/##\Application
Data## (on Vista it is set to ##C:\Users\##/user/##\AppData\Roaming##). It is possible to stick
with this default behaviour and place customization files in Application Data, but here
it is assumed that the default is changed. To take an
example assume that Cygwin has been set up and the user's home directory for Cygwin is
##c:\cygwin\home\smith## (or cygwinized: ##/home/smith##). It might be natural to make
this the home directory for Emacs and make it start there (in the following replace
##smith## with your username).

*Changing the directory where Emacs starts:* Right-click on the icon (shortcut) used to
start Emacs, select /Properties/, and type ##c:\cygwin\home\smith## into 
/Shorcut -- Start in/.

[:HomeDirectory]*Setting the home directory:* Select
/My Computer -- Advanced -- Environment variables -- System variables -- New/
and enter ##HOME## as the variable name and
##c:\cygwin\home\smith## as its value. See also MsWindowsDotEmacs.

*Setting the home directory on Vista:* Open the /Control Panel/. If you are using /Classic View/
open /User Accounts/ and then select /Change my environment varaibles/ from the Task Pane. If
you are using the default view of /Control Panel/, you have to select /User Accounts and Family Safety/
before you can select /User Accounts/. Either way, set up the ##HOME## environment variable as
described above.  See also MsWindowsDotEmacs.

*Integration with Windows Shell:* If you're using Win7 or later and Emacs24, check out EmacsMsWindowsIntegration for how to start Emacs from a shortcut, use it to open file types, etc.
