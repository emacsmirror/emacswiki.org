A cron job synchronizes the EmacsWiki setup to a machine that [[zeus]] is running.
You can use rsync to get copies from there. Note that the setup does not contain
files that can be read as-is. You will need a webserver and [http://www.oddmuse.org/ Oddmuse]
to read them!

List what's available:

{{{
rsync theshire.emacs.cl::
}}}

The actual site is less useful when Emacs Wiki dropped off the net but it's still available while the site is up:

{{{
rsync emacswiki.org::
}}}

Here's how to get or update a copy into the ##emacswiki## directory, for example:

{{{
mkdir emacswiki
cd emacswiki
rsync -avz --no-perms theshire.emacs.cl::emacswiki .
}}}

== What will you get? ==

You will get the files you need to run your own copy of the wiki.
Actually getting the wiki to run is going to require some [http://www.oddmuse.org/ Oddmuse]
and webserver experience.

*emacswiki* is the data directory. This is what you'd store in a database, if you wanted to.

*emacswiki.org* is the document root of the web site.

As for what to expect:

{{{
kensanata@theshire:~$ du -sh emacswiki emacswiki.org
1.4G	emacswiki
57M	emacswiki.org
}}}
