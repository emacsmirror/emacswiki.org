[http://users.snap.net.nz/~nickrob/#GDBMI gdb-mi] is a package by Nick
Roberts which makes Emacs use GDB/MI interface to talk with the GNU
Debugger. <code>gdb-mi</code> is currently in Emacs trunk, replacing 
the old <code>gdb-ui</code> package in GNU Emacs.

«[https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2009/dzhus/5649050225344512
Emacs GDB/MI migration]» is one of two Emacs-related projects which were
[http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/karlberry accepted] for 
GoogleSummerOfCode 2009 program.

The goal of this project is to migrate the GDB graphical interface in
Emacs to completely use GDB's Machine Interface (GDB/MI). This will
make GDB support in Emacs more robust and will allow using of GDB 
features available only with MI.

The development is carried out by //Dmitry Dzhus// under mentorship of
//Nick Roberts//.

= What's new? =

This section provides an overview of new user-visible features
implemented during Google Summer of Code. This draft serves as a base 
for updated section of the Emacs manual (see «GDB Graphical Interface»).

Note that the development version of *GDB 7.0* is needed for this
package to work (<code>-thread-info</code> command, non-stop debugging
support).

=== Stateless debugging ===

With MI, the notion of «current thread» is not so important as it
provides means to query information for any thread without actually
selecting it. This means that much more current thread selection logic
may be implemented in the frontend without relying on the internal
state of the debugger.

It's now possible to observe information for several threads
simultaneously (in addition to buffers which show information for
currently selected thread). Select threads buffer by clicking
«Threads» button or using <code>gdb-display-threads-buffer</code>
command. Now you can ask Emacs to show information for thread under
point using these keybindings, either using the current frame or creating a new one:

; d: gdb-display-disassembly-for-thread
; f: gdb-display-stack-for-thread
; l: gdb-display-locals-for-thread
; r: gdb-display-registers-for-thread

; D: gdb-frame-disassembly-for-thread
; F: gdb-frame-stack-for-thread
; L: gdb-frame-locals-for-thread
; R: gdb-frame-registers-for-thread

(Typing <code>C-h m</code> in threads list buffer will also give you this list.)

When you create a buffer showing information about some specific
thread, it becomes «bound» to that thread and keeps showing actual
information while you debug your program.

=== Non-stop debugging ===

; All-stop debugging: When one thread stops (hitting a breakpoint or
  recieving a signal), all threads stop.

; Non-stop debugging: When one thread stops, the rest continue
  running.

Non-stop debugging is much less intrusive.

To activate non-stop mode, set <code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code>
customization variables to <code>t</code>. Note that changing this
while debugging a program has no effect.

By default, when a thread stops in non-stop mode, Emacs automatically
switches to that thread.

It may be undesirable to let Emacs switch current thread when you
already have some other stopped thread selected. Set
<code>gdb-switch-when-another-stopped</code> to <code>nil</code> to
prevent this.

Emacs can decide whether or not to switch to stopped thread depending
on the reason which caused the stop. Customize
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> to select stop reasons which make
Emacs switch thread.

<code>gdb-stopped-hooks</code> hook variable allows you to execute
your functions whenever some thread stops. For example:

{{{
(defun my-gdb-stopped-hook (record)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*debug-stop-log*")
    (insert
     (format "%s stopped in %s (%s)\n"
             (gdb-get-field record 'thread-id)
             (gdb-get-field record 'frame 'func)
             (gdb-get-field record 'reason)))))

(add-to-list 'gdb-stopped-hooks #'my-gdb-stopped-hook)
}}}

In non-stop mode, you can switch between different modes for GUD
execution control commands.

; Non-stop/A: When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is
  <code>t</code> (that's default), interruption & continuation
  commands apply to //all// threads, so you can halt or continue all
  your threads with one command (<code>gud-stop-subjob</code> and
  <code>gud-cont</code>, respectively). Go button is shown on the
  toolbar when at least one thread is stopped, whereas Stop button is
  shown when at least one thread is running.

; Non-stop/T: Nil <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> value means
  that only current thread is stopped/continued. Go/Stop buttons on
  the GUD toolbar are shown depending on the state of current thread.

Stepping commands always apply to current thread.

=== Fine thread control ===

In non-stop mode, you can interrupt/continue your threads without
selecting them. Hitting <code>i</code> in threads list buffer
interrupts thread under point, <code>c</code> continues it,
<code>s</code> steps through. More commands may be added in the
future.

Note that when you interrupt a thread, it stops with «Signal received»
reason. If that reason is included in your
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> (it is by default), Emacs will switch
to that thread.

Given that you can create bound buffers for any thread, this allows
you to observe state of many threads in the same time.

You can customize what fields are included in stack frames list and
threads list by changing options in <code>gdb-buffers</code>
customization group.

== Development plan ==

The following has been done for <code>gdb-mi.el</code> during Summer of Code 2009.

Implemented buffers for:

# Threads

# Disassembly

# Program memory sections

Major goals:

# Made it possible watch information for several threads simultaneously

# Added non-stop debugging support

Internals (you don't want to read this):

# Got closer to MVC (<code>gdb-buf-publisher</code> provides a cleaner way to ask buffers to update; we maintain <code>gdb-breakpoints-list</code> and <code>gdb-threads-list</code>; we're still tied to «one buffer — one handler» model)

# Most of code now uses JSON parser instead of regular expressions to parse MI responses.

# Handle all MI async records

== Force gdb-mi not to set windows as dedicated ==

<code>gdb-mi.el</code> sets all its windows to be dedicated by default which meanst that if one tries to switch-buffer in one of <code>gdb-mi.el</code>'s dedicated windows selected the buffer will appear in a different window instead. When gdb-many-windows is disabled this is rather annoying so here's a quick fix using advice to override <code>gdb-mi.el</code>'s window dedication.

{{{
;; Force gdb-mi to not dedicate any windows
(defadvice gdb-display-buffer (after undedicate-gdb-display-buffer)
  (set-window-dedicated-p ad-return-value nil))
(ad-activate 'gdb-display-buffer)

(defadvice gdb-set-window-buffer (after undedicate-gdb-set-window-buffer (name &optional ignore-dedi window))
  (set-window-dedicated-p window nil))
(ad-activate 'gdb-set-window-buffer)
}}}
