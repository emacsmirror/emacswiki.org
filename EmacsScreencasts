Screencasts are videos of screen capture. The video shows changes on the screen while programming or executing some task. 

Emacs screencasts are videos of emacs in use. They offer a fun way to learn about Emacs usage by looking at experts using or demonstrating new features. It is also revealing to see how these experts use emacs for routine tasks while they go about demonstrating new features. Though some screencasts are only visual, without sound, they nevertheless reveal some useful patterns. Learning from screencasts is like looking over the expert's shoulder and silently watching them work.

There are a number of ways of learning, but screencasts have proven unmatched for demonstrating complex command sequences in easy to see, low-cost method.

== Tips about Creating Screencasts ==

* ScreencastMode (everywhere, but only inside Emacs) and ScreencastRecord (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD - ogg, ie only open formats) are modes for creating screencasts from within Emacs easily.

* Derek Slager used CommandLogMode (everywhere, but only inside Emacs) to create a screencast.

* See also [http://www.debugmode.com/wink/ wink] (freeware w32, creates flash video, is it ok to link to it here? An open source version is on its [http://groups.google.com/group/wink-discuss/browse_thread/thread/42812132e43573a0 way].)
