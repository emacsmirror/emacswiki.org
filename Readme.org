##    Bug fix for syncing history

* Library Information
* Using org-readme
Org readme is used to:

- Create/Update a "History" section in the Readme.org based on the changelog
  section of the Emacs Log.
- Create/Update a "Library Information" Section Based on the Emacs lisp header.
- Create/Update a "Possible Dependencies" Section Based on the Emacs
  lisp header.

All other sections of the Readme.org are then put into the
"Commentary" section of the readme.org.

In addition this library defines =org-readme-sync=,  a convenience function that:

- Asks for a commentary about the library change.
- Syncs the Readme.org with the lisp file as described above.
- Updates emacswiki with the library description and the library itself.
- Updates the git repository with the differences that you posted.
