I use GNU Emacs.

I've used this wiki extensively as a great source of information for quite some time now, so I figure it's about time I try and add some now...

I also idle in EmacsChannel using the handle "kodein".

I sometimes blog at http://busk.blogs.lysator.liu.se/ when I have time and a subject.
