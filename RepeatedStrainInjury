Using computers for extended periods can cause Repeated (or
Repetitive) Strain
Injuries or [::RSI].  It is not clear what causes them.  The control
or the
shift keys in the wrong position?  Wrong position of the hands?  Use
of the mouse?  People have been typing for years and RSI is a pretty
recent phenomenon.  But that just means that it was not known by the
name of RSI.  It doesn't prove that RSI didn't exist.  In many
countries, RSI is not recognized as a work-related injury; thus, this
may prevent you from collecting on your damage insurance.

* On devices:
** For experiences with Emacs and particular keyboards, see GoodKeyboards and Wiki:ErgonomicKeyboard (keyboards, pedals, etc.)
** FootSwitches for Control key and other frequently used keys. For example I use two Usb pedals: one for Ctrl key, the other for Shift key, Shift+Space is bound to RET, and CapsLock for Backspace. This way I solved the problem with RSI. -- SewerynKokot
* Hacking keyboards:
** Use [https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad Kmonad] to reprogram your keyboard to your heart's content. Configuring a [https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods home row mod] is a good start.
** Keyboard Layouts are discussed in MovingTheCtrlKey, SwapControlAltAndCapsLock, CapsKey, Wiki:DvorakKeyboard
** Using space bar as both space and control.
*** If you press the space bar alone, it inserts a space. If you press it together with another key, it acts as a control key. You can achieve this by using [https://gitlab.com/at-home-modifier/at-home-modifier-evdev/wikis/home at-home-modifier] in X (Linux only), or using [https://github.com/alols/xcape xcape] + xmodmap. And for MS Windows, AutoHotKey with [https://github.com/benhansenslc/BigCtrl BigCtrl] script. And for Mac, [http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html keyremap4macbook].
** Japanese keyboard ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Japanese Wikipedia article]) has many keys that you can press with thumbs, to which you can bind modifiers. For example, the bottom row of Japanese keyboard can work as <nowiki>[alt][shift][ctrl][shift][alt]</nowiki> *and* <nowiki>[Esc][Bs][Space][Enter][Tab]</nowiki>, /all/ pressed by thumbs.
** [[Evil]] whips up [ViKeys Vim keys] in Emacs.
** StickyModifiers reduce chording, as do FootSwitches; a GamePad controller, accessible through the JoyStick interface, can use chording but not in such a painful way
** Functions to avoid RepeatingCommands by hand reduce repetitive movements.
** Ergonomic keybindings for cursor movement, see ErgoMovementMode
* ShortTalk is a SpeechToText system that may help.
* EmacsVersor (Versatile Cursor) lets you get more out of each
keystroke of the arrow and simple command keys (DEL etc) and can be
used to put much of your input activity onto FootSwitches
* Software that reminds the user to take breaks every //n// minutes can be
lifesaving.  Try TypeBreakMode.
** X11 Users can try xwrits [http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/xwrits/],
!DrWright, etc.
** German users can consider switching to the Neo keyboard layout: [https://www.neo-layout.org] – This layout offers a more ergonomic position of certain keys, especially if you are programing.
** For Emacs, it can help to map certain key combinations, e.g. C-x to right Shift, so that you don’t have to press multiple keys at the same time so often.
** GNOME 2.4 users can try Applications->Desktop
Preferences->Keyboard->Typing Break.
** Another cool program is Workrave [http://www.workrave.org/welcome/]
(shows excercises too and lot of features).
** Debian: apt-cache search injury

home from work ...

People who've had wrist pains:

DavidMcCabe, ZajcevEvgeny, ShaeErisson, RichardKlinda, YannHodique,
JohnSturdy, XueFuqiao

Most of the discomfort I was having (felt like the tendons in the back
of my hands) has been aleviated by attempting to keep the muscle
tension required to 'float' my fingers and hands above the keyboard to
a minimum.  So, for me, the problem wasn't striking the keys, but
actually the reverse.  But there are other pains, especially after a
busy day.  In some cases I've found there may be an almost
psychosomatic response, where even touching the keyboard is painful.

When in one of the many what could be considered 'View' modes I may
try one or more of the following:

1. Try pressing keys in a different way:
: thumbs, pinkies, elbows, fists, toes, heels, etc.? (See FootSwitches
-- JohnSturdy)

2. Try using other objects:
: maybe a couple of pens
: chopsticks

3. VoiceRecognition
: still don't have this setup for myself

Here is my story.  I was having very bad RSI year in past.  Pain
starts in fingers going along whole forearm to the elbow.  It was
really painfull to type more than 20 minutes.  I start depositing
bee's poison on arms covering it with woolen gloves when typing, as
doctor recommend me.  After nearly month pain retreat a little, but
still after typing more then 30 minutes it starts again.  I type much
and pretty fast, so I decided to switch to dvorak keyboard layout and
bought KinesisKeyboard, make some ergonomic key remaps, also drop
using mouse at all, and continue depositing bee's poison every
morning.  After about 6 month pain retreat at all, now I can type 6
hours without any pain, but still have habbit to make break after 20
minutes :) -- ZajcevEvgeny

I noticed that moving to a lower chair drastically increases my
problems within two hours.
Thus, experimenting with chairs and table height might help.
Most of all, however, working less is what helped:

John Ousterhout, UC Berkeley comp sci prof., creator of influential
Tcl, and pioneer advocate of dynamic scripting languages (kinda like
Lisp, I understand ;)), has some very interesting pointers on Dealing
with RSI: https://web.archive.org/web/20080706183059/http://home.pacbell.net/ouster/wrist.html  Sobering thoughts
on prognosis for improvement; amazing personal experiences and
strategies for using Dragon Dictate Naturally Speaking:
http://www.scansoft.com/naturallyspeaking/ Windows only, and
expensive, alas, but it is as good as they say.  I trained my
neurologically disabled niece on an earlier version of it way back in
1997 and even then it was obviously a truly fabulous, if proprietary,
learning algorithm.  (I have one word of advice: unlike my young
niece, exercize great patience and moderate your expectations and
emotions while in training mode or you will surely and unconsciously
screw up your voice somehow with each initially frustrating iteration,
and thereby permanently screw up the neural net's ability to recognize
your natural speaking voice.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Worked fine
when I trained it on myself -- of course, my voice betrayed no
psychological need to make it work now, or never.  Perfectly natural
reaction to pain and powerlessness, but be on your guard.  This
technology may well be your lifeline: treat it with an air of natural
reverence, indifference if you will,  by just assuming it will answer
your prayers, in its own good time. </preacher-mode> )  Ousterhout
uses Naturally Speaking on a spare Windows laptop and pipes its ascii
outut to a networked Unix box's standard input, achieving speeds
*faster* than he could ever type, and he was a fast touch typist.  He
links to a2x, a free ascii-to-X windows utility, useful for making
Windows-only best of breed voice recognition software talk to Unix,
right at point in Emacs, presumably:

Reading The Mindbody Prescription

Getting fit is one of the most helpful things. Some forms of RSI may
be circulation-related, and things which help the circulation often
reduce RSI. Keep a small dumbbell by your computer, and lift it a few
times if your arms/hands/wrists start getting stiff.

FootSwitches, at least for Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and preferably also for
some other keys (EmacsVersor) make a big difference -- no more
hand-stretching chording. I use the kind designed by Xkeys
(http://www.xkeys.com/xkeys/xkfoot.php) but they are re-badged under
various names.
-- JohnSturdy

I started to experience bad RSI when I first used emacs. The chording was simply too awkward. I swapped my CapsLock and CTRL keys and that made it a bit better. Then I tried to create more ergonomic key bindings. I looked into FootSwitches, but they were too expensive. Finally, I switched to ViperMode and that made all the difference. To my delight, I found that a bit of tweaking made ViperMode even easier to use than Vim. For instance, instead of the awful "gqap" in vim to format/fill paragraphs, I set the following:

       (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map (kbd "q") 'fill-paragraph)

Now I have all the basic vi commands + an overlay of wonderful C-c commands in various modes + multiple undo and search commands. To me, it is the best of both worlds.

Emacs, of course, is infinitely more powerful than vi(m). Despite emacs' painful default keybindings, customizing it to make it as comfortable as possible is well worth the effort.

Random tips (although the people needing them most can't get to them):

* Tape restricting the distance between my pinky and ring finger on each hand has helped me break the reaching habit,
modifiers with one hand, letter-key with the other.
* "It's not Carpal Tunnel" is another good book, also "Explain Pain", but there is no definitive information out there.
* Doctors and other medical professionals vary in quality and up-to-date-ness enormously, sometimes with serious consequences.  As RSI crosses specialty boundaries, it is hard to get the full picture.
* I've removed the keypad and put a trackball in it's place
* Endep - formerly used as an antidepressant, is now used at a low dose to calm your hyper-reactive nervous system (dorsal root ganglion?).  This made the biggest difference in my case.
