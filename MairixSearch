== Usage ==

With ##mairix.el##, you can call mairix from within Emacs to search and
index your mails. Currently, [[Rmail]], [[Gnus]] and [[ViewMail|VM]] are supported to display the
search results (mbox format). However, mairix.el tries to be pretty
general so that it should be easy to integrate other Emacs mail programs
as well. For details, see the documentation and the source.

: Attention Gnus users: if you use Gnus with Maildir/MH, use the native
back end nnmairix.el instead. See GnusMairix for details.
