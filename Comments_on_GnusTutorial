Gnus did not subscribe me to any groups automatically. Is that still valid?

All the discussion of different mail backends really de-emphasizes IMAP, which I would bet is the most common way people have of accessing mail these days.  If this is supposed to be an easy tutorial I might put the IMAP stuff in the main flow and segregate all of those backend details in another section.

This procedure doesn’t work for me http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusTutorial#toc14
because there’s no `?’ available after `C-h ?'

Sorry about all the major changes. I do feel like this tutorial is excessively verbose and poorly formatted, considering the audience.

The table of contents is daunting, and the length of this webpage gives off the impression that LOTS of research is required to start using Gnus.

In reality, the relatively small amount of important info is buried under walls of verbose musings. 

The lack of text formatting, such as ##code## and *bold* text, makes skimming though difficult as well.

I'm trying to keep some of the funnier jokes, but for the most part I've taken it upon myself to turn this into an "over the weekend" tutorial, not so much an "over summer vacation" tutorial.

I can't find ##force yes## anywhere else on the Web, regarding ##~/.authinfo##, as per:

{{{
machine mail.example.com login laura@example.com password passw0rd port 587 force yes

# 'force yes' forces a username connection over anonymous.
}}}

The word "force" doesn't show up in the auth-source manual, or in ##auth-source.el##. I'm going to remove it for the time being, but I'm keeping a comment if I/we need to add it back.
