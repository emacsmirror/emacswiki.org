'''SLIME''' is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode, Enhanced.

See also CLiki:SLIME and its project page at http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/.

It is based on EmacsLisp magic by EricMarsden (who called it SLIM) to highlight CLiki:CMUCL error/warning/compiler note output directly in the Lisp editing buffer. LukeGorrie and HelmutEller added control of the Lisp process similar to that found in Distel, CLiki:CMUCL XREF support, good debugger interaction, and many other Lisp interaction enhancements. Most people consider it superior to ILispMode. It has been ported to CLiki:OpenMCL, CLiki:SBCL, CLiki:ACL, CLiki:LispWorks, though support varies a bit between implementations (with CLiki:CMUCL and CLiki:SBCL being the best).

Marco Baringer made [http://www.guba.com/watch/3000054867 a video] for this mode; 
Peter Christensen wrote [http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/reference-for-the-slimelispemacs-screencast/ an annotated reference guide] for the tutorial video.

== Fontify *SLIME Description* buffer for SBCL ==

    (defun slime-description-fontify ()
      "Fontify sections of SLIME Description."
      (with-current-buffer "*SLIME Description*"
        (highlight-regexp
         (concat "^Function:\\|"
                 "^Macro-function:\\|"
                 "^Its associated name.+?) is\\|"
                 "^The .+'s arguments are:\\|"
                 "^Function documentation:$\\|"
                 "^Its.+\\(is\\|are\\):\\|"
                 "^On.+it was compiled from:$")
         'hi-green-b)))

    (defadvice slime-show-description (after slime-description-fontify activate)
      "Fontify sections of SLIME Description."
      (slime-description-fontify))

It is easy to adjust to other CL implementations. -- [[rubikitch]]

== Improve usability of slime-apropos: slime-apropos-minor-mode ==

      (interactive)
      (let ((pt (point)))
        (forward-line 1)

            (goto-char (match-beginning 0))

== UsageMemo with SLIME ==
UsageMemo enables you to write annotation in *Help* and *SLIME Description*. TAKE A NOTE IN *SLIME Description*! -- [[rubikitch]]

== Fix end-of-defun's behavior in repl mode ==
After (require 'slime), eval follow form.
(defun slime-repl-mode-end-of-defun ()
  (forward-sexp)
  t)

== Remove SLIME's keybinding on C-c x ==
Emacs's elisp documentaiton states that "Sequences consisting of `C-c' and a letter (either upper or lower case) are reserved for users; they are the *only* sequences reserved for users, so do not block them." Unfortunately, slime binds `C-c x' to slime-export-symbol-at-point, shadowing any keybindings the user might have established via global-set-key. 

To remove slime's keybinding, and expose your original keybinding, add the following form after your call to (require 'slime) or (require 'slime-autoloads)

  (add-hook 'slime-mode-hook 
            (defun slime-sanitize-bindings ()
              "Removes SLIME's keybinding on C-c x"
              (cond ((boundp 'slime-mode-map)
                     (define-key slime-mode-map (kbd "C-c x") nil)
                     (message "slime keybinding on C-c x has been sanitized"))
                    ('t (message "slime keybindings not sanitized")))))

== Integrate yas/expand to TAB key ==
slime-indent-and-complete-symbol is a good function to bind to TAB key, but if you use Yasnippet, you can let TAB do indent, complete and yas/expand.

    (defun slime-tab ()
      "slime-mode tab dwim, either indent, complete symbol or yas/expand"
      (interactive)
      (let ((r (slime-indent-and-complete-symbol)))
        (unless r
          (yas/expand))))

    (defun my-slime-mode-hook ()
      (interactive)
      (define-key slime-mode-map (kbd "<tab>")
        'slime-tab)
      )
    (add-hook 'slime-mode-hook 'my-slime-mode-hook)
