Hey everyone, 
 
I recently stumbled upon a coin called HGL on the TON network, and I found its address: EQASgMtBU2QP9JMRfR1jKeLcPMUUT2RGigp_cVcjQuCyaZDw 
There are some whispers that this coin might see some significant developments soon, but it's still pretty low-key. Here's the link I found on GeckoTerminal: https://www.geckoterminal.com/ton/pools/EQBPaJg_cqZ25-ZRBPOBXWh9uCXGTcOxkvDLgRALL6n2L4y2 
 
I got a bit curious and bought a small amount since the price is still quite low. Has anyone here heard anything about HGL or know more about what's going on with this project? Would love to hear your thoughts! 
 
Thanks!
