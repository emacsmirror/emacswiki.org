The basic mechanism for spellchecking in Emacs involves the external program ispell/aspell.  For information on using this, see InteractiveSpell. There are also some alternatives:

* FlySpell mode runs ispell/aspell in the background and highlights misspelled words as you type.

* SpeckMode is similar to FlySpell but it only corrects words when you stop typing and allows you to use different dictionaries in the same buffer.

* WcheckMode is a fast general-purpose on-the-fly (spell-)checker interface which can use external programs or Emacs Lisp functions as the text-checker engine. It works not only with Ispell, Enchant, Hunspell etc. but also many other line-oriented command-line text-filtering programs and shell scripts. Wcheck mode is highly configurable.

* AutoCorrection corrects misspellings automatically as you type.

There are a number of packages that will help you if you use several different languages, either in different buffers, or mixed together in the same buffer.

These pages offer spelling help:

* FlyspellBabel -- Switch flyspell language according to LaTeX
Babel commands.

* AutoDictionaryMode -- Yet another dictionary guesser.  Works during idle time and supports self-updating templates.

* AutoLangMode -- Guesses the language of the current buffer/paragraph from content.

* GuessLang -- Similar guessing from content, but only for a whole buffer.

* GuessBufferLanguage -- A simpler approach for guessing the language of a buffer.

* WikiSpell -- GuessBufferLanguage adapted for use with Wikis.

* [[Synonyms]] -- One way to check spelling is to look words up in a dictionary -- or, in this case, a thesaurus. You can also check spelling by displaying matching completions, without bothering to look for synonyms.

* If you already use [[Icicles]] and [[Synonyms]], then you can quickly check the spelling of a word (if it is in the thesaurus!) with command `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry'. I bind it to `##C-c /##'. If the word is correctly spelled, it appears as a complete completion (is highlighted as such in the minibuffer).

* PredictiveMode -- In-buffer completion of words from a dictionary (British English dictionary included). Completions are, of course, spelled correctly. Especially useful when auto-complete and dynamic-completion are enabled (the default). This helps with those long, awkward, illogically spelled words English loves to taunt you with.

* SpellNumber -- Spell out an integer or currency in words. It is multi-language and multi-country.

* CocoAspell -- Using cocoAspell on Mac OSX.

* GnusSpelling -- Switching dictionaries depending on group parameters in Gnus.

* AspellWindows -- Setting up Aspell under Windows7.
