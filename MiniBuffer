The '''[::minibuffer]''' is a special [[buffer]] for entering [[command]]s or input arguments to commands.  It appears either in a separate, standalone [[frame]] or at the bottom of each frame. 

Sometimes, the area where you input commands is used to display informative messages without requesting input (i.e., not just a prompt).  When this area is used this way, it is called the '''EchoArea''', not the minibuffer.

In many respects, the minibuffer is a buffer like any other: You can edit the text you are inputting there. Most editing [[KeySequence]]s are available for this, including SearchingTheMinibuffer.  It's also possible to [ResizeMinibuffer resize the minibuffer].

Everything you enter in the minibuffer using `RET' (commands, input arguments) is added to a MinibufferHistory. There are generally different histories for the names of different object types that you enter: files, [[buffer]]s, [[command]]s... You can retrieve names from the currently used history to edit and reuse.

To cancel whatever you're doing in the minibuffer, use `C-g'. To cancel minibuffer if your focus is in another window, try the command `abort-recursive-edit' which by default is bound to `##C-]##'.  

The following command returns the focus to the minibuffer, no matter which window is currently selected.  This avoids repeatedly using `C-x o' (`other-window').
{{{
(defun switch-to-minibuffer ()
  "Switch to minibuffer window."
  (interactive)
  (if (active-minibuffer-window)
      (select-frame-set-input-focus (window-frame (active-minibuffer-window)))
      (select-window (active-minibuffer-window))
    (error "Minibuffer is not active")))

(global-set-key "\C-co" 'switch-to-minibuffer) ;; Bind to `C-c o'
}}}
