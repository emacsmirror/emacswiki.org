Options to undo filling, i.e. remove all line-endings from a paragraph
* UnfillParagraph, UnwrapLine -- take a paragraph and turn it into one long line
* Repeatedly applying `delete-indentation' (<kbd>M-^</kbd>)
* Set `fill-column' to a really large value and run `fill-paragraph'
* Create a custom function:

 (defun unfill-buffer ()
   "Undo filling for all paragraphs."
   (interactive)
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (let ((fill-column 99999))
     (fill-paragraph nil)
     (while (< (point) (point-max))
       (forward-paragraph)
       (fill-paragraph nil))))
