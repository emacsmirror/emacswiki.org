<b>NOTE: ##scheme-lookup## is mostly unmaintained.</b>

The best way to lookup [[Scheme]] symbols and read about them is with InfoMode and InfoLook.  This is setup in Emacs by default. In Scheme Mode buffers, typing `C-h S' will search the R5RS for the the symbol at point.

The R5RS must be installed to your InfoPath:

    http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/scm/

(Above link needs further instructions)

== Instalation ==

Scheme-lookup was a modified version of <code>hyperspec.el</code>, seeded with symbols from R5RS, finalized SRFIs and the manuals of several Scheme systems.
  
It allows to simply put the TextCursor over a symbol and say ##M-x scheme-lookup## to jump to the relevant documentation.

To get scheme-lookup do

  darcs get http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/canon/scheme-lookup/

then follow the instructions at the top of ##scheme-lookup.el##

(Above Link has been dead since 2009-10-31).

Since scheme-lookup was dead, NumaTortolero wrote the Lisp:r5rs.el simple file to browse documentation from the R5RS Revised5 Report on Scheme Programing language.
