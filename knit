[:Tips]
== little tips ==
* ##M-z x## - delete chars until ##x##
* ##M-m##   - First non-whitespace character on this line
* ##C-c <letter>## is reserved for the user to bind
* ##f5## to ##f9## are also reserved for you :3
* ##f3## starts recording a key macro. ##f4## stops it
* i bind arrow keys to select frames

== theming ==

i use ModusThemes because they're really cute :D

i install the package from melpa because it's a newer version.

[[https://tildegit.org/knit/init-el/src/branch/main/config/theme.el see my theme config here!]]

as for fonts i use [[https://github.com/protesilaos/iosevka-comfy iosevka comfy]]:

{{{
(defvar main-font   "Iosevka Comfy-16")
(defvar serif-font  "Iosevka Comfy Motion-16")
(defvar vari-font   "Iosevka Comfy Motion Duo-16")

(use-package emacs
  :custom-face
  (default            ((t (:font ,main-font))))
  (mode-line          ((t (:font ,serif-font))))
  (mode-line-inactive ((t (:font ,serif-font))))
  (variable-pitch     ((t (:font ,vari-font))))
  (fixed-pitch-serif  ((t (:font ,serif-font)))))
}}}

== bookmarking ==

I customize my bookmarks to categorize them by file. see [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks#h5o-4 this section]] of the wiki page about it.

i also set 'quick keys' for choosing a bookmark file; see [[https://tildegit.org/knit/init-el/src/branch/main/config/bookmark-conf.el#L61 my bookmarks config]] on gitea.

== org ==

i use orgmode to handle my todo lists, notes, time-sensitive deadlines, and writing documentation.

* use ##visual-fill-column## for a cozy softwrapped width (you can also center the text)
* ##org-hide-emphasis-markers## -- cleanup asterisks around bold text, etc.
* ##org-use-quick-tag-selection## -- use a single key to pick a tag, for speedy tag :3
* ##org-startup-folded## -- collapse all headings by default pls!

== capture ==

I use org-capture to send notes and links, and add todos to my agenda directory.

i press ##C-o t## to add a TODO heading to my ##todo.txt## file, which is then visible on my ##org-agenda## timeline :3 :3 ;3 ;3

I use the agenda to keep track of all my captured todo headings and find my tags / dates and whatnot.

i also use org capture to keep a diary!

== ibuffer ==

i just use ibuffer normally, which is more confusing than you'd think :3

id like to be able to run a command to add a mode to an ibuffer group

== Smaller ==

=== swatch beats ===

I use [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InternetTime#h5o-2 Alex's formatter] to render swatch .beat internet time.

=== oddmuse mode ===

I use [[Oddmuse_Mode]] by Alex cause it's probably the most updated :3
