I love the colored text, I love the status (PHPs:OK) or (PHPs:Error). I absolutely hate the (Special) buffer that splits the window or switches buffers in another pane.  It pops up everytime I am too slow to close a quote string, closes parenthesis or braces.  If I start a command and want to use the mouse to paste some other code from another buffer (common when working with SQL) then I am constantly hitting ^X1 or having to go reset the other buffer so I can see the code I wanted to paste from.  I KNOW I will need to close a quote, the status mentioned above tells me that. It would be nice to have a mode to stop that.  Instead I have to edit phps-mode-lex-analyzer.el and comment out the (display-warning...) statements.
