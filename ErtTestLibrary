'''ERT''' is an '''E'''macs Lisp library for '''r'''egression/unit '''t'''esting. It is now included in Emacs trunk, but can still be retrieved from its [http://github.com/ohler/ert old repository].

For examples of how to write tests with ERT, take a look at its [http://github.com/ohler/ert/tree/bc51e3e8121d51dc88618847f0958e7ec832c7d2/doc/misc Texinfo documentation], or at ERT's own tests in ##ert-tests.el## at the above URL.

== Discussion ==

LennartBorgman has written ##ert2.el## ("additions to ##ert.el##"), which contains functions for emulating the command loop and setting up a file/buffer to play with. It was distributed with [[NxhtmlMode|nXhtml]], but has since been integrated into ERT.
