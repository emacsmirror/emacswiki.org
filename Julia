Julia's ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and advice from a few years ago may no longer be current. As of October 2022, there seem to be two packages that support a Julia IDE for Emacs: ESS and ##julia-snail##.

There are a few lines of code that seem to be required in ##init.el## to get either ESS or ##julia-snail## to work with Julia. The following ##init.el## code was tested in Emacs 28.1 on Manjaro Linux 22.0.0; Julia version was 1.8.2.

=== ESS ===

Note this code depends on ##use-package##. I modified code found [https://sntag.github.io/post/2020-04-13-getting-emacs-and-julia-to-work/ here].

    (use-package ess
      :mode (
    	 ("\\.jl..'" . ess-mode)
    	 ("\\.R..'"  . ess-mode)
    	 ("\\.r..'"  . ess-mode)
    	 )
      )
    (add-hook 'julia-mode-hook #'ess-julia-mode)

=== julia-snail ===

The GitHub for julia-snail is [https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail here]. ##julia-snail## requires ##vterm##.

    (require 'julia-snail)
    (add-hook 'julia-mode-hook #'julia-snail-mode)
    ;; To add something like the C-<return> behavior from ESS
    (fset 'send-line-and-step-jl
          (kmacro-lambda-form [?\C-c ?\C-l ?\C-n] 0 "%d"))
    (add-hook 'julia-mode-hook
          (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-<return>") #'send-line-and-step-jl)))
