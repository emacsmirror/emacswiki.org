== Provide alternate stylesheets ==

I would like to choose the stylesheet for EmacsWiki easily.  If Emacswiki could provide alternate stylesheets---see  [http://orgmode.org/worg/ Worg]---then I will be able to choose the theme using View->Page Style->etc menu in Firefox. -- [[115.241.16.57]]

[new:DrewAdams:2012-08-05 16:41 UTC]
Does [[CSS]] correspond to your request?  I don't use alternative stylesheets myself, but last time I tried this (years ago) it seemed to do what you are suggesting. 

(I've updated HowTo to mention page [[CSS]].) -- DrewAdams

[new]

This is how the directives on [http://Orgmode.org/worg Worg] looks like:

    <link rel="stylesheet" title="Standard" href="/worg/style/worg.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Zenburn" href="/worg/style/worg-zenburn.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Classic" href="/worg/style/worg-classic.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://orgmode.org/css/lightbox.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />

This is how it looks like on EmacsWiki pages

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/emacs/wiki.css" />

Note the absence of "alternate stylesheet" attributes.  I am wondering whether such directives could be added to the site.

[new]
Given the selection we have on the [[CSS]] page, which are the themes you'd like to hard-code as alternatives? -- Alex

== Content Fixes ==

The emacs wiki content could use some refactoring and updating, especially if some snarky blog entries and reddit postings/comments are to be believed.  I can see 2 main ways to handle this: a top down approach (like Wikipedias "wiki projects") and a bottom up approach where wikizens can pick an individual page from a hit-list and work from there. To try and get this ball rolling, I have started up an EmacsWikiContent page. -- JonathanArkell

== Includes == 

One of the things about media wiki that is decent, is the ability to set up a different wiki page as a sub-page for includes.  This is especially helpful for marking certain pages as out-of-date, requiring refactoring, candidates for deletion, or wiki projects.  I don't think it has to be very complicated to start, just some simple way to include the text from one wikipage in another, and a way to list any pages that have that include.  (This is particularly handy for getting a list of pages that have out-of-date content).  Things like a separate namespace for templates, template variables, etc can come later. -- JonathanArkell

[new]
The mechanism to include pages is this:

{{{
<include "ExamplePage">
}}}

There is more to it, however. See Oddmuse:Transclusion.

The resulting HTML doesn't tell you that !ExamplePage has been transcluded, but if you're on !ExamplePage, clicking on the header will search for it. It's up to the users to use a decent prefix to identify pages that are to be transcluded and to mention the page name this piece of text is from. -- Alex

== Be Able To Specify Which Manual, for `Manual:' Links ==

I recently added a glossary entry for `macro'.  I added this link: Manual:macros.  Unfortunately, there is also a `macros' page in the CC mode manual, so this link sends you to a page where you need to pick from the two manuals.  The choice will not be obvious to a newbie.

It would be good to be able to somehow specify the manual: `(elisp)'. E.g. ##[[Manual (elisp):macros]]## or some such.  Being able to specify more than one manual would be a nice-to-have (without it one would just create multiple links). -- DrewAdams

[new]
I'm not sure how old this suggestion is. Right now I see that Manual:macros will link to a page that provides both links. Problem solved? -- Alex

== User Names on RecentChanges Page ==

It would be good if user names were treated normally at RecentChanges, that is, to show a non-existant page like a non-existant page is usually shown. People might be encouraged to follow it and create a home page.

[new]
I haven't thought about this in a long time. Maybe you're right. -- AlexSchroeder

== Layout ==

=== Edit Page ==

What about moving the "Please make sure..." text, plus the Username field above the text-input editing box? That would reduce the need to scroll the page by placing the Save and Preview buttons closer to the editing box (using Preview more than once while editing is common). In fact, it would be great if those two buttons could be on the same line as the "This change is a minor edit" check box, making them even closer to the edit box. -- DrewAdams

[new]
At the time I did this on purpose to make sure people read the blurb... :/

As for hitting Preview a lot: The access key should be P, so try M-p or C-p in your browser.

Other than that, if you have a CSS-based suggestion, we can try it out.
-- AlexSchroeder


=== Keys ===

[new]
Adding some style changes to break out &lt;code&gt; from the surrounding text would be very helpful for key strokes.  Especially if they are something like '<code>C-x (</code>' which is used for starting a keyboard macro. -- DocWhat

[new]
Do you mean in addition to using a monospaced font, something like a light gray background?
Alternatively, the weird accents-used-as-apostrophes such as `C-x C-c' usually work.
Unfortunately, the regular expression used prevents `C-x (' from working. :(

The particular regular expressions used, straight from the Perl code:

  if (/\G(\`|‘)([CM][- ][- A-Za-z0-9<>;:#]+)(\'|’)/cg
      or /\G(\`|‘)([-A-Za-z0-9\/\*]+[=]?)(\'|’)/cg) {
    return $q->code('&#x2018;' . $2 . '&#x2019;');
  }

Any suggestions for improvement? It would obviously be easy to style these occurrences.
But how?
-- AlexSchroeder

== Please write a summary ==

2007-08-12

* Without any comment at the summary the feed is absolute useless. Please consider writing a short but informative summary for your changes.

* I think it is quite helpful to know when an information was written. Every comment should have a date in front of.

* Most informations are useless for emacs beginners because the article is starting with a high assumption. Therefore there should be a standard layout for emacs modes like 1. what is it good for? 2. what i need to run it? 3. how could it get started? 4. which should be the minimum configuration? 5. everything else a geek have to know.

[new:AlexSchroeder:2007-08-12 08:19 UTC]
The situation is just the same on RecentChanges. I find that in terms of peer review, the author is usually more important than the summary; unknown authors have a higher chance of being checked by me. Unfortunately most feed readers do not support the RSS 2.0 WikiModule. Perhaps many people subscribe to the full feed including diff. That would be a good way to check out what has changed regardless of summary. If you're really desperate, you could try the [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rss;full=1;page=0;diff=1 RSS feed with diff but without page content]...

As for time stamps: Aren't we aiming for "timeless" information? At least as far as Emacs releases go. We will have people running Emacs 22 for a decade now, for all I know. Old information is not necessarily useless, so putting dates on ordinary pages can be misleading as well. The only time a time stamp makes sense is when you're putting personal thoughts on a page -- like this conversation, for example. But a wiki can be something between a FAQ and a manual, and neither has time stamps.

When it comes to page content, I guess you're right. We're somewhere between the FAQ (but there aren't many frequently asked questions), and an extension of the ElispManual. We're certainly not the manual itself.

== CSS (headers, printing) ==

[new]
For some ideas on print style sheets, see [http://alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/ Eric Meyer's article on A List Apart]. One particularly nice idea shows how to display the URL with hyperlinked text, which would be handy here.
--AmyYoung

[new]
What exactly should we do? -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Could we go back to the situation where in default CSS the rendering of different headers level differ only in the font size (but do differ) down until last HTML header level? -- JakubNarebski

[new]
Not unless more people support this since I don't like it. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
In graphical browsers second-level headers currently are the same size as regular text, just italic.  This does not standout at all, making them bold would be much better in my eyes.  For example I just added a page with a long list of code snippets at the end. I reorganized them thematically and then added second-level headers. Boy that was less readable as before! So I had to add the horizontal lines back that I previously removed.  Ps: why do we skip = and use == instead? -- JonasBernoulli

[new]
Take a look at the [[CSS]] page. That will allow you to use your own CSS instead of relying on the default. If you write a CSS file that makes a significant improvement and convince some other long-time users of the site, I'll be happy to use it instead of what we have right now.

As to the /why/ of the current CSS: I'm happy with the look of H2 and H3 headers. I believe HTML pages should have but one H1 element -- the one at the top of the page, and I believe any page on this wiki should be written with just H2 and H3 sections and subsections. I find the need for H4 subsubsections to be a sign that the text ought to be reorganized instead. I also find horizonzal lines unnecessary except when creating the pseudo-footers separating categories and related pages from the rest of the page. It's how I interpret the suggestions given by Robert Bringhurst in his _The Elements of Typographical Style_, p. 61ff. Typographically, poise is mad of white space. Don't permit the titles to oppress the text. Use as many levels of headings as you need: no more and no fewer. There were people who didn't like the amount of whitespace I prefer, which is why I'm using the theme "with more whitespace around headers and small-caps". -- AlexSchroeder

== Click the heading to search for pages in this category / that link here ==

This bothers me similarly to the above since it just adds clutter for anyone who knows what clicking on a header does.  I would like to remove this too but this would probably not be well received.  I would suggest that this information is somehow shown on all pages but in an less intrusive way.

Maybe somewhere in the footer close to where the language links are too.  Then again this link ("Pages linking here") as well as the links to the translations can easily be missed.  Maybe both kinds should be placed somewhere more visible?  But if you do this please do so in a way that makes it easy to hide it using a style sheet.  -- JonasBernoulli

== Subscription service to  watch changes == 

There should be a way to subscribe to changes to pages of interest to users, including Emacs Lisp files.

[new]
The current option is to subscribe to RSS feeds for each page or for pages matching a particular regular expression. The html has appropriate meta links. Alternatively you could go to RecentChanges, figure out what settings you need and change "action=rc" in the URL to "action=rss".

The URL for this page, for example, would be one of these:

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions## -- the default, listing the last major change in the last 7 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;days=30## -- listing the last major change in the last 30 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;showedit=1## -- listing the last change (major or minor) in the last 7 days

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;full=1## -- listing the last major change in the last 7 days with full page content (unless it's blows the arbitrary limit I've set in order to save bandwidth)

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=rss;rcidonly=EmacsWikiSuggestions;full=1;diff=1## -- listing the last major change in the last 7 days with full page content and diff

* ##http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/?action=rss;match=emacs## -- listing the last major change for any page matching the Perl regular expression "emacs" in the last 7 days

There are many more parameters to tune this.

Finally, if a few people were interested, we could add an _email subscription_ extension to the wiki. If you'd like to see this, edit this page and leave your name or send me an email <mailto:alex@emacswiki.org>.
