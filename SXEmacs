[http://www.sxemacs.org/ SXEmacs] is a fork from [[XEmacs]] 21.4, led by SteveYoungs, a former and current [[XEmacs]] developer. Relations between the two projects remain amicable, and most of the package system, for example, is maintained in common.  The last release was 22.1.17 in 2020 (see http://www.sxemacs.org/news.html).
