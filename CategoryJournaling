Many Emacs users keep an MeatBall:OnlineDiary, MeatBall:WebLog, or
something else along those lines, and many maintain it via one of
these funky Emacs tools.

This category lists EmacsLisp packages that help you maintain a weblog
or a similar website that gets updated frequently.

== Creating text files ==

* EmacsWikiJournal -- a journal support RSS and calendar; based on EmacsWikiMode.
* BlogMax -- http://billstclair.com/blogmax/
* RecordsMode -- lets you keep a diary and provides support for todo items.
* JournalMode -- keep a journal in Emacs; based on EmacsWikiMode
* [[Journal]] -- create text files using the date as the filename
* PlannerMode -- helps you plan your life by pulling together BBDB, calendar, Gnus, and EmacsMuse
* EmacsMuse -- Muse can integrate well with PyBlosxom with the help of the muse-blosxom.el file.
* OrgBlogging -- blogging with OrgMode
* Lisp:tjic-website.el -- a few small functions for managing local files
  that later need to get scp-ed or ftp-ed to a website
* Lisp:tjic-blog.el -- an add-on to tjic-website which supports a blog
  (weblog)
* [[lisplog]] -- Create and manage a blog with Emacs. It supports rss too
* [[Skinny]] -- an Elnode webapp for presenting a directory structure of [[Creole]] files as a blog
* OrgJournal -- a simple org-mode based journal mode that integrates with the calendar

Other packages that can be used with Emacs effortlessly, eg. because they
depend on plain text.

* [[http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/|Bloxsom]] is a web cgi that allows you to journal with normal flat files.  Each journal entry is a unique file. 

== Using an API ==

* [https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el mastodon.el] -- a client for Mastodon
* WebloggerMode -- for several blog APIs; Blogger, Metaweblog, Moveable Type, Live Journal, Wordpress
* wpmail.el <http://github.com/thomas11/wpmail/tree/master> -- for posting to Wordpress via e-mail. Currently only tested with wordpress.com.
* [[Tumblr]] -- implementation (currently only) for posting to Tumblr.
* BloggerMode -- for the Blogger API
* gblogger: [[http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/|Full-featured and up-to-date tools for the Google API]]. Part of the emacspeak suite, but available separately.
* <nowiki>LiveJournal</nowiki> clients (see MeatBall:LiveJournal)
** LjUpdate
** [[http://www.jwz.org/hacks/jwz-lj.el|jwz-lj.el]] 
* [[http://www.zerobeat.in/files/advogato.el|advogato.el]] 
* EmacsAtomApi -- an interface to weblog services which present the [[http://atomenabled.org|Atom API]].
* [[http://www.marginalia.org/code/mt.el|mt.el]] - Moveable Type (This package works well enough, but it only gives access to ''title'', ''description'' i.e. Body, and the categories. It would be nice to have: ''mt_allow_comments'', ''mt_allow_pings'', ''mt_text_more'', ''mt_excerpt'', ''mt_keywords'', ''mt_tb_ping_urls''. Looking over mt.el, it would seem that it's relatively easy to add these, but I'm not a Lisp programmer.)
* [[Identica-mode]] -- post to any laconi.ca server (similar to [[Twitter]] but free)
* [[Twitter]] -- post to twitter.com using various modes
* [[Eblog]] - provides an MUA-like interface for posting to Blogger using the new GData API.
* [[Tumbl]] -- Make posts to Tumblr from Emacs.
* [[http://github.com/snim2/posterous.el|Post to posterous.com from Emacs]]

* GnusRss -- read RSS feeds in Gnus
* [[Elfeed]] -- RSS and Atom feed reader inspired by notmuch
* WThreeMShimbun -- read various web articles in Gnus, Wanderlust, or Mew.
* HOWTOReadFeedsInEmacsViaEmail

== Discussion ==

* EevMode -- e-script lets you keep an EXECUTABLE diary! VERY COOL!

/While I have no doubt whatsoever, that one can implement a diary within the e-script environment, using eev-mode or not, I feel inclined to state that neither on the EevMode page of this wiki, nor on the eev-mode or e-script project homepage there is anything written about such subject.  The same way one could add a link here to a perl script reposatory, saying there is a way to create a diary with perl somehow./  --QirbCameled

Writing diary in e-script enables us to replay operations.
I think it is VERY IMPORTANT to take a note of commands when you learn computers.
eev-mode is only a minor-mode to execute shell commands in Emacs, so it is orthogonal with other major-modes for journal. -- [[Anonymous]]

[new]
It seems to me that there are many such commands, potentially useful for many tasks, including keeping a journal.  To list them all on this page would diminish the value of this category, however. -- AlexSchroeder

Nathan Weizenbaum wrote a nice [http://nex3.leeweiz.net/posts/25-how-i-wrote-an-emacs-blog-client-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale blog post] about the experience of hacking up hacking up an Emacs client for his blog with TextileMode and HttpPost. -- EdwardOConnor

* Organize and clean up the page ?

This page is really getting messy mixing real CategoryJournaling tools
with CategoryChatClient or other tools. It is time to take a decision
and leave here qualified tool. Opinions ? -- XavierMaillard
