Google Android is a mobile phone operating system based loosely on Linux with a custom Java stack.

In the context of Emacs you are probally interested in either developing applications within Emacs or possibly running EmacsOnAndroid.

For development there are currently only a few approaches:

* EmDroid
* RemVee's [https://codeberg.org/rwv/android-mode/raw/branch/master/android-mode.el android-mode]
* CEDET (CollectionOfEmacsDevelopmentEnvironmentTools) depends on android-mode.el, and is integrated with EDE supporting project creation, debugging, and uploading to your device.  It will configure your Java buffers to perform symbol lookups in android.jar, providing full smart completion support.

<b>Help!</b> When I invoked the command <code>android-ant-install</code>, I got the following error message, anyone has seen that, but there is no problem when I invoke ant in the console:

<pre>
-dex:
     [echo] Converting compiled files and external libraries into /home/justin/projects/android-projects/test/bin/classes.dex...
     [echo]          
    [apply]

    [apply] ...while processing com/test/R.class
    [apply] 
            ...
    [apply] no classfiles specified

BUILD FAILED

<b>Solution:</b> add the $JAVA_HOME/bin to the path environment variable
