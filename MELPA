[https://melpa.org/ MELPA] is an [[ELPA]]-compatible package repository that contains an enormous amount of useful Emacs packages.

In contrast to ELPA, Emacs is not configured by default to install packages from MELPA. You will have to configure Emacs to use it.

= Get started =

To add MELPA to your ##package-archives##, put this in your init file:

{{{
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
}}}

If you prefer versions that have been tagged by their maintainers for release, you can use this instead:

{{{
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
}}}

Next, you can use `M-x package-list-packages' and install new things to your hearts content.

For more information, see [https://melpa.org/#/getting-started Getting started with MELPA].

= MELPA Stable =

For builds of stable version packages triggered by upstream version tags, see [[https://stable.melpa.org/ MELPA Stable]].

= Adding your package =

MELPA uses a recipe system similar to Homebrew or [[el-get]].  Recipes are stored in a github repository which tells the updated package.el how to download each package.

The collaboration model for MELPA is like that of the Homebrew package manager on OS X.  Package authors do not need to upload new versions of their packages to MELPA, since they are built automatically.  To add new recipes, simply file a pull request [https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa on Github].  Currently supported backends are git, svn, bzr, hg, and darcs.

= History =

* MELPA used to support packages directly from this wiki, but [https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/5008 no longer does] due to security concerns.
* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7vocqa/update_on_melpa_removing_emacswiki_packages_they/dtuhzmt/|Reddit post]] by DrewAdams about those security concerns and his libraries on %%EmacsWiki%%.
