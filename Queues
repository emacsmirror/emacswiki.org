A queue can be used as both a first-in last-out and a first-in first-out stack, i.e. elements can be added to and removed from either end of the queue. This package is an updated and rewritten version of the Emacs Lisp Library (Elib) queue library.

The latest version  (0.1, released February 2009) can be obtained from:

* Queue package download: http://www.dr-qubit.org/download.php?file=predictive/queue.el
* Queue git repository: <code>http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git</code>
* Web site: http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#structures

The development version is hosted in the same git repository as PredictiveMode. Note that the git repository URL is a git repository, ''*not*'' a web-site. You cannot view it in a web browser. To grab the latest development version, clone the repository using:

  git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/predictive.git


The original Elib version can be obtained from:

* JDEE web site: http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.tar.gz

Please send bug reports and suggestions to [mailto:toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org] (you can post them here as well if you like, of course). I don't check this page regularly, so anything not emailed to me is likely to languish here unnoticed for some time.

Enjoy!
