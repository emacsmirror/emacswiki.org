== Purpose of this page? ==

Sorry for the rude sounding question, just didn't know how else to put it.

The (current) Eshell Manual is linked on the CategoryEshell page, but this page is linked from the "About Eshell" section on that same page, and it's not clear what this page is for.

From what I can gather, it used to be difficult to find the texinfo for eshell?

In any case, the title of the page seems misleading in 2025. I was hesitant to just delete everything because there seems to be some history here I didn't want to trample on if we'd like to preserve the commentary, at least (if not the dead links).

There's another page - EshellTexi - which is also related to the 1st edition (c. 2000) eshell manual and contains the source for it. 

For now, I'll just update the Category page to make it clearer what these two pages are, but if anyone has any thoughts about what (if anything) would improve this page, I'd be glad to hear them!

At the beginning, Eshell had no manual at all. Once the manual exists, pages such as this are superfluous and should be deleted, I think.

I don’t think we need to preserve the page history – it can be found in git, if you really want.
