== Hey, I'm Andy ==
(also known as [::DrOps])


I live in Germany. in a village somewhere between Münster, Osnabrück, and Bielefeld. I tinker with tech, mess around with plain text, and try to automate myself out of work (hasn’t worked yet, but hope dies last).

By day, I’m usually coding, scripting, or wrestling my Fish shell into submission. By night, I dream up solarpunk futures and fictional characters who regularly ignore my outline and threaten me with oversized wrenches.

I have an irrational love for **plain text**. Give me `Org-mode`, `ledger`, `denote`, or even a good ol’ `.txt` file, and I’m happy. No fancy GUIs, no vendor lock-in — just clean, portable, future-proof chaos. If I can grep it, I can live with it.

You’ll usually find me deep in a project rabbit hole, organizing life with a tiling window manager and too many buffers open. Occasionally I remember to eat.
