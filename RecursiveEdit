'''Recursive edit''' helps when you want to break out of the current command that you're currently doing and temporarily pursue something else, with the ability to snap back to where you were before.

# For example, when replacing some text with `##M-%##' or `##M-C-%##' you can replace and edit the matches with `C-w' or just edit with `C-r' to touch up some of the entries you are replacing along the way when they are a special case.  When you're done you punch `C-M-c' and you snap back into `query-replace' or `query-replace-regexp'.  You can even change buffers or visit other files -- almost anything.

# While saving buffers with `C-x s', type `C-r' to view the current file in ViewMode.

# While querying with `C-x q' in a keyboard macro, `C-r' enters a recursive edit.

# <code>(setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)</code> allows to use for example `C-u M-!' within the minibuffer,
<code>( minibuffer-depth-indicate-mode t)</code> is advisable when former variable is set, because here the recursion depth is not indicated by brackets in the mode line.

The EmacsManual says:

: ''It is possible to be in recursive edits within recursive edits.  For
example, after typing `C-r' in a `query-replace', you may type a
command that enters the debugger.  This begins a recursive editing level
for the debugger, within the recursive editing level for `C-r'.  Mode
lines display a pair of square brackets for each recursive editing
level currently in progress.''

When are you in recursive edit?:

: ''The mode line shows you when you are in a recursive edit by
displaying square brackets around the parentheses that always surround
the major and minor mode names.  Every window's mode line shows this in
the same way, since being in a recursive edit is true of Emacs as a
whole rather than any particular window or buffer.''

On exiting:

: ''"Exiting" the recursive edit means returning to the unfinished
command, which continues execution.  The command to exit is `C-M-c'
(`exit-recursive-edit').''

: ''You can also "abort" the recursive edit.  This is like exiting, but
also quits the unfinished command immediately.  Use the command `C-]'
(`abort-recursive-edit') to do this.''


And the most important thing it says for EmacsLisp programmers:

: ''In general, we try to minimize the use of recursive editing levels in
GNU Emacs.  This is because they constrain you to "go back" in a
particular order--from the innermost level toward the top level.  When
possible, we present different activities in separate buffers so that
you can switch between them as you please.  Some commands switch to a
new major mode which provides a command to switch back.  These
approaches give you more flexibility to go back to unfinished tasks in
the order you choose.''

Similarly, the ElispManual says this:

: ''Most applications should not use recursive editing, except as part of
using the minibuffer.  Usually it is more convenient for the user if you
change the major mode of the current buffer temporarily to a special
major mode, which should have a command to go back to the previous mode.
(The `e' command in Rmail uses this technique.)  Or, if you wish to
give the user different text to edit "recursively," create and select a
new buffer in a special mode.  In this mode, define a command to
complete the processing and go back to the previous buffer.  (The `m'
command in Rmail does this.)''
