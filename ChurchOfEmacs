 Organization: The Church of Emacs

Many emacs hackers maintain weird pages out there that refer to the
Church of Emacs.  Some have it in in their "Organization" header when
they post to EmacsNewsgroups.  Others wrote code to produce Emacs
related religious texts based on existing religious texts.  Here are
some links:

* RichardStallman has a page on St IGNUcius: http://www.stallman.org/saint.html (including a picture! ^_^)
* DeepakGoel has written faith.el (Helps reinforce and spread faith in the ONE TRUE EDITOR) http://www.gnufans.net/~deego/emacspub/lisp-mine/faith/

** You can spread that faith with erc!

       (defun erc-cmd-FAITH (&rest ignore)
          "Post faith in the current channel." 
          (interactive)
          (require 'faith)
          (erc-send-message
          (mapconcat 'identity (split-string (faith-quote) "\n") " ")))


During a discussion with Saint IGNUcius in Zarautz, Spain, we discovered that the saint key of the church of Emacs is META, and no other.

* TerrenceBrannon is impressed with the hymn OnwardEmacsCoders
and has written "The Book of Emacs" -

He also is not sure why this is considered in the category humor.
