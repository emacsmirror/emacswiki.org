EdiffMode is great. It needs a couple of diff-tools to work though. You have at least these options to get them:

* Install CygWin
* Fetch some nice natively compiled Unix command ports, found here: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ (this is really really handy if you do not want the full CygWin package and still miss some of the nice Unix commands). *This is not maintained any more*.
* You can also diff28b.zip from ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/.
* Use <nowiki>GnuWin32</nowiki> tools that can be found on http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/. These seems to be more actively maintained than the <nowiki>UnxUtils</nowiki>. See also the documentation for [[EmacsW32]] where I try to mention positive and negative sides of the different alternatives mentioned here.
* [[EmacsW32]] comes with gnuwin32 utils (see above) and ediff works right out of the box.

If you use CygWin way all should work nicely after installing CygWin (I think it adds itself to the path, otherwise you have to do that manually).

I use these libraries with CygWin. You might find them useful too.

* Lisp:cygwin-mount.el
* Lisp:setup-cygwin.el

If you get the natively compiled tools from Sourceforge or Simtel, put the diff-tools (diff.exe, diff3.exe and cmp.exe) in a directory on your PATH. On Win2000 or <nowiki>WinXP</nowiki>, you can edit the PATH by going to Control Panel-->System-->Advanced-->Environment Variables.

Ediff away!

I wanted to use ediff as my diff tool in Perforce, but Perforce requires an executable to call, and "bash my-shell-script-hack.sh" didn't work.  I wrote this short hack, which works for me (compiled with gcc / cygwin) when it and gnuclientw are in my path.

<pre>

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* 
 * call-ediff is used to call ediff from Perforce.  
 * gcc -o call-ediff call-ediff.c && call-ediff y:/Source/find_audio_xmls.sh y:/Source/find_audio_xmls.sh~
 */

void hackPathSeparator(char *windozePath) {
    char *c;

    for (c = windozePath; *c; c++) {
	if ('\\' == *c)
	    *c = '/';
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]) {
    char *param1 = argv[1];
    char *param2 = argv[2];

    /* We get \ part separators from Perforce; hack these to / */

    hackPathSeparator(param1);
    hackPathSeparator(param2);

    /* hack the arg list (ugh) */

    argv[1] = "-e";
    /* Sample usage: argv[2] = "(progn (message \"foo\") (raise-frame))"; */

    char *command = (char *)malloc(4096);
    sprintf(command, "(progn (raise-frame) (ediff \"%s\" \"%s\"))", param1, param2);

    argv[2] = command;

    execvp("gnuclientw.exe", argv);
    return 0;
}

</pre>

----
I've found that if you compile with these arguments you can avoid the console window:
<tt>
  gcc -Wl,--subsystem,windows -o call-ediff call-ediff.c
</tt>
