== Customization and General Tips ==

This page contains some tips on using '''Icicles''' and descriptions
of '''Icicles''' [[user option]]s. 

'''See Also:'''

* [[Icicles - File-Name Completion Tips]] for tips on using '''Icicles''' to complete file names.  User options related to file-name and directory-name [[completion]] are presented there, not here.

* [[Icicles - Large Candidate Sets]] for tips on improving performance when dealing with a large number of completion candidates.

* [[Icicles - Customizing Key Bindings]] for information on customizing '''Icicles''' [[key binding]]s.




=== Using Icicles with Delete Selection Mode ===

'''Icicles''' works especially well with '''DeleteSelectionMode''', which I
use and recommend.  (Likewise, for PC selection mode, which uses
Delete Selection mode.)  In ''Delete Selection'' mode, whenever the [[region]]
(selection) is active (highlighted), you can simply type to
replace text in the region, or hit `DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d'
(Delete) to delete the
region.

However, library '''<tt>[[delsel.el]]</tt>''', which provides ''Delete Selection''
mode, binds [[key sequence]]s in [[minibuffer]] maps that are also bound by
'''Icicles'''.  For this reason, if you use both '''Icicles''' and ''Delete
Selection'' mode, you must turn on ''Icicle'' mode ''after'' you turn on
''Delete Selection'' mode.  If you forget to do this, you will notice
that `C-g' does not abort minibuffer input.  The remedy is simply
to turn ''Icicle'' mode off, then on again.








=== Icicles User Options and Faces ===

There are many user options (user [[variable]]s) and several [[face]]s that '''Icicles''' defines, and you can also
use various standard Emacs user options, including IcompleteMode options,
that control various aspects of completion.

Here is a screenshot from `list-faces-display' that shows all of the '''Icicles''' faces, with their default appearances for a light background. Each of these faces is described below.

[[image:DrewsEmacsIciclesFaces]]

Here are screenshots of the '''Icicles''' and '''Customize''' submenus of the Emacs '''Options''' menu.  Most of the items in the '''Icicles''' submenu let you modify specific '''Icicles''' options, which are described below. Those in the '''Customize''' submenu are '''Icicles''' operations for customizing anything -- they are indicated by the prefix '''[Icy]'''. 

[[image:DrewsEmacsIciclesOptionsMenu]]


[[image:DrewsEmacsIciclesOptionsCustomizeMenu]]







One thing that can be important to understand is that if you
customize an option, and if the default value of that option
changes later in a more recent Icicles version, then your
customization will preclude your taking advantage of any new
features represented by that default option value.

This is important particularly for complex options such as
'''`<tt>[[#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>''''.  Taking that option as an
example, if '''Icicles''' later adds more commands with default key
bindings then you will not see those bindings if you have a
customized value of `icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  There is
nothing wrong with that; I just want you to be aware of it.

In general, it can be a good idea to look at the latest change-log
entry for ##icicles-opt.el## in <tt>[[icicles-chg.el]]</tt>, to see what changes
have been made.  If you then want to take advantage of some
change, you can use `M-x customize-option' and visually compare
your customized value with the new default value in
<tt>[[icicles-opt.el]]</tt>, then edit your customized value as you like.







----
[:icicle-mode-hook]
==== Option icicle-mode-hook ====

User option '''`icicle-mode-hook'''' is a normal hook containing functions that are run after entering and exiting ''Icicle'' mode. This is `nil', by default.

----
[:icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook]
==== Option icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook ====

User option '''`icicle-minibuffer-setup-hook'''' is a [[list]] of
functions to be run at the end of minibuffer setup for ''Icicle''
mode.  This is `nil', by default.

----
[:icicle-update-input-hook]
==== Option icicle-update-input-hook ====

User option '''`icicle-update-input-hook'''' is a list of functions to
be run when minibuffer input is updated (typing or deleting).
This is `nil', by default.


----
[:icicle-no-match-hook]
==== Option icicle-no-match-hook ====

User option '''`icicle-no-match-hook'''' is a list of functions to be
run during completion (`TAB' or `S-TAB') when there are no
completion candidates that match the current input.  This is `nil', by default.

----
[:CaseSensitivity]
[:completion-ignore-case]
[:read-file-name-completion-ignore-case]
[:read-buffer-completion-ignore-case]
[:case-fold-search]
==== Case Sensitivity - Options completion-ignore-case, read-file-name-completion-ignore-case, read-buffer-completion-ignore-case, case-fold-search ====

The following standard user options control
whether completion distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase
letters:

* '''`completion-ignore-case''''
* '''`read-file-name-completion-ignore-case'''' (Emacs 22 and
later)
* '''`read-buffer-completion-ignore-case'''' (Emacs 23 and
later)

In addition, you can ''toggle'' case-sensitivity at any time using
'''`C-A'''' (that is, '''`C-S-a'''') in the minibuffer.  This toggles '''`case-fold-search'''' and `completion-ignore-case'.  With a [[prefix argument]], it also toggles `read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' and `read-buffer-completion-ignore-case'.

More precisely, it toggles the default value of `case-fold-search', and then it sets the other variables to the value of
`case-fold-search'.  Because the ''default value'' of
`case-fold-search' is changed, ''all [[buffer]]s are affected''.
Note that because some '''Icicles''' [[command]]s bind one or more of these
variables, toggling case-sensitivity during command execution will not
necessarily toggle their global values.

You can tell whether completion is currently case-sensitive by
looking at the ''Icicle'' [[minor mode]] lighter in the [[mode line]], if
`icicle-highlight-lighter-flag' is non-`nil'.  If case-sensitive,
then the lighter text (with or without the [[multi-command]] suffix `##+##' and the [[multi-completion]] suffix `##||##')
is '''`Icy''''; if not, it is '''`ICY''''.

[:completion-ignored-extensions]
==== Option completion-ignored-extensions ====

See [[Icicles - File-Name Completion Tips#completion-ignored-extensions|Icicles - File-Name Completion Tips]]

----
[:icicle-point-position-in-candidate][:icicle-mark-position-in-candidate]
[:icicle-change-region-background-flag][:icicle-region-background]
==== Options icicle-region-background, icicle-point-position-in-candidate, icicle-mark-position-in-candidate, icicle-change-region-background-flag ====

User options `icicle-region-background', `icicle-point-position-in-candidate',
`icicle-mark-position-in-candidate', and
`icicle-change-region-background-flag' are all used to ''define the [[region]]'' (the
selected text) when ''[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]'' completion candidates.  They are described below individually. The region is
active when cycling, so you can easily delete it or replace it.

User option '''`icicle-point-position-in-candidate'''' defines the minibuffer
''[[cursor]]'' position ([[point]]) while cycling candidate completions.  By default,
the cursor is placed at the end of the root being completed.  You
can instead place it at the root beginning or at the beginning or
end of the complete minibuffer input.  For file-name input, the
beginning of minibuffer input starts after the directory name (which is
inserted automatically).

Similarly, user option '''`icicle-mark-position-in-candidate'''' defines the
position of the ''[[mark]]''; by default, it is at the end of the input.
Together, these two options control the size and placement of the
region in a flexible way.  You can make the region include all of
the input, only the root, from beginning to root, or from root to
end.  You can put the cursor at either end of the region.  You can
get rid of the region altogether, by making point and mark
coincide (at any of the possible positions).

These screenshots show two of the sixteen possible position combinations of `icicle-point-position-in-candidate' and `icicle-mark-position-in-candidate'.  The first shows the default behavior: 

* Point at the end of the root, in this case `nibuf'. The '''root''' is your input before completion, but possibly expanded, if `<tt>[[#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt>' is non-`nil'
* Mark at the end of the input (completion candidate). 

The second shows point at the start of the input and mark at the end of the input. The position of point is indicated by the bar cursor; the position of mark is the other end of the cyan-colored region.

[[image:IciclesMinibufRegion1]]
[[image:IciclesMinibufRegion2]]

Because the region background color is often quite different from the
[[frame]] background color (in order to have it stand out), it can be a bit
hard to read the completion candidates when the region is
highlighted during input [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]].  If user option
'''`icicle-change-region-background-flag'''' is non-`nil', however, then
the ''region background'' is changed to a color that differs only
slightly from the frame background, making it easier to read the
completion candidates (see screenshots, above).  The actual background color used is the value of 
'''`icicle-region-background'''', which you can customize.  If you make
this color the same as the frame background, then the region
background is, in effect, invisible.

The default value of `icicle-change-region-background-flag' is
determined by the current value of `delete-selection-mode', that
is, whether or not '''DeleteSelectionMode''' is enabled, when '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' is loaded.  For this
reason, if you use Delete Selection mode and you want the region
background to change in the minibuffer, you should either turn on
Delete Selection mode ''before'' loading '''<tt>[[icicles.el]]</tt>''' or explicitly
customize `icicle-change-region-background-flag' to non-`nil'.

----
[:icicle-default-value]
==== Option icicle-default-value ====

User option '''`icicle-default-value'''' controls the treatment of a
default value for minibuffer input.  When the value is non-`nil'
and the ##INITIAL-INPUT## argument of minibuffer-reading functions is `nil' or ##""##, the ##DEFAULT-VALUE## argument can be inserted into the minibuffer as the initial input.  

For `completing-read' and `read-file-name', if the option value is `t' then the default value is normally added the prompt as a hint.
However, for `read-file-name', if option `insert-default-directory' is
non-`nil', then to avoid duplication:

* If the default value is the same as the value of `default-directory' then it is not added to the prompt.

* If the default value is added to the prompt then it is first made
relative to `default-directory'.

Adding the default value to the prompt corresponds to the more
or less conventional behavior of vanilla Emacs.  But vanilla
Emacs does not do this systematically for `completing-read' (or
for any of the input-reading functions).  Instead, it hard-codes
default values into prompts in the commands that call these
functions.

By design, '''Icicles''' commands never add the default value to the
prompt themselves.  This includes '''Icicles''' versions of standard
commands that might do so.  '''Icicles''' instead tries to give you
the choice, using option `icicle-default-value'.

Function
`completing-read' is the only input-reading function for which
'''Icicles''' adds the default value to the prompt (for
`icicle-default-value' value `t').  Other such functions, like
`(##icicle-##)##read-from-minibuffer##' and `(##icicle-##)##read-file-name##',
treat empty input (just `RET') specially --- see their doc for
details.

Non-`nil' and non-`t' means to automatically insert the
default input value into the minibuffer as the initial value.  I prefer to have it inserted, as I often use the default value (perhaps editing it).  
A value of `nil' neither inserts the default value nor adds it to the prompt.


If the value is `t' or `nil', remember that you can always
insert the default value manually using `M-n'.  If the value is neither `t'
nor `nil', you can always use `M-p' to remove the default value from the minibuffer.


If you often want to use or edit the default value, then
consider setting `icicle-default-value' to non-`nil' and
non-`t'.  If you rarely do so, then consider setting it to `nil'
or `t'.

A non-`nil', non-`t' value of `icicle-default-value' controls also
whether or not the initial value is ''preselected'' and where to leave the ''cursor'': at the beginning or end
of the value.

Preselecting the value can be useful in DeleteSelectionMode or PC Selection mode, because it makes it easy to
replace that value by typing characters, or delete it by hitting
`DEL' (Backspace) or `C-d' (Delete).  However, ''all'' of the
initial input is ''lost'' if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL', which
is inconvenient if you want to edit it only slightly. See [[Icicles - Inserting Text from Cursor]].


----
[:icicle-default-in-prompt-format-function]
==== Option icicle-default-in-prompt-format-function ====

If you use `t' as the value of `icicle-default-value' then you
can use option '''`icicle-default-in-prompt-format-function'''' to
format the text that shows the (first) default value in the
prompt.  The option value is a function that accepts the
default value (a string) and returns a string that is prepended
to the first occurrence of "##: ##" in the prompt.  This option has
no effect unless `icicle-default-value' is `t'.


----
[:icicle-thing-at-point-functions]
[:icicle-default-thing-insertion]
==== Options icicle-thing-at-point-functions, icicle-default-thing-insertion ====

User options '''`icicle-thing-at-point-functions'''' and '''`icicle-default-thing-insertion'''' control the behavior of '''`##M-.##'''' in the minibuffer, which grabs text from the current buffer and yanks it into the minibuffer. See [[Icicles - Inserting Text from Cursor]] and the [[doc string]] (`C-h v') of `icicle-thing-at-point-functions' for more information.

----
[:icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements]
==== Option icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements ====

User option '''`icicle-comint-dynamic-complete-replacements''''
specifies a list of function replacements for
`icicle-comint-dynamic-complete' to replace the functions in
`comint-dynamic-complete-functions'.  You can use this to
provide '''Icicles''' completion for various modes that inherit from
ComintMode.  By default, it treats Comint mode and ShellMode.


----
[:icicle-input-string]
==== Option icicle-input-string ====

User option '''`icicle-input-string'''' is a [[regexp]] string that is
inserted in the minibuffer when you use '''`C-=''''.  See 
[[Icicles - Inserting a Regexp from a Variable or Register]].


----
[:icicle-historical-candidate-other]
[:icicle-Info-visited-max-candidates]
==== Option icicle-Info-visited-max-candidates, Face icicle-historical-candidate-other ====

In buffer `*Completions*' during completion for [[multi-command]]
`icicle-Info-index' (`i' in InfoMode), face
'''`icicle-historical-candidate-other'''' is used to highlight index
topics that refer to Info nodes that you have already visited.
This highlighting is controlled by user option
'''`icicle-Info-visited-max-candidates'''' as well as option
`icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag'.
See [[Icicles - Info Enhancements#HighlightTopicsForVisitedNodes|Highlighting Index Topics for Visited Info Nodes]].



----
[:icicle-historical-candidate]
[:icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag]
==== Option icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag, Face icicle-historical-candidate ====

In buffer `*Completions*', face '''`icicle-historical-candidate'''' is used to highlight
completion candidates that you have used (entered with `RET')
previously.  This highlighting is controlled by user option
'''`icicle-highlight-historical-candidates-flag''''.  You can ''toggle''
this option from the minibuffer at any time using '''`C-pause''''.
See [[Icicles - History Enhancements]].





----
[:icicle-saved-candidate]
[:icicle-highlight-saved-candidates-flag]
==== Option icicle-highlight-saved-candidates-flag, Face icicle-saved-candidate ====

In buffer `*Completions*', face '''`icicle-saved-candidate'''' is used
to highlight completion candidates that you have saved (e.g.,
using `##C-M->##').  This highlighting is controlled by user option
'''`icicle-highlight-saved-candidates-flag''''.  You can ''toggle'' this
option from the minibuffer at any time using '''`S-pause''''.
See [[Icicles - Candidate Sets#SavingAndRetrieving|Saving and Retrieving Completion Candidates]].

==== Faces icicle-current-candidate-highlight, icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions, icicle-annotation, icicle-match-highlight-Completions, icicle-match-highlight-minibuffer, icicle-complete-input  ====

In buffer `*Completions*', face '''`icicle-current-candidate-highlight'''' highlights the current
completion candidate, face '''`icicle-common-match-highlight-Completions'''' highlights the [[Icicles - Expanded-Common-Match Completion|expanded common match]] among all completions, and face '''`icicle-annotation'''' is used for candidate annotations.  Faces '''`icicle-match-highlight-Completions''''  and '''`icicle-match-highlight-minibuffer'''' 
highlight whatever your input matches, in buffer `*Completions*' and in the minibuffer, respectively.  In the minibuffer, face '''`icicle-complete-input'''' highlights your input when it is complete.  You can customize these, as well as the other '''Icicles''' faces.



----
[:icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag]
==== Option icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-touche-pas-aux-menus-flag'''' means
that '''Icicles''' will not add menu items to [[menu bar]] menus, except
for the '''Icicles''' and '''Minibuf''' menus.  Default value `nil' means
that whenever a relevant menu already exists, '''Icicles''' items
are added to it (when in ''Icicle'' mode).  Put differently,
non-`nil' means consolidate all '''Icicles''' menu items in a single
'''Icicles''' menu.


For example, if `nil' then item '''Delete File''' is
added to the '''File''' menu; otherwise it is added to the '''Icicles'''
menu.


The value of this option is used only when ''Icicle'' mode is initially
established, so changing it has no effect after '''Icicles''' has
been loaded.  However, you can change it and save the new value,
so that it will be used next time. See [[Icicles - Nutshell View#Menus|Icicles - Menus]] for more about the '''Icicles''' and '''Minibuf''' menus.


----
[:icicle-functions-to-redefine]
==== Option icicle-functions-to-redefine ====

User option '''`icicle-functions-to-redefine'''' controls
whether '''Icicles''' redefines some standard functions, enhancing them
to use '''Icicles''' completion.  You can specify which functions to
redefine.  The original function definitions are restored when
you exit ''Icicle'' mode.


----
[:icicle-inhibit-advice-functions]
==== Option icicle-inhibit-advice-functions ====

Option '''`icicle-inhibit-advice-functions'''' is a list of functions
that '''Icicles''' redefines, and for which ''Icicle'' mode deactivates
the advice.  The advice for each is reactivated when you leave
''Icicle'' mode.  Generally, it is a bad idea to use advice with
functions that '''Icicles''' redefines, in particular minibuffer
functions.  If you want to allow some such advice or prohibit
advice for additional functions, then customize this list.

Note: If you or a library you load advises one of these
functions while you are in ''Icicle'' mode, then toggle ''Icicle'' mode
twice, so that this option can have the proper effect.




----
[:icicle-widgets-to-redefine]
==== Option icicle-widgets-to-redefine ====

Option '''`icicle-widgets-to-redefine'''' is a list of widgets that
'''Icicles''' redefines for Icicle mode.  Widgets are Emacs objects
used, in particular, by Customize.  The default value is
`(color file)', meaning that the `color' and `file' widgets are redefined.  They are redefined to allow '''Icicles''' completion on color and file-name fields.

With these redefinitions, when you edit a color or file-name field in
[[Customize]] (in ''Icicle'' mode) `M-TAB' performs '''Icicles''' completion.
Initially, [[prefix completion]] is used, but you can then use
[[apropos completion]], [[progressive completion]], and so on.

For file-name completion, the portion of the file name before [[point]] in the editing field
is completed.  By default, the rest of the field content, past
point, is not deleted.  If you use a [[prefix argument]] (i.e., `C-u M-TAB') then the rest of the line is deleted.

For color completion, a [[prefix argument]] means to use the RGB
value of the color, not its name, as the option value.

For color completion, if `<tt>[[#icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag|icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag]]</tt>' is
non-`nil' then completion is WYSIWYG.  You can complete against
the color name or its RGB value, or you can enter an RGB value
with no name without completing.  See function 
`icicle-widget-color-complete' for more information.

[:icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-delay]
[:icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag]
==== Options icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-delay, icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag'''' means that
whenever there is only one completion candidate that matches
your input, that candidate is used immediately, without
requiring you to hit `RET' or `S-RET'.

When `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag' is non-`nil', option
'''`icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-delay'''' is the number of
seconds '''Icicles''' waits, before returning to top level with the
sole completion.  (It has no effect if the flag is `nil'.)  The
delay gives you a chance to forestall acceptance of the sole
completion: editing the completion (typing or deleting a
character) before the delay expires prevents its automatic
acceptance.  The default value is 0 seconds (no delay).





----
[:icicle-top-level-key-bindings]
==== Option icicle-top-level-key-bindings ====

User option '''`icicle-top-level-key-bindings'''' specifies
top-level commands and their bindings for ''Icicle'' mode.
By default, this rebinds several standard Emacs [[key]]s (in ''Icicle''
mode only).  For example, it substitutes `icicle-kill-buffer'
for `kill-buffer' (binding it to whatever `kill-buffer' is bound
to globally).  Top-level commands are commands that are not used
only in the minibuffer.  To change these bindings, customize
`icicle-top-level-key-bindings'.  If you do that, then
you must exit and re-enter ''Icicle'' mode to ensure that the change takes
effect.  This is really necessary only if your changes would
''un''define a key.





----
[:icicle-minibuffer-key-bindings]
==== Option icicle-minibuffer-key-bindings ====

User option '''`icicle-minibuffer-key-bindings'''' specifies bindings
for keys available during minibuffer input in ''Icicle'' mode.
These bindings are in effect whether or not [[completion]] is
available.  This does not include keys concerned with
completion, cycling, and help, which are covered by other user
options.  The value has the same form as for option
'''`<tt>[[#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>''''.




----
[:icicle-completion-key-bindings]
==== Option icicle-completion-key-bindings ====

User option '''`icicle-completion-key-bindings'''' specifies keys to
bind to various '''Icicles''' minibuffer commands that are used during
completion.  These are generally not commands that complete your
minibuffer input, but commands that you use to edit that input
or act on it in different ways.  This option value has the same
form as for option '''`<tt>[[#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>''''.






----
[:icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings]
==== Option icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings ====

User option '''`icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings'''' specifies
bindings for additional keys available during [[completion]] of
[[buffer]]-name candidates.  The default value of the option
provides keys that filter (narrow) the set of available
candidates.




----
[:icicle-completion-list-key-bindings]
==== Option icicle-completion-list-key-bindings ====

User option '''`icicle-completion-list-key-bindings'''' specifies key
bindings for buffer `*Completions*'.  The value has the same
form as for option '''`<tt>[[#icicle-top-level-key-bindings|icicle-top-level-key-bindings]]</tt>''''.




----
[:icicle-candidate-help-keys]
==== Option icicle-candidate-help-keys ====

User option '''`icicle-candidate-help-keys'''' specifies the keys that
display help about the current completion candidate.  The
default values are '''`C-M-RET'''' (`C-M-return'), '''`C-M-help'''',
'''`C-M-f1'''', '''`C-help'''', and '''`C-f1''''.


----
[:icicle-candidate-action-keys]

[:icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys]
==== Options icicle-modal-cycle-(down|up)(-help|(-alt)-action)-keys ====

The following user options specify the keys to use for [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]
candidates according to the current completion mode.  The
default bindings are in parentheses.

* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-down-keys'''' (`down')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys'''' (`up')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-down-action-keys'''' (`C-down')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-up-action-keys'''' (`C-up')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-down-alt-action-keys'''' (`C-S-down')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-up-alt-action-keys'''' (`C-S-up')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-down-help-keys'''' (`C-M-down')
* '''`icicle-modal-cycle-up-help-keys'''' (`C-M-up')

The completion mode, and hence the behavior of these keys, is
changed only when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' during completion: the
mode is [[prefix completion]] after `TAB' and [[apropos completion]]
after `S-TAB'.

Note: If your customizations of the modal and non-modal cycling
keys conflict, the non-modal values win.  For example, if you
define both `icicle-modal-cycle-up-keys' and
`icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-keys' as the list ##([up])##, then
the `up' key will perform prefix cycling, not modal cycling.






----
[:icicle-default-cycling-mode]
==== Option icicle-default-cycling-mode ====

User option '''`icicle-default-cycling-mode'''' determines the
completion mode to be used before you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.
This affects only modal cycling -- e.g. using keys such as `down'
and `C-down'.  Values:

* `prefix'  (default) means cycle prefix completions
* `apropos' means cycle apropos completions
* other non-`nil' value means cycle inputs from the input history
* `nil' means do not cycle: you must first hit a completion key

For example, if the value is `apropos' then you can immediately
cycle apropos completions without first hitting `S-TAB'.

Once you have used `TAB' or `S-TAB', the only way to traverse
the input history is to use `M-p' and `M-n'.

----
[:icicle-word-completion-keys]
==== Option icicle-word-completion-keys ====

User option '''`icicle-word-completion-keys'''' is a list of keys to use for
  word completion.  By default, the only such key is `M-SPC'.


----
[:icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys]
[:icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys]
==== Options icicle-apropos-complete-no-display and `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys' ====

User option '''`icicle-apropos-complete-no-display-keys'''' is a list
of keys to bind to `icicle-apropos-complete-no-display'.  By
default, these keys are `C-M-S-tab' and `C-M-S-iso-lefttab',
which together implement `C-M-S-TAB'.
Similarly, '''`icicle-prefix-complete-no-display-keys'''' is the list
of keys for `icicle-prefix-complete-no-display'.  By default, the only such
key is `C-M-tab'.


----
[:icicle-prefix-complete-keys]
==== Option icicle-prefix-complete-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-prefix-complete-keys'''' is the list of keys for
`icicle-prefix-complete'.  By default, these keys are `tab' and
`C-i', which together implement `TAB'.


----
[:icicle-apropos-complete-keys]
==== Option icicle-apropos-complete-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-apropos-complete-keys'''' is
the list of keys to bind to `icicle-apropos-complete'.  By default, these keys are `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', which together implement `S-TAB'.
(In Emacs 22 and later, `backtab' is the canonical key that
represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab', so that is used in
the default value.)


----
[:icicle-key-complete-keys]
==== Option icicle-key-complete-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-key-complete-keys'''' is the list of keys to bind to
`icicle-complete-keys'.  By default, this is the singleton list
##([backtab])##.  The `backtab' key is the canonical key that
represents both `S-tab' and `S-iso-lefttab'.  All three of these
keys implement `S-TAB'.


----
[:icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer]
==== Option icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer ====

Option '''`icicle-key-complete-keys-for-minibuffer'''' is the list of
keys that '''Icicles''' binds to `icicle-complete-keys' in the minibuffer
keymaps.  By default, this is the singleton list ##([M-backtab])##,
which means `M-S-TAB'.  `S-TAB' itself is of course used (by
default) for apropos completion of your minibuffer input, so it
cannot also be used for key completion in the minibuffer.  If your window manager steals `M-S-TAB' then
customize this option to choose another key, or try `ESC S-TAB'
(equivalent to `M-S-TAB').



----
[:icicle-complete-keys-ignored-prefix-keys]
==== Option icicle-complete-keys-ignored-prefix-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-complete-keys-ignored-prefix-keys'''' is a list of
[[prefix key]]s to be ignored by `icicle-complete-keys' (`S-TAB').
What this really means is that you can bind
`icicle-complete-keys' to a key sequence that uses one of these
prefix keys, and when you invoke it that way it acts as if
invoked at top level.  Otherwise, it would show you only the
keys bound on that prefix key.  This gives you a way to invoke
top-level key completion from a key sequence that uses a prefix
key.




----
[:icicle-isearch-complete-keys]
==== Option icicle-isearch-complete-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-isearch-complete-keys'''' is the list of keys for
`icicle-isearch-complete'.  By default, these keys are `M-TAB',
`##ESC TAB##' and `C-M-TAB'.




----
[:icicle-isearch-history-insert-keys]
==== icicle-isearch-history-insert-keys ====

Option '''`icicle-isearch-history-insert-keys'''' is the list of keys
for `icicle-isearch-history'.  By default, the list contains
only '''`M-o''''.




----
[:icicle-read-insert-file-name-keys]
[:icicle-completing-read-insert-keys]
==== Options icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys, icicle-completing-read+insert-keys ====

Option '''`##icicle-read+insert-file-name-keys##'''' is the list of keys
for invoking file-name completion on demand. By default,
`C-M-S-f' is the only such key.
Option '''`##icicle-completing-read+insert-keys##'''' is the list of keys for
invoking non file-name completion on demand.  By default,
`C-M-S-c' is the only such key. 
See [[Icicles - Completion On Demand]].  


----
[:icicle-act-before-cycle-flag]
==== Option icicle-act-before-cycle-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-act-before-cycle-flag'''' `nil' means that keys
such as `C-next', which combine candidate action and [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]],
cycle to the next (or previous) candidate and act on it.
Non-`nil' means they act on the current candidate and then cycle
to the next (or previous) candidate.  When the value is `nil', you
can think of `C-next' as an operation on the next candidate.
When the value is non-`nil', you can think of `C-next' as an
operation on the current candidate, which ends by making the
next candidate current.  Similarly for the other cycling keys
that act, alternative-act, or show help on a candidate  The default value is `nil'.  See also option
`<tt>[[#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]]</tt>', which changes the keys affected
by `icicle-act-before-cycle-flag'.


----
[:icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]
==== Option icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag ====

If option '''`icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag'''' is `nil', then the keys
that [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] candidates are swapped with the keys that both cycle and act on
a candidate.  You can then use `down', `up', `next', `prior', `end', and `home'
to both cycle and act, and `C-down', `C-up', `C-next', 
`C-prior', `C-end', and `C-home' to merely cycle, without acting (e.g. navigating).
The option has no effect on other keys.  You can ''toggle'' this
option at any time using '''`M-g'''' (`icicle-toggle-C-for-actions')
in the minibuffer. See [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|More about Multi-Commands]].

The keys mentioned here are the default bindings.  The actual
keys swapped are those defined by these user options:
* `<tt>[[#icicle-prefix-cycle-next-action-keys]]</tt>'
* `<tt>[[#icicle-prefix-cycle-previous-action-keys]]</tt>'
* `<tt>[[#icicle-apropos-cycle-next-action-keys]]</tt>'

----
[:icicle-find-file-expand-directory-flag]
==== Option icicle-find-file-expand-directory-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-find-file-expand-directory-flag''''
prevents the choice of a directory-name candidate using `RET' or `mouse-2' during file-name
completion from opening [[Dired]] on
the directory.  Instead, '''Icicles''' cycles into the directory,
presenting its contents as the completion candidates.  It thus makes `RET' behave like `C-M-/'.   The option has no such effect
on [[multi-command]] candidate-action keys such as `C-RET' and
`C-mouse-2'.  You can toggle this option using
'''`C-x /''''.




----
[:icicle-TAB-S-TAB-only-completes-flag]
==== Option icicle-TAB/S-TAB-only-completes-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-TAB/S-TAB-only-completes-flag'''' inhibits
`TAB' and `S-TAB' (actually the keys that are the values of
options `icicle-prefix-complete-keys' and
`icicle-apropos-complete-keys') from also ''[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]'' candidates.




----
[:icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag]
==== Option icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-TAB-shows-candidates-flag'''' means
that hitting `TAB' for prefix completion immediately shows the
completion candidates in buffer `*Completions*'.  If `nil', then
candidates are shown only after `TAB' is hit a second time,
which is the standard Emacs behavior.  The default value is `t'. (Actually, the concerned keys are those defined by option
`<tt>[[#icicle-prefix-complete-keys]]</tt>', not necessarily `TAB'.)



----
[:icicle-max-candidates]
==== Option `icicle-max-candidates' ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-max-candidates'''' means truncate the list of completion
candidates to at most this many.  If you use library <tt>[[doremi.el]]</tt> then you can
use '''`C-x #'''' during completion to increment or decrement the
option value using the vertical arrow keys or the mouse wheel.  A numeric prefix argument for `C-x #' sets the increment size.  A plain prefix argument (`C-u') resets `icicle-max-candidates' to `nil', meaning no
truncation.







----
[:icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]
==== Option icicle-expand-input-to-common-match ====

User option '''`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'''' controls whether completion expands your minibuffer
input to (typically) the longest common substring common to all completion
candidates and that matches your (complete) input pattern.  The option controls whether and when such expansion takes place.  The possible values are:

* '''##0##''' -- ''Never'' expand your typed input, except when you use `C-M-TAB' or `C-M-S-TAB'.

* '''##1##''' -- Expand it only when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB', that is,
''explicit completion'', not incremental completion -- no automatic expansion.

* '''##2##''' -- Same as ##1##, but also automatically expand it when it ''matches only one'' completion candidate.

* '''##3##''' -- Same as ##2##, but also automatically expand it during
''incremental prefix'' completion.

* '''##4##''' -- Same as ##3##, but also automatically expand it during
incremental apropos completion.  IOW, ''always'' expand it.


As the value increases there are thus more contexts in which
your input can be expanded to the common match.

You can ''toggle'' the value of this option at any time using '''`##C-"##''''
in the minibuffer.  This in fact swaps the values of this option
and option '''`<tt>[[#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-alt]]</tt>''''.  That is the only purpose of the latter option: to let you go switch
`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' back and forth between two
values.

You can ''cycle'' the value of `icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'
among all its possible values using '''`##C-M-"##'''' in the minibuffer.
Together with `##C-"##', this also lets you change the value of
`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match-alt': Use `##C-M-"##' to cycle
to the value you want as the alternative, then use `##C-"##' to
swap.  Then use `##C-M-"##' to cycle to the value you want for
`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'.

Input expansion ''replaces your input'' in the minibuffer.  If you
want to edit your original, pre-expansion input, use '''`C-l''''.  If
you are also cycling among candidates then you might need to hit
`C-l' twice.  One reason you might want to set
`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' to a value other than ##4## is
if you want to always work with a [[regexp]] in the minibuffer when
you use [[Icicles - Apropos Completions|apropos completion]].  (With a value of ##4## the regexp is
replaced automatically by the match expansion.)

----
[:icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag]
==== Option icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-hide-common-match-in-Completions-flag'''' hides, in buffer `*Completions*', the common match for your current input from each candidate.  You can toggle this anytime during
completion using '''`##C-x .##'''' (no [[prefix argument]]), which is bound to command `icicle-toggle-hiding-common-match'.    The common match used is governed by option `<tt>[[#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match|icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]'.



----
[:icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag]
==== icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag'''' hides, in
buffer `*Completions*', all lines in multi-line candidates that
do not match your current minibuffer input.  In Emacs 22+,
consecutive such lines are elided as '''`##...##''''.  You can toggle this
option anytime during completion using '''`##C-u C-x .##'''', which is
bound to command '''`icicle-toggle-hiding-non-matching-lines''''.

Hiding non-matching lines can be especially useful when
candidates are large (many lines), such as full function
definitions (e.g., from `icicle-imenu-full').

----
[:icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag]
==== Option icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag'''' controls
whether or not buffer `*Completions*' is shown initially, without your
needing to hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to show it.  However, if
you type something before `<tt>[[#icicle-incremental-completion-delay]]</tt>',
then display is inhibited.  The default value is `nil',
meaning that `*Completions*' is not shown until you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB'.  More typical than setting this option to non-`nil' globally is to ''bind'' it to non-`nil' in EmacsLisp code, to display `*Completions*' as a ''menu''. For example, pass a non-`nil' binding to `icicle-define-command' to create a command that displays a multiple-choice menu.

For an alternative but similar behavior to using non-`nil' for
`icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag', you can set option
`<tt>[[#icicle-incremental-completion]]</tt>' to a value that is neither
`nil' nor `t'.  That displays `*Completions*' as soon as you type
or delete input, but not initially.

----
[:icicle-incremental-completion]
==== Option icicle-incremental-completion====

User option '''`icicle-incremental-completion-flag'''' controls whether or not `*Completions*' is updated incrementally (icompletion) as you type. 
You can cycle the option among its three possible
values at any time using '''`<tt>C-#</tt>''''. For more
information, see [[Icicles - Icompletion]].

Note: Several [[Icicles - Tripping|tripping (navigating) commands]], including '''Icicles''' [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview|search commands]], bind option `icicle-incremental-completion' to
`always', because I think you typically want to start them out
with incremental completion turned on.  Remember that you can
use `<tt>C-#</tt>' (once or twice) to turn incremental completion off.



----
[:icicle-incremental-completion-delay] [:icicle-incremental-completion-threshold]
==== Options icicle-incremental-completion-delay, icicle-incremental-completion-threshold ====

User options '''`icicle-incremental-completion-delay'''' and
'''`icicle-incremental-completion-threshold'''' together cause a delay
before incremental completion takes effect.  See [[Icicles - Icompletion]].




----
[:icicle-sorting-max-candidates]
==== Option icicle-sorting-max-candidates ====

User option '''`icicle-sorting-max-candidates'''' automatically
toggles candidate sorting off and on, depending on the current
number of candidates.  Set it to `nil' to turn off such
toggling.  Set it to a larger or smaller maximum number of
candidates to reduce or increase its effect.  See also
[[Icicles - Sorting Candidates]].



----
[:icicle-icomplete-mode-max-candidates]
==== Option icicle-icomplete-mode-max-candidates ====

User option '''`icicle-icomplete-mode-max-candidates'''' automatically
toggles [[IcompleteMode|Icomplete mode]] off and on, depending on the current
number of candidates.  Set it to `nil' to turn off such
toggling.  Set it to a larger or smaller maximum number of
candidates to reduce or increase its effect.  This option has no
effect for Emacs versions prior to Emacs 23.  See also
[[Icicles - Icompletion#UsingIciclesWithIcomplete|Using Icicles with Icomplete Mode ]].


----
[:icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars]
==== Option icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars ====

User option '''`icicle-Completions-display-min-input-chars'''' is the
minimum number of input characters that allow buffer
`*Completions*' to remain displayed.  By default, this is zero
(0), meaning that any number of input characters, even none,
allows `*Completions*' to remain displayed.  If you use
incremental completion (see options `<tt>[[#icicle-incremental-completion-delay|icicle-incremental-completion-*]]</tt>'),
and you are bothered by `*Completions*' being automatically
updated when, for instance, you empty the minibuffer, then you
might want to set this option to, say, 1 or 2.  With a value of
2, for instance, whenever the minibuffer input has less than 2
characters, incremental completion will remove the `*Completions*'
[[window]].  You can also remove the `*Completions*' window at any
time using 
'''`C-x 0'''' in the minibuffer.

----
[:icicle-keep-Completions-for-sole-dir]
==== Option icicle-keep-Completions-for-sole-dir ====

Option '''`icicle-keep-Completions-for-sole-dir'''' controls what
happens during (non-absolute) file-name completion when the only
match for your input is a directory name.  If the value is `nil'
then remove the `*Completions*' window.  If it is the symbol
`pop-up' then update `*Completions*' unconditionally to show the
sole candidate --- show `*Completions*' if it was not yet showing.
If it is any other non-`nil' value then update `*Completions*'
if it is showing, and do nothing otherwise.  The default value
is `t', giving this update-if-shown-else-remove behavior.


----
[:icicle-show-Completions-help-flag]
[:icicle-Completions-instruction-1]
[:icicle-Completions-instruction-2]
==== Option icicle-show-Completions-help-flag, Faces icicle-Completions-instruction-1 and -2 ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-show-Completions-help-flag'''' means display help
(instructions) at the top of the buffer that shows completions (typically `*Completions*').  These instructions are shown in faces '''`icicle-Completions-instruction-1'''' and '''`icicle-Completions-instruction-2''''.  If `nil', the completion
candidates are shown alone (no help text), but if there are no
candidates then text stating that fact is printed in the buffer.

----
[:icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay]
==== Option icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay ====

Option '''`icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay'''' is the number of seconds to display 
help on individual completion candidates in the [[mode line]] as you [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] or your input is completed.  The mode-line that is used is that of buffer `*Completions*', if
it is displayed, or the current buffer, otherwise.  Typically,
this mode-line candidate help is the first line of a [[doc string]],
but alternative help is available.

Regardless of the option value, a user event (e.g. a [[key]] press)
always interrupts (terminates) this help display.

Note that
`post-command-hook' actions do not take place until this display
is finished.  For example, if the help is shown
because your input is complete, then [[IcompleteMode|Icomplete]] will not show
additional candidates (e.g. with the same input as a prefix)
until the mode-line help has finished.  This is because
Icomplete display is a `post-command-hook' action.

----
[:icicle-mode-line-help]
==== Face icicle-mode-line-help ====

Face '''`icicle-mode-line-help'''' is used to highlight '''Icicles''' help
shown in the [[mode line]].  This includes that controlled by option `<tt>[[#icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay]]</tt>' and the indication in
`*Completions*' of the total number of matching candidates.



----
[:icicle-Completions-mouse-3-menu-entries]
==== Option icicle-Completions-mouse-3-menu-entries ====

User option '''`icicle-Completions-mouse-3-menu-entries'''' defines
the contextual menu that is popped up when you click '''`C-mouse-3''''
on a candidate in `*Completions*'.  As an aid to customizing it,
refer to any of the constants '''`icicle-Completions-*'''' that define
its submenus.  The submenu definitions are easier to understand
in the source code (<tt>[[icicles-opt.el]]</tt>), because [[Customize]] does not pretty-print them.  You can see screenshots of the default menu and its submenus [[Icicles - Nutshell View#CompletionPopupMenu|here]].






----
[:icicle-move-Completions-frame]
==== Option icicle-move-Completions-frame ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-move-Completions-frame'''' means that `icicle-candidate-action' moves the frame showing buffer
`*Completions*' to the edge of the display, out of the way of other frames.   The possible non-`nil' values are `right' and
`left', specifying the display edge to use.
This option can be useful if you use one-[[buffer]]-per-[[frame]] (non-`nil'
`pop-up-frames').  In that case, I recommend that you also try my
library '''<tt>[[oneonone.el]]</tt>'''.  See [[Icicles - pop-up-frames on MS Windows]] for more advice about
non-`nil' `pop-up-frames'.

----
[:icicle-Completions-window-max-height]
==== Option icicle-Completions-window-max-height ====

User option '''`icicle-Completions-window-max-height'''' is the
maximum height of the `*Completions*' window, in [[line]]s.  The
window is fit to the buffer size, with this as maximum height.
This is not used if `*Completions*' is a [[special display buffer]] with its
own frame, and it is not used in Emacs releases prior to 21.

----
[:icicle-Completions-text-scale-decrease]
==== Option icicle-Completions-text-scale-decrease ====

Starting with Emacs 23, you can use option
'''`icicle-Completions-text-scale-decrease'''' to change the size of
the text used in buffer `*Completions*'.

----
[:icicle-candidate-width-factor]
==== Option icicle-candidate-width-factor ====

User option '''`icicle-candidate-width-factor'''' controls how many
columns of completion candidates are displayed in `*Completions*'.
The widest current candidate is scaled by this percentage, and
the window width is divided by that figure.  Other things are
taken into account also, but this gives you a way to tweak the
number of columns: the larger this number, the fewer the
columns.

If you use '''DoReMi''' (library <tt>[[doremi.el]]</tt>), then you can modify
`icicle-candidate-width-factor' incrementally during completion,
seeing the effect as it changes.  Use '''`C-x w'''' from the
minibuffer, then use the `right' and `left' arrow keys or the
mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at the same time use the `up' and `down' keys to adjust the value of `<tt>[[#icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces]]</tt>'.  WYSIWYG.

----
[:icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces]
==== Option icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces ====

User option '''`icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces'''' is the minimum
number of spaces between candidates displayed in `*Completions*'.
The default value is one space.

If you use '''DoReMi''' (library <tt>[[doremi.el]]</tt>), then you can modify
`icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces' incrementally during completion,
seeing the effect as it changes.  Use '''`##C-x |##'''' from the
minibuffer, then use the `up' and `down' arrow keys or the
mouse wheel to increment and decrement the value.  You can at the same time use the `left' and `right' keys to adjust the value of `<tt>[[#icicle-candidate-width-factor]]</tt>'.  WYSIWYG.



----
[:icicle-Completions-max-columns]
==== Option icicle-Completions-max-columns ====

Option '''`icicle-Completions-max-columns'''' imposes a maximum number
of columns for the `*Completions*' [[Icicles - Completions Display|display]], thus preventing
'''Icicles''' from automatically calculating the number of columns.
It is available in case you really want to do that, but I
recommend that you leave the value of this option `nil' and you
use only options <tt>`[[#icicle-inter-candidates-min-spaces]]'</tt> and
<tt>`[[#icicle-candidate-width-factor]]'</tt> to control columns and candidate
spacing.



----
[:icicle-image-files-in-Completions]
==== Option icicle-image-files-in-Completions ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-image-files-in-Completions'''' means that
thumbnail images are shown in `*Completions*' for candidates
that are either (relative or absolute) names of image files or names of image-file bookmarks (see '''[[Bookmark+]]''').  The default value is `t'.  If
the value is '''`image-only'''', then only the thumbnail images are    shown.  If it is otherwise non-`nil' then the file names are also
shown.  You can cycle the option value using '''`C-x t'''' in the
minibuffer at any time during completion.  This feature is
available starting with Emacs 22.



----
[:icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip]
==== Option icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip'''' means that if
`tooltip-mode' is on then passing the mouse over an image-file
candidate in `*Completions*' can pop up a tooltip showing a
preview of the image.  If the value is '''`full'''' then a full-size
image is shown.  If the value is a positive integer then a
thumbnail image of that size is shown.

However, thumbnail
tooltips are not shown if thumbnails are already shown in
`*Completions*', that is, if `icicle-image-files-in-Completions'
is non-`nil' and `icicle-image-preview-in-tooltip' is not
`full'.




----
[:icicle-completions-format]
==== Option icicle-completions-format ====

Option '''`icicle-completions-format'''' controls whether candidates
displayed in `*Completions*' are laid out horizontally (the
default) or vertically.  Set the value to `vertical' for the
latter.  Starting with Emacs 23.2, you can just use the vanilla
option `completions-format' for this, if you want the same type
of layout with ''Icicle'' mode turned on or off.

'''Icicles''' always displays multi-line candidates in a single
column, for readability.  When this is the case, the completions
format (horizontal or vertical) makes no difference -- the effect
is the same.  ('''Icicles''' also inserts an empty line after each
multi-line candidate, for readability.)

You can toggle the completions layout between horizontal and
vertical at any time during completion, using '''`##C-M-^##''''.




----
[:icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag]
==== Option icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag ====

If option '''`icicle-menu-items-to-history-flag'''' is non-`nil' (the
default), then commands that you invoke using the [[menu bar]] menu
are included in the command history for `M-x'.



----
[:icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag]
==== Option icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-populate-interactive-history-flag'''' means
that any interactive use of a [[command]] causes it to be added to
the history '''`icicle-interactive-history''''.  You can access this
history by using '''`C-M-pause'''' during completion.  Be aware that
addition of all interactive invocations to this history can slow
Emacs down.  (This option is only available starting with Emacs
23.)



----
[:icicle-sort-comparer]
==== Option icicle-sort-comparer ====

User option '''`icicle-sort-comparer'''' controls the ''order of
completion candidates'' during [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]]and in buffer `*Completions*'.
If `nil', then no sorting is done.  If non-`nil', then the value must be a
string-comparison function -- the function is passed to the
standard function `sort' to do the sorting.  The default value for `icicle-sort-comparer' is `icicle-case-string-less-p',
which sorts alphabetically, possibly ignoring letter case.  During completion, you can ''toggle''
sorting using '''`##C-,##''''.  If
you are an Emacs-Lisp programmer and you write new commands using
'''Icicles''' functionalities, you can bind this variable temporarily to
any sort function you need. See [[Icicles - Sorting Candidates]].

----
[:icicle-alternative-sort-comparer]
==== Option icicle-alternative-sort-comparer ====

User option '''`icicle-alternative-sort-comparer'''' is an alternative
to `<tt>[[#icicle-sort-comparer]]</tt>', providing a different sort order.  By
default, it is `icicle-historical-alphabetic-p', a function that
sorts previously used completion candidates before candidates
that have not yet been used, and sorts alphabetically within
each of these groups of candidates.  In other words, it places
inputs that you have used previously at the top of buffer
`*Completions*' and makes them available for completion first.  During completion, you can ''toggle'' normal and alternative sorting
using '''`##M-,##''''.  See also `<tt>[[Icicles - History Enhancements#icicle-toggle-alternative-sorting|toggle-alternative-sorting]]</tt>' and [[Icicles - Sorting Candidates]].

----
[:icicle-change-sort-order-completion]
==== Option icicle-change-sort-order-completion ====

User option '''`icicle-change-sort-order-completion'''' specifies whether '''`##C-,##'''' and '''`##M-,##'''' cycle among available sort orders or they let you choose a sort order using '''Icicles''' completion.

The default value is 7, meaning cycle to the next order if there are no more than 7 sort orders currently available, but use completion to choose a sort order if there more than 7.  An option value of `nil' means always cycle, and a non-integer, non-`nil' value means always complete.

However, you can override the current option setting at any time by using a plain [[prefix argument]]: '''`##C-u C-,##'''' or '''`##C-u M-,##''''.  See [[Icicles - Sorting Candidates]].

----
[:icicle-sort-orders-alist]
==== Option icicle-sort-orders-alist ====

User option `icicle-sort-orders-alist' is an [[alist]] of possible
sort orders for user to choose from using `##C-,##' or `##M-,##'.  See
[[Icicles - Sorting Candidates]].

----
[:icicle-transform-function]
==== Option icicle-transform-function ====

The value of user option '''`icicle-transform-function'''' is a
function that is applied to the list of completion candidates,
to transform them before they are presented to the user.  If
`nil', then no transformation is done.  The default transformation
is to ''remove duplicate candidates'', when transformation is
active, but the default value of this option is `nil'.  You can
''toggle'' transformation at any time using command
`icicle-toggle-transformation', bound to '''`##C-$##'''' in the
minibuffer.  Although this is a user option, you probably do
'''''not''''' want to change its value by customizing it.  '''Icicles''' commands already "do
the right thing" when it comes to candidate transformation.

The value of this option can be changed by program locally, for use
in particular contexts.  For example, when you use '''`M-s M-s M-s'''' or  '''`##C-c `##''''
(`icicle-search-generic') in a `*shell*' buffer, '''Icicles''' uses this
variable with a value of `icicle-remove-duplicates', to remove
duplicate shell commands from your input history list.  Lisp
programmers can use this variable to transform the list of
candidates in any way they like.  A typical use is to remove
duplicates, by binding it to `icicle-remove-duplicates' or
`icicle-remove-dups-if-extras'.

==== Options icicle-require-match-flag, icicle-buffer-require-match-flag ====

User options '''`icicle-require-match-flag'''',
'''`icicle-buffer-require-match-flag'''', and '''`icicle-file-require-match-flag'''' let you override the value of
the `REQUIRE-MATCH' argument provided to `completing-read' or
`read-file-name'.  They are provided mainly for use (binding) in
`icicle-define-command' and `icicle-define-file-command', but
you may also use them globally, if you wish. A typical use is made in the definition of command
`icicle-buffer': `icicle-buffer-require-match-flag' is used to
bind `icicle-require-match-flag', so that you can, for example,
match only existing buffers and be able to match on partial
input without explicitly completing (hitting `TAB' or `S-TAB').
Simply set the option to `partial-match-ok' to get this
behavior.  To apropos-complete and exit the minibuffer, use
`S-RET' instead of `RET'.  See [[Icicles - S-RET]].

----
[:icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag]
==== Option icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag'''' means to
ignore [[buffer]]-name completion candidates that start with a space.
You can ''toggle'' `icicle-buffer-ignore-space-prefix-flag' using '''`##M-_##'''' in the minibuffer (except during `icicle-search').


----
[:icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag]
==== Option icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag'''' means
that '''Icicles''' tests for remote file names; `nil' means that it does
not.  You can ''toggle'' this using `##C-^##' in the minibuffer (except
during '''Icicles''' search).  Turning off remote file-name testing means that you ''cannot use remote files with Tramp''; it disables
Tramp's remote file-name handling and completion.  This can, for ''local files'', slightly speed up [[Icicles - Icompletion|incremental completion]]
and the highlighting of the part of your current input that does
not complete (see `<tt>[[#icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure]]</tt>').


----
[:icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag]
==== Option icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag''''
means that a file on a mapped MS Windows network drive is considered
remote.  This has an effect on things like [[Icicles - Icompletion#icicle-network-drive-means-remote-flag|incremental completion]].  You can toggle this option anytime
during completion using '''`##C-x :##''''.




----
[:icicle-regexp-quote-flag]
==== Option icicle-regexp-quote-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-regexp-quote-flag'''' reduces apropos
completion to simple ''substring completion'' and '''Icicles''' regexp
search to ''literal search''.  Regexp [[Icicles - Special Characters in Input Patterns|special characters]] are no longer recognized as special in this case;
they simply match themselves.  You probably do ''not'' want to
customize this option.  Instead, you can ''toggle'' it at any time
using '''`##C-`##'''' in the minibuffer.

User options '''`icicle-command-abbrev-match-all-parts-flag'''',
'''`icicle-command-abbrev-priority-flag'''', and
'''`icicle-command-abbrev-alist'''' control the behavior of
multi-command `icicle-command-abbrev' ('''`C-x SPC'''').  The first
determines whether an abbreviation must match all parts of a
command name.  The second controls whether command names or
abbreviations take precedence in case of conflict.  The third is
the persistent list of your command abbreviations.

[:icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist]

[:icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method]
[:icicle-next-TAB-completion-method]
==== Options icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist and icicle-TAB-completion-methods ====
User options '''`icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist'''' and
'''`icicle-TAB-completion-methods'''' control which completion method
is used by `S-TAB' and `TAB', respectively, to complete your input.  By default,
the first method in each list is used for matching. You can use '''`##M-(##'''' and '''`##C-(##''''  (commands `icicle-next-S-TAB-completion-method' and `icicle-next-TAB-completion-method') in the minibuffer to cycle
among the `S-TAB' and `TAB' methods. See [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion#icicle-S-TAB-completion-methods-alist|Icicles - Fuzzy Completion]].

For fuzzy completion (choice `fuzzy' when cycling with `##C-(##'),
`TAB' completes non-filename input using fuzzy prefix matching
as defined in library <tt>[[fuzzy-match.el]]</tt>.  See the Commentary in
##fuzzy-match.el## for details about fuzzy matching.
Fuzzy completion is not available for file-name completion; it
is always case-sensitive; leading spaces are taken into
account; and completion candidates are always sorted by
decreasing fuzzy match strength.  In other words, fuzzy completion is
not affected by `C-A', `##M-_##', or `##C-,##'.

----
[:icicle-levenshtein-distance]
==== Option icicle-levenshtein-distance ====

User option '''`icicle-levenshtein-distance'''' is the Levenshtein
distance allowed for strings to be considered as matching during
N-off completion.  This means that two strings match if they
differ by at most this many character operations (insertion,
deletion, replacement).  This option is used only if you have
library <tt>[[levenshtein.el]]</tt>.  See [[Icicles - Fuzzy Completion#NOffCompletion|Icicles - Fuzzy Completion]].

Top-level command `icicle-search' uses several faces to highlight
found text that matches your input.  Faces '''`icicle-search-main-regexp-current'''' and '''`icicle-search-main-regexp-others''''
highlight what your search-[[context regexp]] (entered with `RET')
matches.  The former highlights the current [[search context]]; the latter highlights all other search contexts.

Face '''`icicle-search-current-input'''' highlights what your
current input matches (typically another regexp); that is, it highlights a match within a search context.  Faces '''`icicle-search-context-level-1'''' through
'''`icicle-search-context-level-8'''' highlight the first eight regexp
subgroup matches, within a search context.  This highlighting is
done whenever `<tt>[[#icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag]]</tt>' is
non-`nil' and the search context corresponds to the entire regexp.  See [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].


----
[:icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag]
==== Option icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag''''
controls highlighting of regexp subgroup matches within the
search context.  Non-`nil' (the default value) means highlight
them.  See [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].


----
[:icicle-search-highlight-threshold]
==== Option icicle-search-highlight-threshold ====

User option '''`icicle-search-highlight-threshold'''' controls
highlighting with face `<tt>[[#icicle-search-main-regexp-others]]</tt>': this
many matches, maximum, are highlighted.  If `t' then there is no
maximum (no limit).  If zero, then only the
current match is highlighted.  See [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].


----
[:icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag]
==== Option icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag''''
means highlight what your current input matches inside ''all'' main search hits at
the ''same time''.  If `<tt>[[#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt>'
is '''##3##''' or '''##4##''' (which means your input can be automatically prefix- or apropos-expanded, respectively),
then what is highlighted for each input match is 
the [[Icicles - Expanded-Common-Match Completion|expanded common match]] among all input matches throughout the search area.  Otherwise, only the exact input match is highlighted.

The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is `nil', because non-`nil' can
impact performance negatively if there are many search contexts -- the highlighting is
updated with each input change.  You can ''toggle'' the value at any time using command
`icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to '''`##C-^##'''' in the minibuffer (except during file-name completion).  See [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]].

----
[:icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag]

If, in addition to `<tt>[[#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt>' causing your input to be expanded and `<tt>[[#icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag]]</tt>' being non-`nil', option
'''`icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag'''' is also non-`nil', then
a search replacement replaces the [[Icicles - Expanded-Common-Match Completion|expanded common match]].
Otherwise, it replaces only the exact match.  You can ''toggle'' `icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag' at any time using '''`##M-;##'''' in the minibuffer.



----
[:icicle-search-cleanup-flag] [:icicle-search-highlight-cleanup]
==== Option icicle-search-cleanup-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-search-cleanup-flag'''' 
means that `icicle-search' highlighting is removed after the
search.  This is the default behavior. If you set this to `nil' then you can remove search
highlighting manually later using command
'''`icicle-search-highlight-cleanup''''.  You can ''toggle'' this search
highlight removal at any time using command
'''`icicle-toggle-search-cleanup'''', which is bound to '''`##C-.##'''' in the minibuffer during '''Icicles''' search.

One use of `nil' `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to ''highlight'' regexp matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files or...).  In that capacity, '''Icicles''' search functions act like some of the highlighting commands in my library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt> (see HighLight).  Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is `nil', ''all'' '''Icicles''' search highlighting remains: last-visited
search context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
regexp subgroups.  The faces for these are, respectively:

* `icicle-search-main-regexp-current'
* `icicle-search-main-regexp-others'
* `icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here' (everywhere, if
`icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-`nil')

----
[:icicle-search-whole-word-flag]
==== Option icicle-search-whole-word-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-search-whole-word-flag'''' means that
whole-word search is done.  You can use `M-q' while searching to toggle this option; the newvalue takes effect for the next complete search.

Whole-word searching here means that
matches can contain embedded strings of non word-constituent
chars (they are skipped over, when matching, included in the
match), and any leading or trailing word-constituent chars in
the search string are dropped (ignored for matching, not
included in the match).  This means, for instance, that you can
match `foo-bar' as a word, even in contexts (such as EmacsLisp)
where `-' is not a word-constituent character.  Similarly, you
can include embedded whitespace in a "word", e.g., `##foo bar##'.

----
[:icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag]
==== Option icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag ====

If user option '''`icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag''''
 is `nil', then whatever matches your ''current input'' is replaced,
  within the current search context, when you perform replacement
 during '''Icicles''' searching (e.g. `S-C-RET').  If the value is
 non-`nil' (the default value), then the entire ''search context'' is
 replaced, instead.  You can use '''`##M-_##'''' at any time during
 searching and replacing, to ''toggle'' the value.  See [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]].

----
[:icicle-search-replace-literally-flag]
==== Option icicle-search-replace-literally-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-search-replace-literally-flag'''' determines
whether '''Icicles''' search-and-replace replaces text literally or
interprets '''`##\##'''' specially in the replacement text, as in
`query-replace-regexp'.  Non-`nil' means to treat replacement text
literally.  The default value is `nil'.  You can use '''`##M-`##'''' to
''toggle'' this at any time during '''Icicles''' search.   See [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]].


----
[:icicle-ignore-comments-flag]
==== Option icicle-ignore-comments-flag ====

* Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-ignore-comments-flag'''' means that
`icicle-search-thing' and related commands
(e.g. `icicle-search-xml-element') ignore comments.  That is,
they hide comments temporarily while they scan the [[region]] or
buffer for things of the given type to serve as search contexts
(completion candidates).  This prevents them, for example, from
presenting as a candidate a [[sexp]] or a [[list]] that is commented
out.  You can toggle this option anytime using '''`##C-M-;##'''' in the
minibuffer, but to see the effect you might need to invoke the
current command again.



----
[:icicle-search-hook]

----
[:icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag]
==== Option icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-bookmark-refresh-cache-flag'''' determines
whether commands such as `icicle-bookmark' and `icicle-search-bookmark'
refresh the bookmark-list cache.  The default value of `t',
meaning refresh, ensures that the set of
bookmark candidates is always up-to-date, but you can improve
performance for a large bookmark list if you customize it to
`nil'.

In any case, a plain [[prefix argument]] (`C-u') for these commands overrides
the default setting of the option for the duration of the command.  Thus, if
the customized value is `nil', you can use `C-u' occasionally to refresh the
list on demand.  In addition,
the cache is refreshed whenever you use `S-delete' to delete a
candidate bookmark.

User options '''`icicle-buffer-match-regexp'''',
'''`icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp'''', '''`icicle-buffer-predicate'''', and
'''`icicle-buffer-extras'''' determine the behavior of '''Icicles''' buffer commands, such as 
`icicle-buffer' and `icicle-insert-buffer'.  They determine the set of ''buffer-name''
candidates available for completion.

The first three
restrict this set to names that satisfy the properties they
specify.  Option '''`icicle-buffer-extras'''' lets you add additional
buffer names to the set of candidates, after restriction by the
other options.  Extra buffer-name candidates
are displayed in buffer `*Completions*' using face `<tt>[[#icicle-extra-candidate]]</tt>'.  Note that if an extra candidate is already a candidate anyway
then it will be present twice in the list of all candidates
(that is, unless `icicle-transform-function' removes duplicate
candidates).

Note that `icicle-buffer-predicate' is applied after matching
against user input.  It thus corresponds to
`<tt>[[#icicle-must-pass-after-match-predicate]]</tt>', not to
`<tt>[[#icicle-must-pass-predicate]]</tt>'.

Options '''`icicle-file-match-regexp'''',
'''`icicle-file-no-match-regexp'''', '''`icicle-file-predicate'''', and
'''`icicle-file-extras'''' act similarly for file-name completion.  You could use `icicle-file-no-match-regexp' or `icicle-file-predicate', for instance, to exclude files that are in or under the directories in `vc-directory-exclusion-list':

   (defun my-locate-non-vc-file ()
     "`icicle-locate-file', but excluding stuff in VC directories."
     (interactive)

It lets you choose what any given prefix argument (including
lack of a prefix argument) does to filter buffer-name completion
candidates.

[:icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag]

Options '''`icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag'''' and
'''`icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag'''' also determine the
behavior of commands `icicle-buffer' ('''`C-x b'''')
and`icicle-buffer-other-window' ('''`C-x 4 b'''').  They determine
whether the candidates available for completion include not only
existing [[buffer]] names but also the names of certain ''files'' that
are not currently visited.

For the former, these are the names cached by the Emacs
''file-name cache''.  For the latter, these are the names of
''recently visited files''.  See the Emacs manual, nodes [[Manual:File Name Cache|File Name Cache]] and [[Manual:File Conveniences|File Conveniences]], respectively.

You can toggle these options using '''`C-x F'''' and '''`C-x R'''',
respectively, during buffer-name completion.  The option values are not exactly Boolean, however.  They are
in fact non-zero integer values.  Each option is turned on when
positive and off when negative.

The absolute value of the
option is the maximum number of such candidates to include when
turned on.  So for example, if the latter option value is 20,
then the names of only the twenty most recently visited files are
candidates.

A [[prefix argument]] to `C-x F' or `C-x R' sets the option value to the [[numeric prefix argument]] value.

[:icicle-buffer-skip-functions]
[:icicle-file-skip-functions]
==== Options `icicle-buffer-skip-functions' and `icicle-file-skip-functions' ====

Options `icicle-buffer-skip-functions' and
'''`icicle-file-skip-functions'''' are lists of hook
functions.  They are used by commands that read buffer names or file names (for Emacs 23 and later) to test a candidate buffer name or file
name, respectively.  You can use them to skip content-searching of certain buffers and files when completing buffer and file names using [[multi-completion]]

The functions are passed to `run-hook-with-args-until-success',
so they are called in order until one returns non-`nil'.  If any
function returns non-`nil' then the buffer or file content is
not searched.  This is relevant only when your multi-completion
input has a second, content-matching part.



----
[:icicle-ignored-directories]
==== Option icicle-ignored-directories ====

Option '''`icicle-ignored-directories'''' is a list of directories
that are ignored by various '''Icicles''' commands, including `icicle-locate-file'.  By default, this is the value
of `vc-directory-exclusion-list'.



----
[:icicle-buffer-sort]
[:icicle-file-sort]
==== Options icicle-buffer-sort, icicle-file-sort ====

User option '''`icicle-buffer-sort'''' is a predicate used to sort
buffer-name candidates in '''Icicles''' buffer commands, such as `icicle-buffer' and `icicle-insert-buffer'.  Option '''`icicle-file-sort'''' acts similarly for file-name completion.
The default value of `icicle-buffer-sort'
is `##icicle-buffer-sort-*...*-last##', which sorts names of
buffers that begin with `*' after other buffer names.  These options
affect only the initial sort order used for buffer and file
names, respectively, that is, the order used first in an Emacs
session.  The values are also put first in the list of possible
sort orders for cycling (via '''`##C-,##'''').



----
[:icicle-buffer-configs]
==== Option icicle-buffer-configs ====

User option '''`icicle-buffer-configs'''' is a list of named
configurations of options `<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-match-regexp]]</tt>',
`<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-no-match-regexp]]</tt>', `<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-predicate]]</tt>',
`<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-extras]]</tt>', and `<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-sort]]</tt>'.  You use
''command'' `icicle-buffer-config' to choose one of the
configurations to be current.  You can use commands `icicle-add-buffer-config' and `icicle-remove-buffer-config' to add and remove configurations from the list.  ''Example:'' A configuration such
as the following, named "Files and Scratch", defines
`icicle-buffer-predicate' to display only file buffers, and it
defines `icicle-buffer-extras' to include the extra buffer
`*scratch*':

  ("Files and Scratch" nil nil
   (lambda (bufname) (buffer-file-name (get-buffer bufname)))
   ("*scratch*") icicle-sort-comparer)

The idea of buffer-option configurations was borrowed from library
`<code>bs.el</code>', by Olaf Sylvester <code><olaf@geekware.de></code>.

----
[:icicle-dot-string]
[:icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag]
==== Options icicle-dot-string and icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-dot-string'''' is the [[regexp]] string inserted by
`icicle-insert-dot-command' (bound to '''`##.##'''' in the minibuffer
during completion).  You can set it to a regexp that matches any character,
including newline.  The default value instead matches any character
except newline.  You can toggle between these two behaviors using
command `icicle-toggle-dot', bound to '''`##C-M-.##'''' during completion.

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-dot-show-regexp-flag'''' means show the
underlying regexp (value of constant `icicle-anychar-regexp') explicitly
for a multi-line dot ('''`##.##'''').  A `nil' value works only for Emacs
versions 21 and later.



----
[:icicle-show-annotations-flag]
==== Option icicle-show-annotations-flag ====


Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-show-annotations-flag'''' means show annotations, when available, next to candidates in `*Completions*'.  You can toggle this option from the minibuffer using '''`C-x C-a''''.



----
[:icicle-show-multi-completion-flag]
==== Option icicle-show-multi-completion-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-show-multi-completion-flag'''' means that for some commands additional information is shown along
with each completion candidate.  That is, a [[multi-completion]] is
used.  You can match against any parts of the multi-completion.
The default value is `t'.  (By contrast, you cannot match the
text controlled by option `icicle-show-annotations-flag'.)

For example, for command `icicle-search', the name of the buffer associated with each completion candidate is added
to the candidate and highlighted. You can match against the buffer name, as well as the search hit within the buffer. 

Note that even when the value of this option is `nil',
you can often see the multi-completion information in the [[mode line]] when you
[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] candidates, and you can typically see it in the help that is 
displayed by `C-M-mouse-2' and so on.

You can toggle this option from the minibuffer using '''`M-m''''.  The
new value takes effect after you exit the minibuffer (i.e., for
the next command).

----
[:icicle-kill-visited-buffers-flag]
==== Option icicle-kill-visited-buffers-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-kill-visited-buffers-flag'''' means
kill [[buffer]]s visited temporarily to search files.  This applies
to commands such as `<tt>[[Icicles - File-Name Input#icicle-find-file-of-content|icicle-file]]</tt>' (for Emacs 23 or later),
which search
files that match your completion input.  If non-`nil' then any
such buffers for files that you do not actually choose are
killed when the command is finished.  If `nil' then they are not
killed.  This option applies only to Emacs 23 and later.




----
[:icicle-list-join-string]
[:icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string]
==== Options icicle-list-join-string, icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string ====

User options '''`icicle-list-join-string'''' and '''`icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string'''' are described in [[Icicles - Multi-Completions]] and [[Icicles - Programming Multi-Completions]].  Option `icicle-list-join-string' is the separator string that joins
together the parts of a multi-completion.  The end string is
appended to each multi-completion candidate.  Option
`icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' specifies how the
multi-completion extracted parts are joined back together when a
user chooses a multi-completion.

The default value of `icicle-list-join-string' is '''`##^G^J##''''.  With
Emacs 22 and later, the `##^G##' part is hidden when it appears in
`*Completions*', and you can hide it in the minibuffer also by
using '''`C-M-j'''' instead of typing `C-q C-g C-j'.  See the [[doc string]] for more information.

----
[:icicle-candidate-part]
==== Face icicle-candidate-part ====

Face '''`icicle-candidate-part'''' highlights one or more parts of a
candidate, in buffer `*Completions*'.  The candidate is typically
a multi-completion.

----
[:icicle-special-candidate][:icicle-special-candidate-regexp]
==== Option icicle-special-candidate-regexp, Face icicle-special-candidate ====

Face '''`icicle-special-candidate'''' highlights candidates, in
`*Completions*', that are considered "special".  Generally, these
are candidates that match user option
'''`icicle-special-candidate-regexp''''.

----
[:icicle-key-complete-menu]
[:icicle-key-complete-menu-local]
==== Faces icicle-key-complete-menu-local and icicle-key-complete-menu ====

Faces '''`icicle-key-complete-menu-local'''' and
'''`icicle-key-complete-menu'''' highlight menu items during [[Icicles - Key Completion|key
completion]].  The former is for local menu items (i.e., specific
to the current mode).  The latter is for non-local menu items.

----
[:icicle-proxy-candidate']
==== Option icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag, Face icicle-proxy-candidate ====

Similarly, face '''`icicle-proxy-candidate'''' highlights '''proxy'''
candidates.  These are placeholders for real candidates.
Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag'''' means
include proxy candidates whenever there are any.  You can ''toggle'' this
option during completion using command `icicle-toggle-proxy-candidates', which is
bound to '''`##C-M-_##'''' in the minibuffer.  For performance reasons, you will in some cases
need to re-invoke the command to make the proxy candidates
available.


----
[:icicle-extra-candidate]
==== Face icicle-extra-candidate ====

Face '''`icicle-extra-candidate'''' highlights extra candidates, that
is, members of `<tt>[[#icicle-extra-candidates]]</tt>', `<tt>[[#icicle-buffer-extras]]</tt>',
or `<tt>[[#icicle-file-extras]]</tt>'.




----
[:icicle-kmacro-ring-max]
==== Option icicle-kmacro-ring-max ====

User option '''`icicle-kmacro-ring-max'''' acts as `kmacro-ring-max'
when you are in ''Icicle mode''.  (When you exit ''Icicle'' mode,
`kmacro-ring-max' is restored.)  In '''Icicles''', you will typically
want to use a much larger number than the default value in
vanilla Emacs.

----
[:icicle-regexp-search-ring-max] [:icicle-search-ring-max]
==== Options icicle-search-ring-max, icicle-regexp-search-ring-max ====

User options '''`icicle-regexp-search-ring-max'''' and
'''`icicle-search-ring-max'''' act as `regexp-search-ring-max' and
`search-ring-max', respectively, when you are in ''Icicle'' mode.
(When you exit ''Icicle'' mode, `regexp-search-ring-max' and
`search-ring-max' are restored.)  The reason for having these
options is that with '''Icicles''' you will likely want to use a much
longer search history.  By default, these are as large as
possible (virtually unlimited).   See [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements]].

'''Suggestion:''' If you use SaveHist (recommended), then
customize `savehist-additional-variables' to include variables
`search-ring' and `regexp-search-ring', so that your ''search
histories will be saved between Emacs sessions''.

[:clear-option]
'''Note:''' You can clear (empty) a given search history with command
'''`clear-option''''' (aka '''`icicle-reset-option-to-nil'''').  For example, to clear the
regular-expression search history, do this: `##C-u M-x clear-option RET regexp-search-ring RET##' (the `C-u' is needed because this variable is not a user option). If you use my library <tt>[[misc-cmds.el]]</tt>, you can clear search
histories easier, using commands `clear-search-history',
`clear-regexp-search-history', and `clear-search-histories'.   See [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements]].

----
[:icicle-completion-history-max-length] [:icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag]
==== Options icicle-completion-history-max-length, icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-completion-history-max-length'''' limits the
number of ''completion inputs'' to save.  If you customize user
option '''`icicle-C-l-uses-completion-flag'''' to non-`nil', then,
instead of cycling, `C-l' lets you use '''Icicles''' completion to
retrieve a past completion input.  (`##C-##'''##L##'''' does the same thing.)  If you use SaveHist (library ##savehist.el## or <tt>[[savehist-20+.el]]</tt>), then you can save the history
of completion inputs persistently by customizing user option
`savehist-additional-variables' to include the '''Icicles''' internal
variables `icicle-previous-raw-file-name-inputs' and `icicle-previous-raw-non-file-name-inputs'.

[:icicle-multi-command-completion]
[:icicle-mustmatch-completion]
==== Option icicle-highlight-lighter-flag and faces icicle-completion, icicle-multi-command-completion, icicle-mustmatch-completion ====

Faces '''`icicle-completion'''', '''`icicle-multi-command-completion'''', and '''`icicle-mustmatch-completion''''  indicate the status of
minibuffer completion.  During completion, '''Icicles''' uses them for
a minibuffer indicator and, if user option '''`icicle-highlight-lighter-flag''''
is non-`nil', for the `Icy' mode-line lighter as well.


----
[:icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag]
[:icicle-whitespace-highlight]
==== Option icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag, Face icicle-whitespace-highlight ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-highlight-input-initial-whitespace-flag''''
uses face '''`icicle-whitespace-highlight'''' to highlight any
whitespace that starts your minibuffer input.  This is done to
help you recognize accidentally typing such whitespace.
Otherwise, you might not understand the set of matching
completion candidates (or lack thereof).  There is not
necessarily anything wrong with input that starts with
whitespace -- it might be what you want, but without this
highlighting it is easy to not notice the whitespace.

==== Options icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure, icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay, icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold, Faces icicle-input-completion-fail, icicle-input-completion-fail-lax ====

The part of your current input that does not complete can be
highlighted automatically, and you can then remove that part
using `C-M-l'.  This highlighting is controlled by options `<tt>[[#icicle-incremental-completion]]</tt>', `<tt>[[#icicle-test-for-remote-files-flag]]</tt>', '''`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure'''', '''`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay'''', and '''`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-threshold''''.  The highlighting uses face '''`icicle-input-completion-fail'''' (for strict completion) or `icicle-input-completion-fail-lax' (for [[lax]] completion) to highlight the part
of your current input that does not complete.  Possible values control when highlighting can occur.  For details, see the option doc strings and [[Icicles - Icompletion#HighlightNonmatch|Highlight Nonmatch]].


----
[:icicle-define-alias-commands-flag]
==== Option icicle-define-alias-commands-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-define-alias-commands-flag'''' defines a few
top-level '''Icicles''' commands whose names do not begin with
`icicle-', for convenience when using `M-x'.  For example,
command `toggle' is defined as an alias for command
`icicle-toggle-option'.  In any case, no such command is ever
defined by '''Icicles''' if a function with the same name is already
defined.


----
[:icicle-color-themes]
==== Option icicle-color-themes ====

User option '''`icicle-color-themes'''' is a list of color themes to
[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] through when you use command `icicle-color-theme'.    You
need library [[ColorTheme|color-theme.el]] to use this command.


----
[:icicle-custom-themes]

[:icicle-custom-themes-accumulate-flag]
[:icicle-custom-themes-update-flag]
==== Options icicle-custom-themes, icicle-custom-themes-accumulate-flag, icicle-custom-themes-update-flag ====

Option '''`icicle-custom-themes'''' is a list of Emacs custom themes
to cycle through when you use command '''`icicle-custom-theme''''.
(This is available only for Emacs 24 and later.)  Option
'''`icicle-custom-themes-accumulate-flag'''' determines whether such
cycling keeps the effects of previously applied themes or
replaces each theme with the next one.  Option
'''`icicle-custom-themes-update-flag'''' determines whether the
command automatically saves changes made.  A [[prefix argument]]
flips this option value for the invocation of the command.



----
[:icicle-saved-completion-sets]
==== Option icicle-saved-completion-sets ====

User option '''`icicle-saved-completion-sets'''' is a persistent list of named sets of completion candidates.  You can switch among such sets at any time.  See [[Icicles - Persistent Completions]]

----
[:icicle-filesets-as-saved-completion-sets-flag]
==== Option icicle-filesets-as-saved-completion-sets-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-filesets-as-saved-completion-sets-flag''''
non-`nil' means you can use Emacs FileSets to save [[completion]] candidates
persistently.  This means that you can save file-name candidates
in a persistent '''Icicles''' saved completion set (cache file) or in
in an Emacs ''fileset''.  It also means that an '''Icicles''' persistent
completion set can ''contain'' filesets, in addition to file names:
any number of filesets, and filesets of different type.
Available only for Emacs 22 and later, and you must load library
##filesets.el## (and enable filesets using `##(filesets-init)##' -- see FileSets).

----
[:icicle-key-descriptions-use-angle-brackets-flag]
==== Option icicle-key-descriptions-use-angle-brackets-flag ====

User option '''`##icicle-key-descriptions-use-<>-flag##'''' (aka `icicle-key-descriptions-use-angle-brackets-flag') determines whether angle brackets (`##<##', `##>##') are used by '''Icicles''' for named [[key]]s, such as function keys (`##<f9>##' vs `f9') and pseudo keys (`##<mode-line>##' vs `mode-line').  Non-`nil' means to use angle brackets.  This option does not affect Emacs key descriptions outside of '''Icicles''', and it has no effect for versions of Emacs prior to 21, because they never use angle brackets.  The default value is `nil', because I think angle brackets reduce readability.   See also my library '''<tt>[[naked.el]]</tt>''', which lets you use
the no-angle-brackets style also outside of '''Icicles'''.

----
[:icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion]
==== Option icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion ====

User option '''`icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion'''' is a list of variables that are bound to [[keymap]]s in which you want to bind `S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
`<tt>[[#icicle-key-complete-keys]]</tt>') to `icicle-complete-keys'.  Each such keymap should have at least one [[prefix key]].  `S-TAB' is bound in each keymap, so that you can use it to complete the prefix keys.    See also `<tt>[[#icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag]]</tt>'.


----
[:icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag]
==== Option icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-complete-key-anyway-flag'''' means bind
`S-TAB' (actually, each of the keys in the value of option
`<tt>[[#icicle-key-complete-keys]]</tt>') to `icicle-complete-keys' in each
keymap of option `<tt>[[#icicle-keymaps-for-key-completion]]</tt>', regardless
of whether `S-TAB' already has a binding in that keymap.  A
value of `nil' means bind `S-TAB' only if there is not already a
binding.


----
[:icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-ranges]
==== Option icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-ranges ====

Non-nil option '''`icicle-complete-keys-self-insert-ranges'''' means that 
`icicle-complete-keys' includes some self-inserting keys as
completion candidates.  You will probably want to leave this `nil'.
This option has no effect before Emacs 22.  See [[Icicles - Key Completion#SelfInsert|Entering Special and Foreign Characters]].




----
[:icicle-yank-function]
[:icicle-yank-maybe-completing]
==== Option icicle-yank-function ====

User option '''`icicle-yank-function'''' is a function to use to yank
text.  By default, it is `yank'.  Command `icicle-yank-maybe-completing'
calls this function, except when it is called from the
minibuffer or called with a negative prefix argument.  ('''`C-- C-y'''' lets you choose yanks (kills) to
insert using completion.  It is a [[multi-command]].  You can of
course [[Icicles - Sorting Candidates|sort]] the candidates in various ways.)

----
[:icicle-use-candidates-only-once-flag]
==== Option icicle-use-candidates-only-once-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-use-candidates-only-once-flag'''' means
that acting on a candidate removes it from the set of available
candidates, so that you do not see that it can be used again.
(`TAB' or `S-TAB' makes it available again.)  The default value
is `nil', and you probably do not want to customize this.
However, if you write EmacsLisp code that uses completion, then
you can bind this to non-`nil' in contexts where that makes sense.

----
[:icicle-deletion-action-flag]
==== Option icicle-deletion-action-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-deletion-action-flag'''' means
`S-delete' during completion deletes the current object.  More
precisely, it deletes the object named by the current completion
candidate, if a deletion action is defined for the current
command.  If no deletion action is defined, then the value of
this option has no effect for that command.

----
[:icicle-alternative-actions-alist]
==== Option icicle-alternative-actions-alist ====

User option '''`icicle-alternative-actions-alist'''' is an [[alist]] that
associates Emacs [[command]]s and alternative action functions.  It
overrides any alternative actions defined otherwise for the
commands.

----
[:icicle-type-actions-alist]
==== Option icicle-type-actions-alist ====

User option '''`icicle-type-actions-alist'''' is an [[alist]] that
associates Emacs object types, such as buffer, file, and
process, with functions that accept an object of the given type
as their only required object.  This is used by some Emacs [[command]]s
during [[completion]] to prompt for a function to apply to the
current completion candidate.  Each function can be a [[symbol]] or
a [[lambda expression]].  At runtime, symbols that are not functions
(`functionp') are ignored.

----
[:icicle-use-anything-candidates-flag]
==== icicle-use-anything-candidates-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-use-anything-candidates-flag'''' means
[[Anything]] actions are used for candidate alternative actions in
some '''Icicles''' commands, and Anything types and actions are used
by command '''`icicle-object-action'''' (aka '''`what-which-how'''' and
'''`a'''').  The default value is `t'.  This option has no effect if
library <tt>[[anything.el]]</tt> cannot be loaded.

----
[:icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag]
==== Option icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-anything-transform-candidates-flag''''
means that [[Anything]] function `anything-transform-candidates' is
applied to displayed Anything candidates in '''Icicles'''.  The
default value is `nil'.

The advantage of a `nil' value is that command '''`icicle-anything'''' then acts
as a [[multi-command]]: you can act on multiple candidates, or apply
multiple actions for the same candidate, within a single
invocation of `icicle-anything' (or related commands).  The
advantage of a non-`nil' value is that some of the displayed
Anything candidates might be more readable.  The default value
is `nil'.  This option has no effect if library <tt>[[anything.el]]</tt>
cannot be loaded.

----
[:icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag]
==== Option icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag ====

User option '''`icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag'''' controls how some completion candidates such as [[face]], font,
and color names are displayed as candidates in `*Completions*'.
If the value is non-`nil', then a WYSIWYG ('''__W__'''hat '''__Y__'''ou '''__S__'''ee '''__I__'''s '''__W__'''hat '''__Y__'''ou
'''__G__'''et) sample is shown for the candidate.  For faces and colors, if the value is
a string, then the name is accompanied by a separate 
swatch showing that string text.  If the value is `t', then the
candidate name itself is shown using the face or color that it names.

You can use
command `icicle-toggle-WYSIWYG-Completions', bound to
'''`C-S-pause'''' during completion, to ''toggle'' this option, but the change
takes effect only for the next act of completion; so, use `C-g'
and repeat the current command to see the effect.

Here are screen shots of face-name candidates for `icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag':

`icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag' = `t':
[[image:IcicleWYSIWYGCompletionsflagWhole]]

`icicle-WYSIWYG-Completions-flag'= `4':

----
[:GnusBug]
[:icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag]
==== Option icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-unpropertize-completion-result-flag''''
means that `completing-read' and (starting with Emacs 23)
`read-file-name' will strip all text properties from the result they
return. Regardless of the option value, '''Icicles''' strips text properties
that it adds for its internal use.  See the doc string of function `icicle-unpropertize-completion' for more information about this.

The default value of the option is `nil'.  It is not likely that you
will need to change this, but you might if you use some other
library that cannot accept a propertized string as the result of
completion.

'''Note:''' This is the case if you use [[CategoryGnus|GNUS]] -- it has a known bug in
this regard (reported 2008-06-21).  It blindly prints the EmacsLisp
string that is the result of completion into an MML attribute
value: ##filename=#("~/.gnus/attach.el" 0 25 (face nil))##.  GNUS
should ensure that whatever it uses for an attribute value is
valid for MML (has normal ##"..."## string syntax, with acceptable
characters).  But it simply calls a Lisp print function, which
prints ###("...")##. See also GnusBugsAndWorkarounds.

[:icicle-guess-commands-in-path]
[:icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache]
==== Option icicle-guess-commands-in-path ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-guess-commands-in-path'''' means
that all executable files (or all files, if option `shell-completion-execonly' is `nil') in your search path are included among the completion candidates whenever a shell command is read.  The particular non-nil value determines when this list of commands is updated from your current search
path. The default value is `nil'.  (The computed commands are cached in '''`icicle-shell-command-candidates-cache''''.)
See [[Icicles - Shell-Command Enhancements#icicle-guess-commands-in-path|Icicles - Shell-Command Enhancements]].



----
[:icicle-quote-shell-file-name-flag]
==== Option icicle-quote-shell-file-name-flag ====

Non-`nil' option '''`icicle-quote-shell-file-name-flag'''' means that
`icicle-read-shell-command-completing' double-quotes the file
name at the beginning of the shell command it reads.  This
affects several Emacs commands, such as '''`##M-!##'''' that read a shell
command and its arguments.

If this is `nil', then such commands will not quote a shell-command file
name such as `##c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe##'.  In that case,
a shell such as `bash' fails for a shell command such as
`##c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &##', because it
interprets only `##c:/Program##' as the shell command.  That is, it
interprets the space (`SPC') characters in the file name as separators.

If this is non-`nil' (the default value), then input such as
`##c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe arg1 arg2 &##' is passed to the
shell as `##"c:/Program Files/My Dir/mycmd.exe" arg1 arg2 &##' (notice the double-quotes).

See the doc string of `icicle-quote-file-name-part-of-cmd' for
information about the characters that, like `SPC', lead to
file-name quoting.

[:icicle-inhibit-ding-flag]
==== Option icicle-inhibit-ding-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-inhibit-ding-flag'''' means '''Icicles'''
never uses an audible bell (ding).



----
[:icicle-option-type-prefix-arg-list]
==== Option icicle-option-type-prefix-arg-list ====

A list of [[symbol]]s that control prefix arguments for command `icicle-describe-option-of-type' (bound to `C-h C-o' by default). A list of six symbols taken from this list:

* `direct'           
* `inherit'            
* `inherit-or-value'
* `direct-or-value'   
* `inherit-or-regexp'   
* `direct-or-regexp'

Choose the order you like.  The list members map, in order from left to
right, to these prefix argument keys:

# `C-u C-u'           
# `C-0'            
# `C-u'
# `C-9' (positive)    
# no prefix arg    
# `C--' (negative)

For the meanings of the symbols, see the [[doc string]] of 
`icicle-describe-option-of-type', which describes the default
prefix-argument bindings for the command.

----
[:icicle-customize-save-flag]
==== Option icicle-customize-save-flag ====

Non-`nil' user option '''`icicle-customize-save-flag'''' means that
'''Icicles''' will save the updated value of option `<tt>[[#icicle-command-abbrev-alist]]</tt>' when you quit Emacs.  This is the
normal behavior.  If you for some reason do not want your
[[custom file]] or [[init file]] updated in this way, then customize
`icicle-customize-save-flag' to `nil'.


----
[:icicle-buffers-ido-like-flag]
==== Option icicle-buffers-ido-like-flag ====

If '''`icicle-buffers-ido-like-flag'''' is `t' then `icicle-buffer' and
similar commands act more [[Ido]]-like.  Specifically, those
commands then bind these options to `t':
* `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag'
* `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag'
* `icicle-default-value'



----
[:icicle-files-ido-like-flag]
==== Option icicle-files-ido-like-flag ====

If '''`icicle-files-ido-like-flag'''' is `t' then `icicle-file' and
similar commands act more [[Ido]]-like.  Specifically, those
commands then bind these options to `t':
* `icicle-show-Completions-initially-flag'
* `icicle-top-level-when-sole-completion-flag'
* `icicle-default-value'


----
[:icicle-customize-save-variable-function]
==== Option icicle-customize-save-variable-function ====

The value of option '''`icicle-customize-save-variable-function'''' is the function
'''Icicles''' uses to automatically save user option changes made by
some commands.  I recommend that you do '''''NOT''''' change this option
value.  This is provided only for users who might want to
disable such automatic saving of option changes, by setting this
to `ignore', or users who might want to manage such option
saving using their own function instead of the default value,
`customize-save-variable'.



----
[:icicle-zap-to-char-candidates]
==== Option icicle-zap-to-char-candidates ====

Option '''`icicle-zap-to-char-candidates'''' determines which
character names are used for `icicle-zap-to-char' (bound to
'''`M-z'''' by default) when completing.  The default value of `nil'
means complete against character names that you have already
entered.  You can instead set the value to '''`icicle-ucs-names'''' to
complete against all Unicode character names.  Or you can set it
to any function that returns a value of the same form at that
returned by `icicle-ucs-names' (hence `ucs-names').
