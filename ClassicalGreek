As of 2025, installing appropriate fonts for Classical Greek is easier than ever.

== ConTeXt ==

With the ancientgreek module, ConTeXt can process Unicode Greek input. I use the carbon (OS X) version of emacs (22.0.96.1), and I found it easy to write and display Unicode polytonic Greek. 

=== Writing polytonic Greek in Unicode ===

The most convenient method is greek-babel. Type ##C-\## When you're prompted for an Input method, type ##greek-babel##. This will allow you to type the same keystrokes as if you were inputting the babel transliteration, but emacs will translate them to the corresponding Unicode glyphs. Very neat!

=== Displaying polytonic Greek ===

This is code that I picked up here on the wiki. I like a very large font so I can recline in my chair while typing; just adapt the size if you like something smaller. It works on my copmuter: OS X 10.4.9, with the Gentium fonts installed. YMMV:

<pre>
(create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
   "-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-fontset-andale,
     ascii:-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-mac-roman" t 'noerror)
(set-frame-font "-apple-andale mono-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-m-*-fontset-andale" 'keep)

(set-fontset-font "fontset-andale"
		  (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x0374)
			(decode-char 'ucs #x03fb))
		  "-apple-gentiumalt-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1")

(set-fontset-font "fontset-andale"
		  (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x1f00)
			(decode-char 'ucs #x1fef))
		  "-apple-gentiumalt-medium-r-normal--24-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1")
</pre>
