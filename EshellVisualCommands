Eshell will use `ansi-term' automatically for specific commands, if you
just add them to `eshell-visual-commands'.

    (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "mutt")

If you get a 

     "eterm: unknown term type"

error message, that means you need the /usr/share/terminfo/e/eterm file on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, this file is part of the ncurses-term package.

How do we get editing in the visual commands?  I get a terminal to work with when I use <code>eshell-visual-commands</code>, but then I can't edit my input to the program (e.g., I see <code>^E</code> instead of moving the cursor to the end of line). Is there a way to get a more capable terminal?  Should we use rlwrap for the sub-program?

How to use eshell-visual-subcommands:
 
An alist of the form
<pre>
 ((COMMAND1 (SUBCOMMAND1 SUBCOMMAND2...))
  (COMMAND2 (SUBCOMMAND1 ...)))
</pre>
of commands with subcommands that present their output in a
visual fashion.  A likely entry is
<pre>
("git" ("log" "diff" "show"))
</pre>

This shows <code>git log</code> in an ANSI terminal.
