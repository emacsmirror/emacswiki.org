How to setup a complete IDE using python-mode.el was shown at EuroPython-2013 at Florence:

Get the latest release from:

* https://launchpad.net/python-mode

The relevant page also has installation instructions.  The following was enough for me, though:

* Add python-mode.el to the LoadPath.
* Add the following to your InitFile

 (autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python Mode." t)
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))
 (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("python" . python-mode))

this could be useful: (RichardRiley : why?)

Many distros add relevant autoloads e.g. Gentoo adds it to site-lisp/site-gentoo.el or possibly site-lisp/site-gentoo.d  

== Design ==
python-mode.el reduces number of needed keystrokes providing tailored commands. It makes edits faster, assists programming by speech, macro-driven input etc.

Support Python language features, for example:

py-up, py-down - travelling nested blocks

Avoid typos fetching forms at point, a clause for example:

py-backward-clause

py-copy-clause

py-down-clause

...

No need to customize when testing different versions:

py-execute-clause-python2

py-execute-clause-python3

py-execute-clause-ipython

...

- Notion of finer grained parts - py-expression, py-minor-expression

- Commands running versioned and paralleled (I)Python-executables, no need to re-define the default Python
    largely removing the need of an active region marked before, see py-execute-line and a whole bunch more

Have a look at the menu. Directory "doc" lists commands.


== some more commands ===

 (defun py-next-block ()
   "go to the next block.  Cf. `forward-sexp' for lisp-mode"
   (interactive)
   (py-mark-block nil 't)
   (back-to-indentation))

ElDoc works with the python mode in GNU Emacs 22.
(For Emacs 21, see the [http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/eldoc.el back-port] of Eldoc.)
To enable it by default in your python mode buffers, you might want something like:

   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
          '(lambda () (eldoc-mode 1)) t)

'py-help-at-point' can be used to get the internal python documentation on the function at point.

For Emacs 23: 
C-c C-f	"sys" -- this works, and describes the "sys" module in a separate Emacs help buffer.
: If I define function "zoot", help doesn't on it -- it's only for global things.

(Andreas Röhler: No: inside current buffer it jumps to definition, no need for a help buffer.)

== Integrating python-mode's pdbtrack with xpdb and making it aware of generator expressions ==

AlexCoventry

I have found the following settings helpful in using xpdb:

{{{
;; Let python-mode know about xpdb and generator expressions.
(setq py-pdbtrack-input-prompt "\n[(&amp;amp;amp;lt;]*x?pdb[&amp;amp;amp;gt;)]+ "
      py-pdbtrack-stack-entry-regexp
      (concat "^&amp;amp;amp;gt; \\(.*\\)(\\([0-9]+\\))"
	      "\\([?a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\|&amp;amp;amp;lt;genexpr&amp;amp;amp;gt;\\)()"))
}}}

xpdb is a fork of the standard library pdb, available here: https://code.launchpad.net/~eyal-lotem+launchpad/xpdb/main
