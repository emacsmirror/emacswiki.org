*iflipb* lets you flip between recently visited buffers in a way that
resembles what ##Alt-(Shift-)TAB## does in Microsoft Windows and other
graphical window managers. *iflipb* treats the buffer list as a stack,
and (by design) it doesn't wrap around. This means that when you have
flipped to the last buffer and continue, you don't get to the first
buffer again. This is a good thing. (If you disagree and want
wrap-around, set ##iflipb-wrap-around## to non-nil.)

== Operation ==

*iflipb* provides two commands: ##iflipb-next-buffer## and
##iflipb-previous-buffer##.

##iflipb-next-buffer## behaves like ##Alt-TAB##: it switches to the
previously used buffer, just like ##C-x b RET## (or ##C-M-l## in XEmacs).
However, another consecutive call to ##iflipb-next-buffer## switches to
the next buffer in the buffer list, and so on. When such a consecutive
call is made, the skipped-over buffer is not regarded as visited.

While flipping, the names of the most recent buffers are displayed in
the minibuffer, and the currently visited buffer is surrounded by square
brackets and marked with a bold face.

A key thing to notice here is that *iflipb* displays the buffer contents
after each step forward/backwards (in addition to displaying the buffer
names), unlike for instance the buffer switching model of
[[InteractivelyDoThings|ido-mode]] where only the buffer names are
displayed.

##iflipb-previous-buffer## behaves like ##Alt-Shift-TAB##: it walks
backwards in the buffer list.

Here is an illustration of what happens in a couple of different scenarios:

||'''//Scenario 1//''' ||*Minibuffer display*||*Actual buffer list*||

||                     ||                    ||                    ||
||'''//Scenario 3//''' ||*Minibuffer display*||*Actual buffer list*||
||*Original*           ||                    ||A B C D E           ||
||*Forward flip*       ||A [*B*] C D E       ||B A C D E           ||
||*Forward flip*       ||A B [*C*] D E       ||C A B D E           ||
||'''[Edit buffer C]'''||                    ||C A B D E           ||
||*Forward flip*       ||C [*A*] B D E       ||A C B D E           ||

*iflipb* by default ignores buffers whose names start with an asterix or
space. You can give a prefix argument to ##iflipb-next-buffer## to make it flip
between more buffers. See the documentation of the variables
##iflipb-ignore-buffers## and ##iflipb-always-ignore-buffers## for how to change
this.

== Installation ==

Direct link to ##iflipb.el##: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrosdahl/iflipb/master/iflipb.el

Source code repository: https://github.com/jrosdahl/iflipb

To load *iflipb*, store ##iflipb.el## in your Emacs load path and put

  (require 'iflipb)

in your ##.emacs## or equivalent.

This file does not install any key bindings for the two commands. I
personally use ##M-h## and ##M-H## (i.e., ##M-S-h##) since I don't use the
standard binding of ##M-h## (##mark-paragraph##) and ##M-h## is quick and easy
to press. To install *iflipb* with ##M-h## and ##M-H## as keyboard bindings,
put something like this in your ##.emacs##:

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-h") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-H") 'iflipb-previous-buffer)

Another alternative is to use ##C-tab## and ##C-S-tab##:

  (global-set-key (kbd "<C-tab>") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
  (global-set-key
   (if (featurep 'xemacs) (kbd "<C-iso-left-tab>") (kbd "<C-S-iso-lefttab>"))
   'iflipb-previous-buffer)

Or perhaps use functions keys like ##F9## and ##F10##:

  (global-set-key (kbd "<f10>") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>")  'iflipb-previous-buffer)

== About ==

*iflipb* was inspired by 
[http://kellyfelkins.org/pub/cycle-buffer.el cycle-buffer.el]. ##cycle-buffer.el## has
some more features, but doesn't quite behave like I want, so I
wrote my own simple replacement.

Have fun!

After several days of using other buffer switching packages, I've settled down on yours. Thanks. neat implementation.
Sometimes it would be more convenient if buffer switching action is stopped by timer(without inputing any command instead). 
For example, after pressing C-TAB, I'm frequently looking a buffer contents for a while... and then want to go back by just pressing another C-TAB.
Your original implementation need another command's to predicate whether last action is relevant to iflipb'ing or not. 

Heres' my customization for iflipb but please be noted that I'm not that good at elisp. 


  (when (my-try-require 'iflipb)
    ;; wrap is better?! trying..
    (setq iflipb-wrap-around t)
    ;; auto off function iflipb'ing
    (setq my-iflipb-auto-off-timeout-sec 1)
    (setq my-iflipb-auto-off-timer-canceler-internal nil)
    (setq my-iflipb-ing-internal nil)
    (defun my-iflipb-auto-off ()
  	(message nil)
  	(setq my-iflipb-auto-off-timer-canceler-internal nil
  		  my-iflipb-ing-internal nil)
  	)
    (defun my-iflipb-next-buffer (arg)
  	(interactive "P")
  	(iflipb-next-buffer arg)
  	(if my-iflipb-auto-off-timer-canceler-internal
  		(cancel-timer my-iflipb-auto-off-timer-canceler-internal))
  	(run-with-idle-timer my-iflipb-auto-off-timeout-sec 0 'my-iflipb-auto-off)

    (global-set-key (kbd "<C-tab>") 'my-iflipb-next-buffer)
    (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-tab>") 'my-iflipb-previous-buffer)
    (defun iflipb-first-iflipb-buffer-switch-command ()
  	"Determines whether this is the first invocation of
  iflipb-next-buffer or iflipb-previous-buffer this round."
  	(not (and (or (eq last-command 'my-iflipb-next-buffer)
  				  (eq last-command 'my-iflipb-previous-buffer))
  			  my-iflipb-ing-internal)))
    )
