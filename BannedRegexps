# This page lists regular expressions that prevent the saving of a page.
# The regexps are matched against any page or comment submitted.
# The format is simple: # comments to the end of the line. Empty lines are ignored.
# Everything else is a regular expression. If the regular expression is followed by
# a comment, this is used as the explanation when a user is denied editing. If the
# comment starts with a date, this date is not included in the explanation.
# The date could help us decide which regular expressions to delete in the future.
# If the regular expression contains a group, the first group will be add to the
# explanation.
# In other words:
# ^\s*([^#]+?)\s*(#\s*(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\s*)?(.*))?$
# Group 1 is the regular expression to use.
# Group 4 is the explanation to use.
