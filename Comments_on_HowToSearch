I've started messing with the search engine again and I'm trying to limit results to URLs matching ##www.emacswiki.org/emacs##. Let's hope it works. If you notice any irregularities, please comment.

I'm seeing it on the bottom of every page (Firefox and Chrome). Plus a "language" input?

The other day, while I was at work, my sister 
stole my apple ipad and tested to see if itt ccan survive a 25 foot drop, just so she can be a youutube sensation. 
My appl ipad is now broken and shhe has 83 views. I know this is 
completely off topic but I had to share it with someone!
