It can still be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20210416115342/https://muto.ca/posts/actually-using-emacs-rmail.html.

I have added the above web archive link as an alternative to Muto's rmail article. Hope that helps.

This code was the original solution to "Decoding Non ASCII mail in Rmail". Since ##rmail-message-filter## has since been removed, I've replaced this code in the main article with an *untested* replacement (look I'm lazy. I'll make sure it works soon)

<pre>
(autoload 'rfc2047-decode-string "rfc2047")
(autoload 'rfc2047-decode-region "rfc2047")
(setq rmail-message-filter
      (lambda ()
        (save-excursion
          (when (search-forward "\n\n" nil t)
            (rfc2047-decode-region
              (point-min) (match-beginning 0)))))
      rmail-summary-line-decoder
      (function rfc2047-decode-string))
</pre>

Also yes, my old website *muto.ca* is gone. I was poor for a while and couldn't afford it, haha!

I no longer update it, but I keep a [[https://mutoshack.gitlab.io/ static version up on Gitlab]]
