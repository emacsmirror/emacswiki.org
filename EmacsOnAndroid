This is about installing Emacs into an Android device. 
See GoogleAndroid for tips about using Emacs to develop Android applications.

==Ways to run Emacs on Android devices==

===FSF GUI port===

A port of Emacs to Android as a GUI application is available in Emacs 30.1.

This port features extensive support for touch screen input and on-screen keyboards, coupled with accessing storage devices mounted through "content providers" via the Storage Access Framework, and a plenitude of other features.
 
Regularly updated prebuilts of both development snapshots and releases are available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs

F-Droid also provides prebuilts, but they are at times outdated, and do not work on older systems.

===Modifier Bar===
Don't forget to enable modifier bar via (modifier-bar-mode), if you find menu bars and tool bars cubersome.

You can use (tool-bar-position 'bottom) to adjust its position.
You need to enable tool bar for modifier bar to work.

===Always show soft keyboard===
In some cases, such as the agenda dispatcher, the buffer is read-only, but the query still depends on a key press.  In this case, the default behavior is to hide the soft keyboard.

You can set (touch-screen-display-keyboard t) to avoid this pitfall.
===Disable text conversion===
In order to support features such as auto-correct, auto-complete, input characters are not directly processed by native android emacs.  Rather, a text conversion is performed.

This is helpful if you rely on Android to input complex text.  However, if you wish to use emacs built-in input methods, you need to disable the conversion by setting (overriding-text-conversion-style nil).

See also the function set-text-conversion-style.
===Emacs within a GNU/Linux chroot===
Emacs on Android, without requiring root or special setup, can be installed in a chroot environment such as provided by [https://userland.tech/ UserLand] which can even give an optional desktop environment. 

With UserLand, you can install a variety of different distributions. 
Here are some of the commands to install emacs on some of them: 

Another solution is [https://termux.com Termux]. There, just Debian is supported. 

In Alpine (recommended)

[code]apk update && apk add emacs[/code]

In Arch Linux

[code]pacman -Syu && pacman -S emacs[/code]

In Debian/Ubuntu

[code]apt update && apt install emacs[/code]

===Run Linux inside a jail===
====GNU/Linux in a chroot jail (requires root)====
For a Linux and Emacs environment in a chrooted loopback filesystem on a rooted tablet, see [http://www.carcosa.net/jason/blog/2012/Jul/19 Running Emacs on an Android tablet]. Android apps such as ConnectBot shell client and Hacker's Keyboard (including Ctrl, etc. keys) can be used with Emacs in this way.

==Caps Lock as Ctrl and Sticky Keys==
Useful if you are using an external physical keyboard.  See [[StickyModifiersAndroid]]
