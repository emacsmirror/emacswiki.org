This is about installing Emacs into an Android device. 
See GoogleAndroid for tips about using Emacs to develop Android applications.

==Ways to run Emacs on Android devices==

===Real native port===

The feature/android branch of the Emacs git repository contains the source code of a real port to Android, complete with touch screen and on screen keyboard support.
Prebuilt binaries are available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs

F-Droid also provides pre-builts, but they are usually outdated, have less dependencies included, and do not work on older systems.

===Native port (installable Android application)===
A native Emacs on Android, without requiring root or special setup, can be installed in a chroot environment such as provided by [https://userland.tech/ UserLand] which can even give an optional desktop environment. 

With UserLand, you can install a variety of different distributions. 
Here are some of the commands to install emacs on some of them: 

Another solution is [https://termux.com Termux]. There, just Debian is supported. 

In Alpine (recommended)

[code]apk update && apk add emacs[/code]

In Arch Linux

[code]pacman -Syu && pacman -S emacs[/code]

In Debian/Ubuntu

[code]apt update && apt install emacs[/code]

===Run Linux inside a jail===
====GNU/Linux in a chroot jail (requires root)====
For a Linux and Emacs environment in a chrooted loopback filesystem on a rooted tablet, see [http://www.carcosa.net/jason/blog/2012/Jul/19 Running Emacs on an Android tablet]. Android apps such as ConnectBot shell client and Hacker's Keyboard (including Ctrl, etc. keys) can be used with Emacs in this way.


===Don't run Emacs, use a SSH client to connect to a server which runs Emacs===
This is by far the easiest and fastest way. It does not require uninstalling Android, and Emacs will run at normal speed. You could also use VNC if you need graphics.
