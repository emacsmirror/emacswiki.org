This is about installing Emacs into an Android device. 
See GoogleAndroid for tips about using Emacs to develop Android applications.

==Ways to run Emacs on Android devices==

===FSF GUI port===

A port of Emacs to Android as a GUI application will constitute part of the upcoming Emacs 30.1 release, and is already present within the Emacs Git repository.

This port features extensive support for touch screen input and on-screen keyboards, coupled with accessing storage devices mounted through "content providers" via the Storage Access Framework, and a plenitude of other features.
 
Regularly updated prebuilt snapshots of the in-development source code are available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs

F-Droid also provides prebuilts, but they are outdated, have fewer dependencies bundled, and do not work on older systems.

===Emacs within a GNU/Linux chroot===
Emacs on Android, without requiring root or special setup, can be installed in a chroot environment such as provided by [https://userland.tech/ UserLand] which can even give an optional desktop environment. 

With UserLand, you can install a variety of different distributions. 
Here are some of the commands to install emacs on some of them: 

Another solution is [https://termux.com Termux]. There, just Debian is supported. 

In Alpine (recommended)

[code]apk update && apk add emacs[/code]

In Arch Linux

[code]pacman -Syu && pacman -S emacs[/code]

In Debian/Ubuntu

[code]apt update && apt install emacs[/code]

===Run Linux inside a jail===
====GNU/Linux in a chroot jail (requires root)====
For a Linux and Emacs environment in a chrooted loopback filesystem on a rooted tablet, see [http://www.carcosa.net/jason/blog/2012/Jul/19 Running Emacs on an Android tablet]. Android apps such as ConnectBot shell client and Hacker's Keyboard (including Ctrl, etc. keys) can be used with Emacs in this way.
