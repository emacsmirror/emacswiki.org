This is about installing Emacs into an Android device. See GoogleAndroid for tips about using Emacs to develop Android applications.

== Introduction: ways to run Emacs on Android devices ==
Some of them are hypothetical.

===Native port (installable Android application)===
A first version of a native port was released August 2012. Quickly installable like any other Android app, with no need to root the mobile device. Key bindings, etc., work with physical keyboards -e.g. mini bluetooth keyboard- and External Keyboard Helper Pro app, or with on-screen Hacker's Keyboard app. Init file: ##/sdcard/emacs/.emacs## (optional). See [http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zielm.emacs Google Play: Emacs], and [http://github.com/zielmicha/emacs-android GitHub: zielmicha/emacs-android] (Emacs port [http://github.com/zielmicha/emacs-android/issues issues], etc.).

I've tried recently using the Emacs app from the Play Store, but the software couldn't be downloaded because http://emacs.zielm.com/ can't be resolved.

Anyway, even if that app is gone (or it doesn't meet our standards for free and open-source software because its compilation can't be easily reproduced from sources, as stated by by the F-Droid team), compiling Emacs against the Android environment (to get the paths correct for an app, and correct library links) and running it from inside a nice terminal in Android must be no big conceptual problem. So someone else might try to do this eventually to get an Emacs working even in an unrooted Android.

===Keep Android, install Linux and Emacs in a jail, run Emacs from an Android shell client===
====GNU/Linux in a chroot jail (requires root)====
For a Linux and Emacs environment in a chrooted loopback filesystem on a rooted tablet, see [http://www.carcosa.net/jason/blog/2012/Jul/19 Running Emacs on an Android tablet]. Android apps such as ConnectBot shell client and Hacker's Keyboard (including Ctrl, etc. keys) can be used with Emacs in this way.

====GNU/Linux in a ptrace-based container (doesn't require root!)====
As for a rooted Android, it has been long known that it is possible to install a GNU/Linux distro into a chroot (as described above).

But it's also interesting to get a running Emacs from a ready GNU/Linux distro package in an unrooted Android -- as a faster solution compared to the native app option, which would require some work on adapting and recompiling Emacs against the Android environment.

And it's possible with the GNURoot app (with GNURoot Wheezy, for example)! It allows to use a GNU/Linux distro like Debian in an unrooted Android. There I could start Emacs, as well as ssh to my computers, and hopefully I'll be able to use TRAMP, too. (I haven't yet tried this out.)

The GNURoot app does all this by means of a [http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/9188/4319 "PTRACE container"] implemented by [http://proot.me/ "proot"]: interception of syscalls and "emulating" what should be done in the different Android and unprivileged environment. (Redirecting paths, faking the root user privileges, etc.)

[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/proot_me/h3rDV8na9kc/4mSCyOsX28UJ It was a while ago when I learned about such projects].

It's a pity that [https://github.com/corbinlc/gnuroot the source code for GNURoot] seems not to be well documented, so it's not easy to start hacking with it right away or at least learn how all the things have been compiled and put together from source.

===Remove Android, install another GNU/Linux, install Emacs there===
This is known to work, but you need to get root access to your tablet and remove Android.
See below for some experiences with particular tablets.

===Don't run Emacs, just use a SSH client to connect to a server which runs Emacs===
This is by far the easiest and fastest way. It does not require uninstalling Android, and Emacs will run at normal speed.

You could also use VNC if you need graphics.
===Or evenâ¦ use other programmer editor, and simulate Emacs behaviour there===
There are libre editors which can be extended to use Emacs key bindings, for instance:

==Installing Debian/Ubuntu and Emacs on G1/G2 phone==

There is a lot of online information for hacking HTC mobile phones on the [http://www.xda-developers.com/ xda-developers website].
This includes the G1 and G2 google phones.
One of these hacks is to get a full distribution such as Debian or Ubuntu running, on which you can then install Emacs :)

Check out the [http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=HTC_Dream wiki] to get an overview of hacking the G1, and how to flash the ROM etc.

First you need to [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=442480 root] your phone.

Then you can update your ROM to a newer version. There are lots of different ROM updates available [http://www.androidspin.com/ here]. I recommend installing [http://jf.odiness.com/ JesusFreke's ROMs] initially, and then upgrading to the latest stable cyanogen ROM. If you make an ext2/3 partition on your SD card, then when you install the [http://www.cyanogenmod.com/downloads cyanogen ROM] it will apply Apps2SD which allows you to install many more apps than normal. I also recommend using [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=523558 cyanogen's recovery image] (which allows you to easily backup your phone).
You will also need to install the latest radio image available [http://www.htc.com/www/support/android/adp.html here].

Read how to install new images and updates [http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=HTC_Dream_overview_and_useful_information#Updatingx20.thex20.ROM here].

Then have a look at these simple [http://www.androidfanatic.com/cms/community-forums.html?func=view&catid=9&id=2248 instructions] on installing Debian (Note: you may need to alter the installer.sh script as mentioned in post #3566 [http://www.androidfanatic.com/cms/community-forums.html?func=view&amp;catid=9&amp;id=2248&amp;start=60#3566 here]).

If you like it a little less "simple" and more solid, I'd rather recommend Bayle Shank's instructions on installing debian into an ext partition by hand [http://bayleshanks.com/wiki.pl?tips-computer-android-g1 here], as parts of that installer are really bogus. In that case you'll also have to enable compcache by hand, which Bayle Shank's script doesn't do, so you just paste his script into the "custom_shells" section of the user.conf obtained from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=542899]. Also you might want to use a non-root user for your emacs work, in that case [http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=Debian_on_G1#Sockets_for_non-root_users:] will help. -- TauPan

Once you have Debian installed you can just "apt-get emacs" to install emacs 22.

To install Ubuntu instead, see [http://xdatap1.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/jaunty-under-android/ here].  He provides downloads for prebuilt Jaunty (9.04) images which makes it very easy to set up.  Again it's a simple matter to install emacs via apt-get.

I strongly recommend using [http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/ ConnectBot] in local mode as the terminal emulator, since it preserves the running terminal session even when you switch away to other apps and back, and also has some extremely convenient keybindings and many other great features -- AdamSpiers

Here are some [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/17033 useful thoughts on reducing emacs' footprint] for low-powered devices.

== Using emacs for making calls and sending texts ==

To access the android api from emacs you need to first install the android scripting environment which you can get [http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/downloads/list here] (see [http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/google-android/articles/37151.aspx here] for how to install apk files).
Then get it working in your Debian installation: see [http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=3957997#post3957997 here]

=== Making phone calls ===
With this recipe you can make phone calls from your [BbdbMode bbdb buffer]:
# Make sure you have the android scripting environment installed and working in your Debian installation (see previously mentioned links)
# Save the following python code to 'dialnumber.py' and save it to '/root/android/' in your Debian installation (you will need to create this directory):

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import android
    import sys
    droid = android.Android()
    droid.callNumber(sys.argv[1])
# You can now use the following function from the bbdb buffer to call the phone number of the record at point (but you must have an ASE shell terminal running on Android):

    (defun joebloggs/bbdb-android-dial (phone force-area-code)
      "Dial the number at point.
    If the point is at the beginning of a record, dial the first
    phone number.  Does not dial the extension.  Does not apply the
    transformations from bbdb-dial-local-prefix-alist if a prefix arg
    is given."
      (interactive (list (bbdb-current-field)
                 current-prefix-arg))
      (if (eq (car-safe phone) 'name)
          (setq phone (car (bbdb-record-phones (bbdb-current-record)))))
      (if (eq (car-safe phone) 'phone)
          (setq phone (car (cdr phone))))
      (or (vectorp phone) (error "not on a phone field"))

      (let* ((number (bbdb-phone-string phone)) shortnumber)
        (when (not force-area-code)
          (let ((alist bbdb-dial-local-prefix-alist))
        (while alist
          (if (string-match (concat "^" (eval (caar alist))) number)
              (setq shortnumber (concat (car (cdar alist))
                        (substring number (match-end 0)))
                alist nil))
          (setq alist (cdr alist)))))

        ;; cut off the extension
        (if (string-match "x[0-9]+$" number)
        (setq number (substring number 0 (match-beginning 0))))

        ;; This is terrifically Americanized...
        ;; Leading 0 => local number (?)
        (if (and (not shortnumber) bbdb-dial-local-prefix
             (string-match "^0" number))
        (setq number (concat bbdb-dial-local-prefix number)))

        ;; Leading + => long distance/international number
        (if (and (not shortnumber) bbdb-dial-long-distance-prefix
             (string-match "^\+" number))
        (setq number (concat bbdb-dial-long-distance-prefix " "
                     (substring number 1))))

        ;; use the short number if it's available
        (setq number (or shortnumber number))
        (if (not bbdb-silent-running)
        (message "Dialing %s" number))
        (shell-command (concat "export AP_PORT=$(netstat -napt|sed -n 's/^tcp.*127.0.0.1:\\([0-9]*\\).*LISTEN.*ase$/\\1/gp');/root/android/dialnumber.py " number))))

=== Sending SMS text messages ===
With this recipe you can send text messages from emacs:
# Make sure you have the android scripting environment installed and working in your Debian installation (see previously mentioned links)
# Save the following python code to 'sendtext.py' and save it to '/root/android/' in your Debian installation:

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import android
    import sys
    droid = android.Android()
    droid.sendTextMessage(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

# install Lisp:sms.el and read the instructions
# if you want to use your [CategoryBbdb BBDB] with [[sms.el]] install Lisp:bbdb-sms.el and read the instructions
