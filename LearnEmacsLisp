EmacsLisp (Elisp) is the language that much of Emacs is written in, and it is also the language that you can use to [[customize]] Emacs for your own use.

Don't worry - even if you're an EmacsNewbie, you can get the hang of it. Learning a little Emacs Lisp will help you use Emacs more effectively:

* You will better understand the documentation and online help for functions and variables.
* You will be able to consult the Lisp source code for a function or variable, in order to understand it still better.
* You will be able to convert common [[key sequence]]s you use into [[keyboard macro]]s or your own [[command]]s defined in Lisp.
* You will be able to take snippets of code from the standard source code or elsewhere and adapt them to create your own Emacs commands.
* You will be able to attract better guidance (and/or commiseration) from fellow Emacs users.
* You will be able to make Emacs better fit your needs and fancies.


== Emacs Lisp for things you already use ==

* Use `C-x ESC ESC' (`repeat-complex-command') to repeat [[command]]s you execute, and look at the Emacs Lisp code that executes them, before hitting `RET' (Return) -- see RepeatLastCommand.  You can edit that code to get a variation on the last behavior.

* Use `C-h f' (`describe-function') and `C-h v' (`describe-variable') to understand commands and [[variable]]s you use. You'll see a description of the function or variable. If you have the Emacs source code locally, you will also see a link to the relevant definition in the code. Click the link or move the [[cursor]] to it and press `RET' to follow it.

* Use `C-h k' (`describe-key') to see which command is invoked when you use a [[key]]. The description shown includes the command description (see previous).

== Resources ==

* Read the ''Emacs Lisp Introduction'': EmacsLispIntro. Use `C-h i' (`info'), then choose `Emacs Lisp Intro'.  You can also read this manual [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html on the Web]] or as a portable [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/el-intro epub book]].
* Read the ''Emacs Lisp Reference'' manual: EmacsLispReference. Use `C-h i' (`info'), then choose `Elisp'. You can also read this manual [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html on the Web]] or as a portable [[https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/refer-el epub book]].

== General Lisp Resources ==

Emacs Lisp belong to the Lisp family (WikiPedia:Lisp_programming_language), and learning it will teach you Lisp concepts, as well as learning Lisp concepts will help you with Emacs Lisp.
