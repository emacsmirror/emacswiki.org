=Introduction=

Circe is yet another '''C'''lient for '''IRC''' in '''E'''macs

Its homepage is at http://www.jorgenschaefer.de/software/circe/.

[new]
I love the lui interface stuff. This is just what I was looking for for a long time now.

I will use it for my current project instead on reinventing the wheel again.

=Installation=

==On Gentoo GNU/Linux==

There's an ebuild which checks out the current sources from CVS and installs them, so it's simply a matter of

<pre>
$ ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge app-emacs/circe-cvs
</pre>

This ebuild installs a site file, too, so you don't have anything to do and circe is instantly available in your emacs (after a restart). To update circe, re-emerge circe-cvs.

==Any other system==

First copy the sources to some directory:
<pre>
cd ~/some/dir/
git clone git://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe.git circe
</pre>

Then add this directory to your emacs load-path and autoload circe by putting this into your ~/.emacs:
<pre>
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/dir/circe/lisp")
(autoload 'circe "circe" "Connect to an IRC server" t)
</pre>

To update the sources do
<pre>
cd ~/some/dir/circe/
git pull
</pre>

= Configuration =

For a sample configuration have a look at the info documentation (info "(circe)Example Configuration") or its [http://www.jorgenschaefer.de/software/circe/ homepage].
