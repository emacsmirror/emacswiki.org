Some [[Lisp]] dialects, such as Scheme and EuLisp, are Lisp1's, which
means symbols have a single binding that you can establish with `let'.
In such a Lisp, the following code locally binds the `add-one' function:

 (let ((add-one (lambda (x)
                  (+ 1 x))))
   (add-one 1))
 => 2

Many Lisp dialects are Lisp2's, including MacLisp (Elisp's ancestor),
CommonLisp, ISLISP, and EmacsLisp itself.  In these dialects, variables
have one binding for values, and another for functions.  The above code
does not work as intended in a Lisp2.

To bind the function cell of a variable, `flet' works analagously to
how `let' works for the value cell.  Note that `flet' comes from the
`cl' package, which is not active by default.

 (require 'cl)
 (flet ((add-one (x)
          (+ 1 x)))
   (let ((a 1))
     (add-one a)))
 => 2

Note that the body of a function defined using `flet' cannot be
recursive: it gets the previous binding of the function.  For
recursive functions, you must use `labels':

 (require 'cl)
 (labels ((add-positive-integers (a b)
            (cond
              ((= a 0) b)
              (t (add-positive-integers (- a 1) (+ b 1))))))
   (add-positive-integers 6 4))
 => 10

Actually, if you are really sneaky, you *can* do recursion with
flet as well.  The following would look nicer in a Lisp1 dialect,
since then the function cell access would not need `function' and
the function use could omit `funcall'.

 (require 'cl)
 (flet ((recurse (f a b)
          (cond
	    ((= a 0) b)
	    (t (funcall f f (- a 1) (+ b 1)))))
        (add-positive-integers (a b) (recurse (function recurse) a b)))
   (add-positive-integers 6 4))
 => 10

If you don't want your users to fall back on such evil hackery, write
libraries the other way around: If the function in question should be
variable, use this idiom instead:

Declare a variable which holds the functions to use:

    (defvar my-error-function 'error)

Later, funcall the variable instead of calling the function directly:

    (funcall my-error-function "This is an error message")
