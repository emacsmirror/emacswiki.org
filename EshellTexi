@end ifinfo

@c auto-extracted text follows, scanned by texidoc.el

Eshell is a command shell implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp.  It
invokes no external processes beyond those requested by the user.  It
is intended to be a functional replacement for command shells such as
bash, zsh, rc, 4dos; since Emacs itself is capable of handling most of
the tasks accomplished by such tools.

@section What does Eshell offer you?

Despite the sheer fact that running an Emacs shell can be fun, here
are a few of the unique features offered by Eshell:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Integration with the Emacs Lisp programming environment

@item
A high degree of configurability

@item
The ability to have the same shell on every system Emacs has been
ported to. Since Eshell imposes no external requirements, and
relies upon only the Lisp functions exposed by Emacs, it is quite
operating system independent. Several of the common UNIX
commands, such as ls, mv, rm, ln, etc., have been implemented in
Lisp in order to provide a more consistent work environment.
@end itemize


For those who might be using an older version of Eshell, version
2.1 represents an entirely new, module-based architecture. It
supports most of the features offered by modern shells. Here is a
brief list of some of its more visible features:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Command argument completion (tcsh, zsh)
@item
Input history management (bash)
@item
Intelligent output scrolling
@item
Psuedo-devices (such as ``/dev/clip'' for copying to the clipboard)
@item
Extended globbing (zsh)
@item
Argument and globbing predication (zsh)
@item
I/O redirection to buffers, files, symbols, processes, etc.
@item
Many niceties otherwise seen only in 4DOS
@item
Alias functions, both Lisp and Eshell-syntax
@item
Piping, sequenced commands, background jobs, etc@enddots{}

@node Supported versions of Emacs, Known problems, What does Eshell offer you?, The Emacs shell
@section Supported versions of Emacs

Eshell was designed to run on Emacs 20.4 or higher, and XEmacs 21.1
or higher.  It was tested on GNU/Linux, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows
2000.


@node Known problems, Downloading the latest version, Supported versions of Emacs, The Emacs shell
@section Known problems

If you try to run Eshell on other versions of Emacs, here are some
common problems you may run into, and how to overcome them:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Emacs 20.3: Pcomplete fails to byte compile.  Instead of typing
``make install'' in the Pcomplete directory, type: ``make
pcmpl-auto.el install_el''.  Then, copy the file ``pcmpl-auto.el''
into the directory that pcomplete was just installed into.  Why
this is failing is a mystery to me.  It appears that
byte-compiling pcomplete from a running Emacs session works just
fine.

@node Philosophy, Influences, How to begin, The Emacs shell
@section Philosophy

A shell is a layer which metaphorically surrounds the kernel, or
heart of an operating system.  This kernel can be seen as an engine
of pure functionality, waiting to serve, while the user programs
take advantage of that functionality to accomplish their purpose.

The shell's role is to make that functionality accessible to the
user in an unformed state.  Very roughly, it associates kernel
functionality with textual commands, allowing the user to interact
with the operating system via linguistic constructs.  Process
invocation is perhaps the most significant form this takes, using
the kernel's @code{fork} and @code{exec} functions.

Other programs also interact with the functionality of the kernel,
but these user applications typically offer a specific range of
functionality, and thus are not classed as "shells" proper.
(What they lose in quiddity, they gain in rigidity).

Emacs is also a user application, but it does make the
functionality of the kernel accessible through an interpreted
language---namely, Lisp.  For that reason, there is little
preventing Emacs from serving the same role as a modern shell.  It
too can manipulate the kernel in an unpredetermined way to cause
system changes.  All it's missing is the shell-ish linguistic
model.

Enter Eshell.  Eshell translates "shell-like" syntax into Lisp
in order to exercise the kernel in the same manner as typical
system shells.  There is a fundamental difference here, however,
although it may seem subtle at first@enddots{}

Shells like csh and Bourne shell were written several decades ago,
in different times, under more restrictive circumstances.  This
confined perspective shows itself in the paradigm used by nearly
all command-line shells since.  They are linear in conception, byte
stream-based, sequential, and confined to movement within a single
host machine.

Emacs, on the other hand, is more than just a limited translator
that can invoke subprocesses and redirect file handles.  It also
manages character buffers, windowing frames, network connections,
registers, bookmarks, processes, etc.  In other words, it's a very
multi-dimensional environment, within which eshell emulates a highly
linear methodology.

Taking a moment, let's look at how this could affect the future of
a shell allowed to develop in such a wider field of play:

@itemize @bullet
@item
There is no reason why directory movement should be linear, and
confined to a single file-system.  Emacs, through w3 and ange-ftp,
has access to the entire Web.  Why not allow a user to cd to
multiple directories simultaneously, for example?  It might make
some tasks easier, such as diff'ing files separated by very long
pathnames.

@item
Data sources are available from anywhere Emacs can derive
information from: not just from files or the output of other
processes.

@item
Multiple shell invocations all share the same environment---even
the same process list!  It would be possible to have "process
views", so that one buffer is watching standard output, another
standard error, and another the result of standard output grep'd
through a regular expression@enddots{}

@item
It is not necessary to "leave" the shell, losing all input and
output history, environment variables, directory stack, etc.
Emacs could save the contents of your eshell environment, and
restore all of it (or at least as much as possible) each time you
restart.  This could occur automatically, without requiring
complex initialization scripts.

@item
Typos occur all of the time; many of them are repeats of common
errors, such as @samp{dri} for @code{dir}.  Since executing non-existent
programs is rarely the intention of the user, eshell could prompt
for the replacement string, and then record that in a database of
known misspellings. (Note: The typo at the beginning of this
paragraph wasn't discovered until two months after I wrote the
text; it was not intentional).

@item
Emacs' register and bookmarking facilities can be used for
remembering where you've been, and what you've seen---to varying
levels of persistence.  They could perhaps even be tied to
specific "moments" during eshell execution, which would include
the environment at that time, as well as other variables.
Although this would require functionality orthogonal to Emacs'
own bookmarking facilities, the interface used could be made to
operate very similarly.
@end itemize


This presents a brief idea of what the fuller dimensionality of an
Emacs shell could offer.  It's not just the language of a shell
that determines how it's used, but also the Weltanschauung
underlying its design---and which is felt behind even the smallest
feature.  I would hope the freedom provided by using Emacs as a
parent environment will invite rich ideas from others.  It
certainly feels as though all I've done so far is to tie down the
horse, so to speak, so that he will run at a man's pace.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-buffer-name
The basename used for Eshell buffers.

@node Running Eshell, Reporting bugs, User Options, The Emacs shell
@section Running Eshell

There are only three commands used to invoke Eshell.  The first two
are intended for interactive use, while the third is meant for
programmers.  They are:

@deffn {Command} eshell &optional @var{arg}
Create an interactive Eshell buffer.
The buffer used for Eshell sessions is determined by the value of
@code{eshell-buffer-name}.  If there is already an Eshell session active in
that buffer, Emacs will simply switch to it.  Otherwise, a new session
will begin.  A new session is always created if the the prefix
argument ARG is specified.  Returns the buffer selected (or created).
@end deffn


@deffn {Command} eshell-command @var{command} &optional @var{arg}
Execute the Eshell command string COMMAND.
With prefix ARG, insert output into the current buffer at point.
@end deffn


@deffn {Command} eshell-command-result @var{command} &optional @var{status-var}
Execute the given Eshell COMMAND, and return the result.
The result might be any Lisp object.
If STATUS-VAR is a symbol, it will be set to the exit status of the
command.  This is the only way to determine whether the value returned
corresponding to a successful execution.
@end deffn


@node Reporting bugs,  , Running Eshell, The Emacs shell
@section Reporting bugs

Since Eshell has not yet been in use by a wide audience, and since
the number of possible configurations is quite large, it is certain
that many bugs slipped past the rigors of testing it was put
through.  If you do encounter a bug, on any system, please report
it---in addition to any particular oddities in your configuration
---so that the problem may be corrected for the benefit of others.

@deffn {Command} eshell-report-bug @var{topic}
Report a bug in Eshell.
Prompts for the TOPIC.  Leaves you in a mail buffer.
Please include any configuration details that might be involved.
@end deffn

@node Argument parsing, Command invocation, The Emacs shell, Top
@chapter Argument parsing

Argument parsing involves transforming the arguments passed on the
command line into equivalent Lisp forms that, when evaluated, will
yield the values intended.

Parsing of arguments can be extended by adding functions to the
hook @code{eshell-parse-argument-hook}.  For a good example of this, see
@code{eshell-parse-drive-letter}, defined in eshell-dirs.el.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-parse-argument-hook
Define how to process Eshell command line arguments.
When each function on this hook is called, point will be at the
current position within the argument list.  The function should either
return nil, meaning that it did no argument parsing, or it should
return the result of the parse as a sexp.  It is also responsible for
moving the point forward to reflect the amount of input text that was
parsed.

If no function handles the current character at point, it will be
treated as a literal character.
@end defvr

@node Command invocation, External commands, Argument parsing, Top

Executing an Eshell command is as simple as typing it in and
pressing @kbd{RET}.  There are several different kinds of commands,
however.

* Invoking Lisp functions::

@end menu

@node Invoking external commands, Invoking Lisp functions, Command invocation, Command invocation
@section Invoking external commands

External commands cause processes to be created, by loading
external executables into memory.  This is what most normal shells
do, most of the time.  For more information, see @ref{External commands}.


@node Invoking Lisp functions, Alias functions, Invoking external commands, Command invocation
@section Invoking Lisp functions

A Lisp function can be invoked using Lisp syntax, or command shell
syntax.  For example, to run @code{dired} to edit the current directory:

@example
/tmp $ (dired ".")
@end example

Or:

@example
/tmp $ dired .
@end example

The latter form is preferable, but the former is more precise,
since it involves no translations.  See @ref{Argument parsing}, to
learn more about how arguments are transformed before passing them
to commands.

Ordinarily, if @samp{dired} were also available as an external command,
the external version would be called in preference to any Lisp
function of the same name.  To change this behavior so that Lisp
functions always take precedence, set
@code{eshell-prefer-lisp-functions} to t.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-prefer-lisp-functions
If non-nil, prefer Lisp functions to external commands.
@end defvr


@node Alias functions, Lisp arguments, Invoking Lisp functions, Command invocation
@section Alias functions

Whenever a command is specified using a simple name, such as @samp{ls},
Eshell will first look for a Lisp function of the name @code{eshell/ls}.
If it exists, it will be called in preference to any other command
which might have matched the name @samp{ls} (such as command aliases,
external commands, Lisp functions of that name, etc).

This is the most flexible mechanism for creating new commands,
since it does not pollute the global namespace, yet allows you to
use all of Lisp's facilities to define that piece of functionality.
Most of Eshell's ``builtin'' commands are defined as alias functions.


@node Lisp arguments, Command hooks, Alias functions, Command invocation
@section Lisp arguments

It is possible to invoke a Lisp form as an argument.  This can be
done either by specifying the form as you might in Lisp, or by
using the @samp{$} character to introduce a value-interpolation:

@example
echo (+ 1 2)
@end example

Or

@example
echo $(+ 1 2)
@end example

The two forms are equivalent.  The second is required only if the
form being interpolated is within a string, or is a subexpression
of a larger argument:

@example
echo x$(+ 1 2) "String $(+ 1 2)"
@end example

To pass a Lisp symbol as a argument, use the alternate quoting
syntax, since the single quote character is far too overused in
shell syntax:

@example
echo #'lisp-symbol
@end example

Backquote can also be used:

@example
echo `(list ,lisp-symbol)
@end example

Lisp arguments are identified using the following regexp:

@defvr {User Option} eshell-lisp-regexp
A regexp which, if matched at beginning of an argument, means Lisp.
Such arguments will be passed to @code{read}, and then evaluated.
@end defvr


@node Command hooks,  , Lisp arguments, Command invocation
@section Command hooks

There are several hooks involved with command execution, which can
be used either to change or augment Eshell's behavior.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-pre-command-hook
A hook run before each interactive command is invoked.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-post-command-hook
A hook run after each interactive command is invoked.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-prepare-command-hook
A set of functions called to prepare a named command.
The command name and its argument are in @code{eshell-last-command-name}
and @code{eshell-last-arguments}.  The functions on this hook can change
the value of these symbols if necessary.

To prevent a command from executing at all, set
@code{eshell-last-command-name} to nil.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-named-command-hook
A set of functions called before a named command is invoked.
Each function will be passed the command name and arguments that were
passed to @code{eshell-named-command}.

If any of the functions returns a non-nil value, the named command
will not be invoked, and that value will be returned from
@code{eshell-named-command}.

In order to substitute an alternate command form for execution, the
hook function should throw it using the tag @code{eshell-replace-command}.
For example:

@example
(add-hook 'eshell-named-command-hook 'subst-with-cd)
(defun subst-with-cd (command args)
  (throw 'eshell-replace-command
  (eshell-parse-command "cd" args)))
@end example

Although useless, the above code will cause any non-glob, non-Lisp
command (i.e., @samp{ls} as opposed to @samp{*ls} or @samp{(ls)}) to be replaced by a
call to @code{cd} using the arguments that were passed to the function.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-pre-rewrite-command-hook
A hook run before command rewriting begins.
The terms of the command to be rewritten is passed as arguments, and
may be modified in place.  Any return value is ignored.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-rewrite-command-hook
A set of functions used to rewrite the command argument.
Once parsing of a command line is completed, the next step is to
rewrite the initial argument into something runnable.

A module may wish to associate special behavior with certain argument
syntaxes at the beginning of a command line.  They are welcome to do
so by adding a function to this hook.  The first function to return a
substitute command form is the one used.  Each function is passed the
command's full argument list, which is a list of sexps (typically
forms or strings).
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-post-rewrite-command-hook
A hook run after command rewriting is finished.
Each function is passed the symbol containing the rewritten command,
which may be modified directly.  Any return value is ignored.
@end defvr

@node External commands, I/O management, Command invocation, Top
@chapter External commands

External commands are invoked when operating system executables are
loaded into memory, thus beginning a new process.

To force a command to invoked external, either provide an explicit
pathname for the command argument, or prefix the command name with
an asterix character.  Example:

@example
grep        ; make invoke `grep' Lisp function, or `eshell/grep'
/bin/grep   ; will definitely invoke /bin/grep
* grep        ; will also invoke /bin/grep
@end example

@defvr {User Option} eshell-binary-suffixes
A list of suffixes used when searching for executable files.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-force-execution
If non-nil, try to execute binary files regardless of permissions.
This can be useful on systems like Windows, where the operating system
doesn't happen to honor the permission bits in certain cases; or in
cases where you want to associate an interpreter with a particular
kind of script file, but the language won't let you but a @samp{#!}
interpreter line in the file, and you don't want to make it executable
since nothing else but Eshell will be able to understand
@code{eshell-interpreter-alist}.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-windows-shell-file
The name of the shell command to use for DOS/Windows batch files.
This defaults to nil on non-Windows systems, where this variable is
wholly ignored.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-interpreter-alist
An alist defining interpreter substitutions.
Each member is a cons cell of the form:

@example
(MATCH . INTERPRETER)
@end example

MATCH should be a regexp, which is matched against the command name,
or a function.  If either returns a non-nil value, then INTERPRETER
will be used for that command.

If INTERPRETER is a string, it will be called as the command name,
with the original command name passed as the first argument, with all
subsequent arguments following.  If INTERPRETER is a function, it will
be called with all of those arguments.  Note that interpreter
functions should throw @code{eshell-replace-command} with the alternate
command form, or they should return a value compatible with the
possible return values of @code{eshell-external-command}, which see.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-alternate-command-hook
A hook run whenever external command lookup fails.
If a functions wishes to provide an alternate command, they must throw
it using the tag @code{eshell-replace-command}.  This is done because the
substituted command need not be external at all, and therefore must be
passed up to a higher level for re-evaluation.

Or, if the function returns a filename, that filename will be invoked
with the current command arguments rather than the command specified
by the user on the command line.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-command-interpreter-max-length
The maximum length of any command interpreter string, plus args.
@end defvr

@chapter I/O management

Eshell's I/O management code provides a scheme for treating many
different kinds of objects---symbols, files, buffers, etc.---as
though they were files.

At the moment, only output redirection is supported in Eshell.  To
use input redirection, the following syntax will work, assuming
that the command after the pipe is always an external command:

@example
cat <file> | <command>
@end example

Otherwise, output redirection and piping are provided in a manner
consistent with most shells.  Therefore, only unique features are
mentioned here.

@node Pseudo-devices, Multiple output targets, Insertion, I/O management
@section Pseudo-devices

A few pseudo-devices are provided, since Emacs cannot write
directly to a UNIX device file:

@example
echo alpha > /dev/null   ; the bit bucket
echo alpha > /dev/kill   ; set the kill ring
echo alpha >> /dev/clip  ; append to the clipboard
@end example


@node Multiple output targets,  , Pseudo-devices, I/O management
@section Multiple output targets

Eshell can write to multiple output targets, including pipes.
Example:

@example
(+ 1 2) > a > b > c   ; prints number to all three files
(+ 1 2) > a | wc      ; prints to 'a', and pipes to 'wc'
@end example

@defvr {User Option} eshell-number-of-handles
The number of file handles that eshell supports.
Currently this is standard input, output and error.  But even all of
these Emacs does not currently support with asynchronous processes
(which is what eshell uses so that you can continue doing work in
other buffers) .
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-output-handle
The index of the standard output handle.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-error-handle
The index of the standard error handle.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-buffer-shorthand
If non-nil, a symbol name can be used for a buffer in redirection.
If nil, redirecting to a buffer requires buffer name syntax.  If this
variable is set, redirection directly to Lisp symbols will be
impossible.

Example:

@example
echo hello > '*scratch*  ; works if `eshell-buffer-shorthand' is t
echo hello > #<buffer *scratch*>  ; always works
@end example
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-print-queue-size
The size of the print queue, for doing buffered printing.
This is basically a speed enhancement, to avoid blocking the Lisp code
from executing while Emacs is redisplaying.
@end defvr

@node User interface, Extension modules, I/O management, Top
@chapter User interface

This module contains code for handling input from the user.

Basically, Eshell is used just like shell mode (<M-x shell>).  The
keystrokes for navigating the buffer, and accessing the command
history, are identical.  Unlike shell mode, however, Eshell mode's
governing process is Emacs itself.  With shell mode, an inferior
shell process is executed that communicates with Emacs via comint
---a mode for handling sub-process interaction.  Eshell mode, on
the other hand, is a truly native Emacs shell.  No subprocess are
invoked except the ones requested by the user at the prompt.

After entering a command, use @kbd{RET} to invoke it ([Command
invocation]) .  If there is a command on disk, it will be executed
as in a normal shell.  If there is no command by that name on disk,
but a Lisp function with that name is defined, the Lisp function
will be called, using the arguments passed on the command line.

Some of the other features of the command interaction mode are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@kbd{M-RET} can be used to accumulate further commands while a
command is currently running.  Since all input is passed to the
subprocess being executed, there is no automatic input queueing
as there is with other shells.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-t} can be used to truncate the buffer if it grows too
large.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-r} will move point to the beginning of the output of the
last command.  With a prefix argument, it will narrow to view
only that output.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-o} will delete the output from the last command.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-f} will move forward a complete shell argument.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-b} will move backward a complete shell argument.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-delete-exited-processes
If nil, process entries will stick around until @code{jobs} is run.
This variable sets the buffer-local value of @code{delete-exited-processes}
in Eshell buffers.

This variable causes Eshell to mimic the behavior of bash when set to
nil.  It allows the user to view the exit status of a completed subjob
(process) at their leisure, because the process entry remains in
memory until the user examines it using \[list-processes].

Otherwise, if @code{eshell-done-messages-in-minibuffer} is nil, and this
variable is set to t, the only indication the user will have that a
subjob is done is that it will no longer appears in the process list
display.

Note that Eshell will have to be restarted for a change in this

Called each time a process is exec'd by @code{eshell-gather-process-output}.
It is passed one argument, which is the process that was just started.
It is useful for things that must be done each time a process is
executed in a eshell mode buffer (e.g., @code{process-kill-without-query}).
In contrast, @code{eshell-mode-hook} is only executed once when the buffer
is created.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-kill-hook
Called when a process run by @code{eshell-gather-process-output} has ended.
It is passed two arguments: the process that was just ended, and the
termination status (as a string).  Note that the first argument may be
nil, in which case the user attempted to send a signal, but there was
no relevant process.  This can be used for displaying help
information, for example.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-kill-process-wait-time
Seconds to wait between sending termination signals to a subprocess.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-kill-process-signals
Signals used to kill processes when an Eshell buffer exits.
Eshell calls each of these signals in order when an Eshell buffer is
killed; if the process is still alive afterwards, Eshell waits a
number of seconds defined by @code{eshell-kill-process-wait-time}, and
tries the next signal in the list.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-kill-processes-on-exit
If non-nil, kill active processes when exiting an Eshell buffer.
Emacs will only kill processes owned by that Eshell buffer.

If nil, ownership of background and foreground processes reverts to
Emacs itself, and will die only if the user exits Emacs, calls
@code{kill-process}, or terminates the processes externally.

If @code{ask}, Emacs prompts the user before killing any processes.

If @code{every}, it prompts once for every process.

If t, it kills all buffer-owned processes without asking.

Processes are first sent SIGHUP, then SIGINT, then SIGQUIT, then
SIGKILL.  The variable @code{eshell-kill-process-wait-time} specifies how
long to delay between signals.

@node Variable handling, Command aliases, General utilities, Top
@chapter Variable handling

Variable interpolation is introduced whenever the @samp{$} character
appears unquoted in any argument (except when that argument is
surrounded by single quotes) .  It may be used to interpolate a
variable value, a subcommand, or even the result of a Lisp form.

These are the possible variable interpolation syntaxes.  Also keep
in mind that if an argument looks like a number, it will be
converted to a number.  This is not significant when invoking
external commands, but it's important when calling Lisp functions.

@example
$VARIABLE
@end example

Interval the value of an environment variable, or a Lisp variable

@example
$ALSO-VAR
@end example

``-'' is a legal part of a variable name.

@example
$<MYVAR>-TOO
@end example

Only ``MYVAR'' is part of the variable name in this case.

@example
$#VARIABLE
@end example

Returns the length of the value of VARIABLE.  This could also be
done using the @code{length} Lisp function.

@example
$(lisp)
@end example

Returns result of lisp evaluation.  Note: Used alone like this, it
is identical to just saying (lisp); but with the variable expansion
form, the result may be interpolated a larger string, such as
@samp{$(lisp)/other}.

@example
$@{command@}
@end example

Returns the value of an eshell subcommand.  See the note above
regarding Lisp evaluations.

@example
$ANYVAR[10]
@end example

Return the 10th element of ANYVAR.  If ANYVAR's value is a string,
it will be split in order to make it a list.  The splitting will
occur at whitespace.

@example
$ANYVAR[: 10]
@end example

As above, except that splitting occurs at the colon now.

@example
$ANYVAR[: 10 20]
@end example

As above, but instead of returning just a string, it now returns a
list of two strings.  If the result is being interpolated into a
larger string, this list will be flattened into one big string,
with each element separated by a space.

@example
$ANYVAR["\\\\" 10]
@end example

Separate on backslash characters.  Actually, the first argument---
if it doesn't have the form of a number, or a plain variable name
---can be any regular expression.  So to split on numbers, use
@samp{$ANYVAR["[0-9]+" 10 20]}.

@example
$ANYVAR[hello]
@end example

Calls @code{assoc} on ANYVAR with @samp{hello}, expecting it to be an alist.

@example
$#ANYVAR[hello]
@end example

Returns the length of the cdr of the element of ANYVAR who car is
equal to "hello".

There are also a few special variables defined by Eshell.  @samp{$$} is
the value of the last command (t or nil, in the case of an external
command).  This makes it possible to chain results:

@example
/tmp $ echo /var/spool/mail/johnw
/var/spool/mail/johnw
/tmp $ dirname $$
/var/spool/mail/
/tmp $ cd $$
/var/spool/mail $
@end example

@samp{$_} refers to the last argument of the last command.  And $?
contains the exit code of the last command (0 or 1 for Lisp
functions, based on successful completion).

@defvr {User Option} eshell-prefer-lisp-variables
If non-nil, prefer Lisp variables to environment variables.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-complete-export-definition
If non-nil, completing names for @code{export} shows current definition.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-variable-name-regexp
A regexp identifying what constitutes a variable name reference.
Note that this only applies for @samp{$NAME}.  If the syntax @samp{$<NAME>} is
used, then NAME can contain any character, including angle brackets,
if they are quoted with a backslash.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-variable-aliases-list
This list provides aliasing for variable references.
It is very similar in concept to what @code{eshell-user-aliases-list} does
for commands.  Each member of this defines defines the name of a
command, and the Lisp value to return for that variable if it is
accessed via the syntax @samp{$NAME}.

If the value is a function, that function will be called with two
arguments: the list of the indices that was used in the reference, and
whether the user is requesting the length of the ultimate element.
For example, a reference of @samp{$NAME[10][20]} would result in the
function for alias @code{NAME} being called (assuming it were aliased to a
function), and the arguments passed to this function would be the list
@samp{(10 20)}, and nil.
@end defvr

@node Command aliases, Login banner, Variable handling, Top
@chapter Command aliases

Command aliases allow for easy definition of alternate commands.

Command aliases greatly simplify the definition of new commands.
They exist as an alternative to alias functions, which are
otherwise quite superior, being more flexible and natural to the
Emacs Lisp environment (if somewhat trickier to define; @ref{Alias
functions}).


@menu
* Creating aliases::            
* Auto-correction of bad commands::  
@end menu

@node Creating aliases, Auto-correction of bad commands, Command aliases, Command aliases
@section Creating aliases

The user interface is simple: type @samp{alias} followed by the command
name followed by the definition.  Argument references are made
using @samp{$1}, @samp{$2}, etc., or @samp{$*}.  For example:

@example
alias ll 'ls -l $*'
@end example

This will cause the command @samp{ll NEWS} to be replaced by @samp{ls -l
NEWS}.  This is then passed back to the command parser for
reparsing.@footnote{Only the command text specified in the alias definition
will be reparsed.  Argument references (such as @samp{$*}) are handled
using variable values, which means that the expansion will not be
reparsed, but used directly.}

To delete an alias, specify its name without a definition:

@example
alias ll
@end example

Aliases are written to disk immediately after being defined or
deleted.  The filename in which they are kept is defined by the
following variable:

@defvr {User Option} eshell-aliases-file
The file in which aliases are kept.
Whenever an alias is defined by the user, using the @code{alias} command,
it will be written to this file.  Thus, alias definitions (and
deletions) are always permanent.  This approach was chosen for the
sake of simplicity, since that's pretty much the only benefit to be
gained by using this module.
@end defvr


The format of this file is quite basic.  It specifies the alias
definitions in almost exactly the same way that the user entered
them, minus any argument quoting (since interpolation is not done
when the file is read).  Hence, it is possible to add new aliases
to the alias file directly, using a text editor rather than the
@code{alias} command.  Or, this method can be used for editing aliases
that have already defined.

Here is an example of a few different aliases, and they would
appear in the aliases file:

@example
alias clean rm -fr **/.#*~
alias commit cvs commit -m changes $*
alias ll ls -l $*
alias info (info)
alias reindex glimpseindex -o ~/Mail
alias compact for i in ~/Mail/**/*~*.bz2(Lk+50) @{ bzip2 -9v $i @}
@end example


@node Auto-correction of bad commands,  , Creating aliases, Command aliases
@section Auto-correction of bad commands

When a user enters the same unknown command many times during a
session, it is likely that they are experiencing a spelling
difficulty associated with a certain command.  To combat this,
Eshell will offer to automatically define an alias for that
mispelled command, once a given tolerance threshold has been
reached.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-bad-command-tolerance
The number of failed commands to ignore before creating an alias.
@end defvr


Whenever the same bad command name is encountered this many times,
the user will be prompted in the minibuffer to provide an alias
name.  An alias definition will then be created which will result
in an equal call to the correct name.  In this way, Eshell
gradually learns about the commands that the user mistypes
frequently, and will automatically correct them!

Note that a @samp{$*} is automatically appended at the end of the alias
definition, so that entering it is unnecessary when specifying the
corrected command name.

@chapter Login banner

This sample module displays a welcome banner at login.
It exists so that others wishing to create their own Eshell extension
modules may have a simple template to begin with.

There is nothing to be done or configured in order to use this

@code{eshell-modules-list}.  It will then display a version information
message whenever Eshell is loaded.

This code is only an example of a how to write a well-formed
extension module for Eshell.  The better way to display login text
is to use the @code{eshell-script} module, and to echo the desired
strings from the user's @code{eshell-login-script} file.

There is one configuration variable, which demonstrates how to
properly define a customization variable in an extension module.
In this case, it allows the user to change the string which

@node Basic shell commands, Argument completion, Login banner, Top
@chapter Basic shell commands

The ``basic'' code provides a set of convenience functions which
are traditionally considered shell builtins.  Since all of the
functionality provided by them is accessible through Lisp, they are
not really builtins at all, but offer a command-oriented way to do the
same thing.

There are very few basic Eshell commands---so-called builtins.
They are: echo, umask, and version.


@menu
* @code{echo}::                 
* @code{umask}::                
* @code{version}::              
@end menu

@node @code{echo}, @code{umask}, Basic shell commands, Basic shell commands
@section @code{echo}

The @code{echo} command repeats its arguments to the screen.  It is
optional whether this is done in a Lisp-friendly fashion (so that
the value of echo is useful to a Lisp command using the result of
echo as an argument), or whether it should try to act like a normal
shell echo, and always result in a flat string being returned.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-plain-echo-behavior
If non-nil, @code{echo} tries to behave like an ordinary shell echo.
This comes at some detriment to Lisp functionality.  However, the Lisp
equivalent of @code{echo} can always be achieved by using @code{identity}.
@end defvr


An example of the difference is the following:

@example
echo Hello world
@end example

If @code{eshell-plain-echo-behavior} is non-nil, this will yield the
string ``Hello world''.  If Lisp behavior is enabled, however, it
will yield a list whose two elements are the strings ``Hello'' and
``world''.  The way to write an equivalent expression for both would
be:

@example
echo "Hello world"
@end example

This always returns a single string.


@node @code{umask}, @code{version}, @code{echo}, Basic shell commands
@section @code{umask}

The umask command changes the default file permissions for newly
created files.  It uses the same syntax as bash.


@node @code{version},  , @code{umask}, Basic shell commands
@section @code{version}

This command reports the version number for Eshell and all its
dependent module, including the date when those modules were last
modified.
@node Argument completion, Directory navigation, Basic shell commands, Top
@chapter Argument completion

This module provides a programmable completion function bound to
the TAB key, which allows for completing command names, file names,
variable names, arguments, etc.

Eshell, by using the pcomplete package, provides a full
programmable completion facility that is comparable to shells like
tcsh or zsh.

Completions are context-sensitive, which means that pressing @kbd{TAB}
after the command @samp{rmdir} will result in a list of directories,
while doing so after @samp{rm} will result in a list of all file
entries.

Many builtin completion rules are provided, for commands such as
@code{cvs}, or RedHat's @code{rpm} utility.  Adding new completion rules is
no more difficult than writing a plain Lisp functions, and they can
be debugged, profiled, and compiled using exactly the same
facilities (since in fact, they @strong{are} just Lisp functions).  See
the definition of the function @code{pcomplete/make} for an example of
how to write a completion function.

The completion facility is very easy to use.  Just press TAB.  If
there are a large number of possible completions, a buffer will
appearing showing a list of them.  Completions may be selected from
that buffer using the mouse.  If no completion is selected, and the
user starts doing something else, the display buffer will
automatically disappear.

If the list of possible completions is very small, Eshell will
``cycle'' through them, selecting a different entry each time @kbd{TAB}
is pressed.  @kbd{S-TAB} may be used to cycle in the opposite
direction.

Glob patterns can also be cycled.  For example, entering @samp{echo
x*<tab>} will cycle through all the filenames beginning with @samp{x}.
This is done because the glob list is treated as though it were a
list of possible completions.  Pressing @kbd{C-c SPC} will insert all
of the matching glob patterns at point.

If a Lisp form is being entered, @kbd{TAB} will complete the Lisp
symbol name, in exactly the same way that @kbd{M-TAB} does in Emacs
Lisp mode.

The list of possible completions can be viewed at any point by
pressing @kbd{M-?}.

Finally, context-related help can be accessed by pressing @kbd{C-c i}.
This only works well if the completion function has provided Eshell
with sufficient pointers to locate the relevant help text.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-show-lisp-completions

@defvr {User Option} eshell-cmpl-expand-before-complete
If non-nil, expand the current argument before completing it.
This means that typing something such as @samp{$HOME/bi} followed by
M-x pcomplete-argument will cause the variable reference to be
resolved first, and the resultant value that will be completed against
to be inserted in the buffer.  Note that exactly what gets expanded
and how is entirely up to the behavior of the
@code{pcomplete-parse-arguments-function}.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cmpl-cycle-completions
If non-nil, hitting the TAB key cycles through the completion list.
Typical Emacs behavior is to complete as much as possible, then pause
waiting for further input.  Then if TAB is hit again, show a list of
possible completions.  When @code{pcomplete-cycle-completions} is non-nil,
it acts more like zsh or 4nt, showing the first maximal match first,
followed by any further matches on each subsequent pressing of the TAB
key.  M-x pcomplete-list is the key to press if the user wants to see
the list of possible completions.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cmpl-cycle-cutoff-length
If the number of completions is greater than this, don't cycle.
This variable is a compromise between the traditional Emacs style of
completion, and the ``cycling'' style.  Basically, if there are more
than this number of completions possible, don't automatically pick the
first one and then expect the user to press TAB to cycle through them.
Typically, when there are a large number of completion possibilities,
the user wants to see them in a list buffer so that they can know what
options are available.  But if the list is small, it means the user
has already entered enough input to disambiguate most of the
possibilities, and therefore they are probably most interested in
cycling through the candidates.  Set this value to nil if you want
cycling to always be enabled.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cmpl-restore-window-delay
The number of seconds to wait before restoring completion windows.
Once the completion window has been displayed, if the user then goes
on to type something else, that completion window will be removed from
the display (actually, the original window configuration before it was
displayed will be restored), after this many seconds of idle time.  If
set to nil, completion windows will be left on second until the user
removes them manually.  If set to 0, they will disappear immediately
after the user enters a key other than TAB.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-command-completion-function
Function called for completing the initial command argument.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cmpl-command-name-function
Function called for determining the current command name.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-default-completion-function
Function called when no completion rule can be found.
This function is used to generate completions for every argument.
@end defvr

@node Directory navigation, Extended filename globbing, Argument completion, Top
@chapter Directory navigation

Directory navigation involves changing directories, examining the
current directory, maintaining a directory stack, and also keeping
track of a history of the last directory locations the user was in.
Emacs does provide standard Lisp definitions of @code{pwd} and @code{cd}, but
they lack somewhat in feel from the typical shell equivalents.

The only special feature that Eshell offers in the last-dir-ring.
To view the ring, enter:

@example
cd =
@end example

Changing to an index within the ring is done using:

@example
cd -      ; same as cd -0
cd -4
@end example

Or, it is possible to change the first member in the ring which
matches a regexp:

@example
cd =bcc   ; change to the last directory visited containing "bcc"
@end example

This ring is maintained automatically, and is persisted across
Eshell sessions.  It is a separate mechanism from @code{pushd} and
@code{popd}, and the two may be used at the same time.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-pwd-convert-function
The function used to normalize the value of Eshell's @code{pwd}.
The value returned by @code{pwd} is also used when recording the
last-visited directory in the last-dir-ring, so it will affect the
form of the list used by @samp{cd =}.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ask-to-save-last-dir
Determine if the last-dir-ring should be automatically saved.
The last-dir-ring is always preserved when exiting an Eshell buffer.
However, when Emacs is being shut down, this variable determines
whether to prompt the user, or just save the ring.
If set to nil, it means never ask whether to save the last-dir-ring.
If set to t, always ask if any Eshell buffers are open at exit time.
If set to @code{always}, the list-dir-ring will always be saved, silently.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cd-shows-directory
If non-nil, using @code{cd} will report the directory it changes to.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-cd-on-directory
If non-nil, do a cd if a directory is in command position.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-directory-change-hook
A hook to run when the current directory changes.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-list-files-after-cd
If non-nil, call ``ls'' with any remaining args after doing a cd.
This is provided for convenience, since the same effect is easily
achieved by adding a function to @code{eshell-directory-change-hook} that
calls ``ls'' and references @code{eshell-last-arguments}.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-pushd-tohome
If non-nil, make pushd with no arg behave as @samp{pushd ~} (like @code{cd}).
This mirrors the optional behavior of tcsh.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-pushd-dextract
If non-nil, make ``pushd +n'' pop the nth dir to the stack top.
This mirrors the optional behavior of tcsh.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-pushd-dunique
If non-nil, make pushd only add unique directories to the stack.
This mirrors the optional behavior of tcsh.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-dirtrack-verbose
If non-nil, show the directory stack following directory change.
This is effective only if directory tracking is enabled.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-last-dir-ring-file-name
If non-nil, name of the file to read/write the last-dir-ring.
See also @code{eshell-read-last-dir-ring} and @code{eshell-write-last-dir-ring}.
If it is nil, the last-dir-ring will not be written to disk.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-last-dir-ring-size
If non-nil, the size of the directory history ring.
This ring is added to every time @code{cd} or @code{pushd} is used.  It simply
stores the most recent directory locations Eshell has been in.  To
return to the most recent entry, use @samp{cd -} (equivalent to @samp{cd -0}).
To return to an older entry, use @samp{cd -N}, where N is an integer less
than @code{eshell-last-dir-ring-size}.  To return to the last directory
matching a particular regexp, use @samp{cd =REGEXP}.  To display the
directory history list, use @samp{cd =}.

This mechanism is very similar to that provided by @code{pushd}, except
it's far more automatic.  @code{pushd} allows the user to decide which
directories gets pushed, and its size is unlimited.

@code{eshell-last-dir-ring} is meant for users who don't use @code{pushd}
explicity very much, but every once in a while would like to return to
a previously visited directory without having to type in the whole
thing again.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-last-dir-unique
If non-nil, @code{eshell-last-dir-ring} contains only unique entries.
@end defvr

@node Extended filename globbing, History list management, Directory navigation, Top
@chapter Extended filename globbing

This module provides extended globbing syntax, similar what is used
by zsh for filename generation.

The globbing code used by Eshell closely follows the syntax used by
zsh.  Basically, here is a summary of examples:

@example
echo a*       ; anything starting with 'a'
echo a#b      ; zero or more 'a's, then 'b'
echo a##b     ; one or more 'a's, then 'b'
echo a?       ; a followed by any character
echo a*~ab    ; 'a', then anything, but not 'ab'
echo c*~*~    ; all files beginning with 'c', except backups (*~)
@end example

Recursive globbing is also supported:

@example
echo **/*.c   ; all '.c' files at or under current directory
echo ***/*.c  ; same as above, but traverse symbolic links
@end example

Using argument predication, the recursive globbing syntax is
sufficient to replace the use of @samp{find @kbd{expr} | xargs @kbd{cmd}} in
most cases.  For example, to change the readership of all files
belonging to @samp{johnw} in the @samp{/tmp} directory or lower, use:

@example
chmod go-r /tmp/**/*(u'johnw')
@end example

The glob above matches all of the files beneath @samp{/tmp} that are
owned by the user @samp{johnw}.  See @ref{Value modifiers and predicates},
for more information about argument predication.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-include-dot-files
If non-nil, glob patterns will match files beginning with a dot.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-include-dot-dot
If non-nil, glob patterns that match dots will match . and ..
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-case-insensitive
If non-nil, glob pattern matching will ignore case.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-show-progress
If non-nil, display progress messages during a recursive glob.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-error-if-no-glob
If non-nil, it is an error for a glob pattern not to match.
 This mimcs the behavior of zsh if non-nil, but bash if nil.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-chars-list
List of additional characters used in extended globbing.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-glob-translate-alist
An alist for translation of extended globbing characters.
@end defvr

@node History list management, Implementation of @code{ls} in Lisp, Extended filename globbing, Top
@chapter History list management

This module provides command history management.

Eshell's history facility imitates the syntax used by bash
([(bash)History Interaction]).  Thus:

@example
!ls           ; repeat the last command beginning with 'ls'
!?ls          ; repeat the last command containing ls
echo !ls:2    ; echo the second arg of the last 'ls' command
!ls<tab>      ; complete against all possible words in this
              ; position, by looking at the history list
!ls<C-c SPC>  ; expand any matching history input at point
@end example

Also, most of @code{comint-mode}s keybindings are accepted:

@example
M-r     ; search backward for a previous command by regexp
M-s     ; search forward for a previous command by regexp
M-p     ; access the last command entered, repeatable
M-n     ; access the first command entered, repeatable
@end example

@example
C-c M-r ; using current input, find a matching command thus, with
        ; 'ls' as the current input, it will go back to the same
        ; command that '!ls' would have selected
C-c M-s ; same, but in reverse order
@end example

Note that some of these keybindings are only available if the
@code{eshell-rebind} is not in use, in which case M-p does what C-c M-r
normally would do, and C-p is used instead of M-p.  It may seem
confusing, but the intention is to make the most useful
functionality the most easily accessible.  If @code{eshell-rebind} is
not being used, history navigation will use comint's keybindings;
if it is, history navigation tries to use similar keybindings to
bash.  This is all configurable, of course.
@node Implementation of @code{ls} in Lisp, Value modifiers and predicates, History list management, Top
@chapter Implementation of @code{ls} in Lisp

This module implements the ``ls'' utility fully in Lisp.  If it is
passed any unrecognized command switches, it will revert to the
operating system's version.  This version of ``ls'' uses text
properties to colorize its output based on the setting of
@code{eshell-ls-use-colors}.

Most of the command switches recognized by GNU's ls utility are
supported ([(fileutils)ls invocation]).

@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-unload-hook
When unloading @code{eshell-ls}, restore the definition of @code{insert-directory}.

@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-default-blocksize
The default blocksize to use when display file sizes with -s.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-initial-args
If non-nil, any interactive usage of ls implies these args first.
This can be used to make the @samp{-h} flag (display in human readable

This variable is ignored if output is being redirected.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-exclude-regexp

@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-backup-regexp
A regular expression that matches names of backup files.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-product-regexp
A regular expression that matches names of product files.
Products are files that get generated from a source file, and hence
ought to be recreatable if they are deleted.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-clutter-regexp
A regular expression that matches names of junk files.
These are mainly files that get created for various reasons, but don't
really need to stick around for very long.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-ls-highlight-alist
This alist correlates test functions to color.
The format of the members of this alist is

@example
(TEST-SEXP . FACE)
@end example

If TEST-SEXP evals to non-nil, that face will be used to highlight the
name of the file.  The first match wins.  @code{file} and @code{attrs} are in
scope during the evaluation of TEST-SEXP.
@end defvr

@node Value modifiers and predicates, Command prompts, Implementation of @code{ls} in Lisp, Top
@chapter Value modifiers and predicates

This module allows for predicates to be applied to globbing
patterns (similar to zsh), in addition to string modifiers which can
be applied either to globbing results, variable references, or just
ordinary strings.

Argument predication is used to affect which members of a list are
selected for use as argument.  This is most useful with globbing,
but can be used on any list argument, to select certain members.

Argument modifiers are used to manipulate argument values.  For
example, sorting lists, upcasing words, substituting characters,
etc.

Here are some examples of how to use argument predication.  Most of
the predicates and modifiers are modeled after those provided by
zsh.

@example
ls -ld *(/)           ; list all directories
ls -l *(@@u'johnw')    ; list all symlinks owned by 'johnw'
bzip2 -9v **/*(a+30)  ; compress everything which hasn't been
                        accessed in 30 days
echo *.c(:o:R)     ; a reversed, sorted list of C files
* (^@@:U^u0)         ; all non-symlinks not owned by 'root', upcased
chmod u-x *(U*)    : remove exec bit on all executables owned by user
@end example

See the zsh docs for more on the syntax ([(zsh.info)Filename
Generation]).

@defvr {User Option} eshell-predicate-alist

This module provides command prompts, and navigation between them,
as is common with most shells.

Most of the prompt navigation commands of @code{comint-mode} are
supported, such as C-c C-n, C-c C-p, etc.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-prompt-function
A function that returns the Eshell prompt string.
Make sure to update @code{eshell-prompt-regexp} so that it will match your
prompt.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-prompt-regexp
A regexp which fully matches your eshell prompt.
This setting is important, since it affects how eshell will interpret
the lines that are passed to it.
If this variable is changed, all Eshell buffers must be exited and
re-entered for it to take effect.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-highlight-prompt
If non-nil, Eshell should highlight the prompt.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-before-prompt-hook
A list of functions to call before outputting the prompt.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-after-prompt-hook
A list of functions to call after outputting the prompt.
Note that if @code{eshell-scroll-show-maximum-output} is non-nil, then
setting @code{eshell-show-maximum-output} here won't do much.  It depends
on whether the user wants the resizing to happen while output is
arriving, or after.
@end defvr

@node Rebind keys at input, Running script files., Command prompts, Top
@chapter Rebind keys at input

This module allows for special keybindings that only take effect
while the point is in a region of input text.  By default, it binds
C-a to move to the beginning of the input text (rather than just the
beginning of the line), and C-p and C-n to move through the input
history, C-u kills the current input text, etc.  It also, if
@code{eshell-confine-point-to-input} is non-nil, does not allow certain
commands to cause the point to leave the input area, such as
@code{backward-word}, @code{previous-line}, etc.  This module intends to mimic
the behavior of normal shells while the user editing new input text.

User Variables:

@defvr {User Option} eshell-rebind-keys-alist
Bind some keys differently if point is in input text.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-confine-point-to-input
If non-nil, do not allow the point to leave the current input.
This is more difficult to do nicely in Emacs than one might think.
Basically, the @code{point-left} attribute is added to the input text, and
a function is placed on that hook to take the point back to
@code{eshell-last-output-end} every time the user tries to move away.  But
since there are many cases in which the point @emph{ought} to move away
(for programmatic reasons), the variable
@code{eshell-cannot-leave-input-list} defines commands which are affected
from this rule.  However, this list is by no means as complete as it
probably should be, so basically all one can hope for is that other
people will left the point alone in the Eshell buffer.  Sigh.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-error-if-move-away
If non-nil, consider it an error to try to move outside current input.
This is default behavior of shells like bash.

@node Smart display of output, Running visual commands, Running script files., Top
@chapter Smart display of output

This module combines the facility of normal, modern shells with
some of the edit/review concepts inherent in the design of Plan 9's
9term.  See the docs for more details.

Most likely you will have to turn this option on and play around with
it to get a real sense of how it works.

The best way to get a sense of what this code is trying to do is by
using it.  Basically, the philosophy represents a blend between the
ease of use of modern day shells, and the review-before-you-proceed
mentality of Plan 9's 9term.

@itemize @bullet
@item
When you invoke a command, it is assumed that you want to read
the output of that command.

@item
If the output is not what you wanted, it is assumed that you will
want to edit, and then resubmit a refined version of that
command.

@item
If the output is valid, pressing any self-inserting character key
will jump to end of the buffer and insert that character, in
order to begin entry of a new command.

@item
If you show an intention to edit the previous command---by
moving around within it---then the next self-inserting
characters will insert @strong{there}, instead of at the bottom of the
buffer.

@item
If you show an intention to review old commands, such as M-p or
M-r, point will jump to the bottom of the buffer before invoking
that command.

@item
If none of the above has happened yet (i.e., your point is just
sitting on the previous command), you can use SPACE and BACKSPACE
(or DELETE) to page forward and backward @strong{through the output of
the last command only}.  It will constrain the movement of the
point and window so that the maximum amount of output is always
displayed at all times.

@item
While output is being generated from a command, the window will
be constantly reconfigured (until it would otherwise make no
difference) in order to always show you the most output from the
command possible.  This happens if you change window sizes,
scroll, etc.

@item
Like I said, it's not really comprehensible until you try it! ;)

@defvr {User Option} eshell-smart-display-navigate-list
A list of commands which cause Eshell to jump to the end of buffer.
@end defvr


@defvr {User Option} eshell-smart-space-goes-to-end
If non-nil, space will go to end of buffer when point-max is visible.
That is, if a command is running and the user presses SPACE at a time
when the end of the buffer is visible, point will go to the end of the
buffer and smart-display will be turned off (that is, subsequently
pressing backspace will not cause the buffer to scroll down).

This feature is provided to make it very easy to watch the output of a
long-running command, such as make, where it's more desirable to see
the output go by than to review it afterward.

Setting this variable to nil means that space and backspace will
always have a consistent behavior, which is to move back and forth
through displayed output.  But it also means that enabling output
tracking requires the user to manually move point to the end of the
buffer using \[end-of-buffer].
@end defvr

This variable indicates where point should jump to after a command.
The options are @code{begin}, @code{after} or @code{end}.

@node Running visual commands, UNIX commands in Lisp, Smart display of output, Top
@chapter Running visual commands

This module causes visual commands (e.g., @samp{vi}) to be executed by
the @code{term} package, which comes with Emacs.  This package handles most
of the ANSI control codes, allowing curses-based applications to run
within an Emacs window.  The variable @code{eshell-visual-commands} defines
which commands are considered visual in nature.

At the moment, eshell is stream-based in its interactive input and
output.  This means that full-screen commands, such as ``vi'' or
``lynx'', will not display correctly.  These are therefore thought of
as ``visual'' programs.  In order to run these progrem under Emacs,
Eshell uses the term.el package, and invokes them in a separate
buffer, giving the illusion that Eshell itself is allowing these
visual processes to execute.

@defvr {User Option} eshell-visual-commands

@node UNIX commands in Lisp, Extra alias functions, Running visual commands, Top
@chapter UNIX commands in Lisp

This module defines many of the more common UNIX utilities as
aliases implemented in Lisp.  These include mv, ln, cp, rm, etc.  If
the user passes arguments which are too complex, or are unrecognized
by the Lisp variant, the external version will be called (if
available).  The only reason not to use them would be because they are
usually much slower.  But in several cases their tight integration
with Eshell makes them more versatile than their traditional cousins
(such as being able to use @code{kill} to kill Eshell background processes
by name).

This file contains implementations of several UNIX command in Emacs
Lisp, for several reasons:

@example
1) it makes them available on all platforms where the Lisp
   functions used are available
