As a fun little side project I’ve been involved in some Gemini-protocol wiki programming and therefore you can “enjoy” a transmogrified Emacs Wiki via `gemini://emacswiki.org` with an appropriate Gemini client. There's a Gopher and Gemini client for Emacs called [https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/ Elpher] that I like to use.

No web browser I know of has implemented the Gemini protocol. There are a bunch of other clients that you could use instead. [https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html Gemini Clients] has a list.

One would think that eww is better suited for browsing Emacs Wiki via the web, but whenever I visit HTTPS sites using eww, I suffer a two or three second delay.

Anyway. Give Gemini a try, if you’re curious.
