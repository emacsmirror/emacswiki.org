To use Telnet in Emacs running on Windows, you must have either:

* A Windows telnet executable, or
* A Cygwin telnet executable.

There are at least two Emacs telnet commands for use with these two executables -- these are both in library Lisp:telnet-contrib.el.

[:WindowsTelnet]
== Windows Telnet Executable ==

On MS Windows, before you can use ##M-x telnet##, you need a *telnet client* (The default Windows client does not use stdio. You need a different one).

[http://dtelnet.sourceforge.net/ dtelnet] is a suitable alternative.



[:CygwinTelnet]
== Cygwin Telnet Executable ==

: CygWin telnet, the call ##(accept-process-output process)## in telnet.el's ##telnet## function never returns.  

: A workaround is to modify the telnet function and remove ##(accept-process-output)##.

: This [[http://www.khngai.com/emacs/cygwin.php Web Sailor]] article mentions the issue.


== Emacs telnet Commands for Windows ==

* Lisp:telnet-contrib.el has two Emacs commands for MS Windows, which work with both the above the Milavec and Cygwin ports.
* The commands in Lisp:telnet-contrib.el were written by Zoltan Kemenczy and Ngai Kim Hoong, and they seem to still work fine, with both Emacs 20 and Emacs 22. -- DrewAdams
