This page is about library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>, which provides commands to highlight text.

 

[:FacemenuPlus]
== Library `facemenu+.el' Puts Highlight on the Menu ==

If you load library <tt>[[facemenu+.el]]</tt> after you load library
<tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>, then the commands in library ##highlight.el## are also 
available on a '''Highlight''' submenu in the '''Text Properties''' menus. See FaceMenuPlus for more about library ##facemenu+.el##.


If you load library <tt>[[mouse3.el]]</tt> after you load library
##highlight.el## then:

* Commands defined in ##highlight.el## are also available on a '''Highlight'''
submenu of the '''Region''' right-click popup menu.

* Commands `hlt-highlight-symbol' and `hlt-unhighlight-symbol'
are available on the '''Thing at Pointer''' submenu of the '''No Region''' right-click popup menu.









[:Description]
== General Description ==

You can highlight text in two ways using ##highlight.el##, depending
on the value of [[user option]] '''`hlt-use-overlays-flag'''':

* non-`nil' means to highlight using [[overlay]]s
* `nil' means to highlight using [[text property|text properties]]

Overlays are independent from the text itself.  They are not
picked up when you copy and paste text.  By default, highlighting
uses overlays.






[:hlt-use-overlays-flag]
== User Option `hlt-use-overlays-flag' ==

Although highlighting recognizes only `nil' and non-`nil' values for
`hlt-use-overlays-flag', other actions can have different
behavior, depending on the non-`nil' value.  If it is '''`only'''' (the
default value), then only overlay highlighting is affected.  If it
is any other non-`nil' value, then both overlay highlighting and
text-property highlighting are effected.  This is the case, for
instance, for unhighlighting and for navigating among highlights.

For example, for ''un''highlighting, if `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is
non-`nil', then overlay highlighting is removed.  If it is not
`only', then text-property highlighting is removed.  A value of
`nil' thus removes both overlays and text properties.

Keep this sensitivity to the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' in
mind.  For example, if you change the value after adding some
highlighting, then that highlighting might not be removed by
unhighlighting, unless you change the value back again.

You can toggle the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' at any time
between `nil' and its previous non-`nil' value, using command
'''`hlt-toggle-use-overlays-flag''''.






[:PermanentHighlighting]
== Temporary or Permanent Highlighting ==

Generally, highlighting you add is temporary: it is not saved when
you write your buffer to disk.  However, Emacs has a curious and
unfamiliar feature called "formatted" or "enriched" text mode,
which does record highlighting permanently.  See [[Manual:Enriched Mode]].

To save highlighting permanently, do the following:

# `M-x enriched-mode', to put your file buffer in [[minor mode]]
   `enriched-mode'.  You see '''`Enriched'''' in the [[mode line]].

# Choose text-property highlighting, not overlay highlighting, by
   setting [[option]] '''`<tt>[[#hlt-use-overlays-flag]]</tt>''''
 to `nil'.  To do this using [[Customize]], choose menu item '''Highlight using text properties, not
   overlays'''.

# Choose the highlight face to use:
   '''`M-x hlt-choose-default-face''''.

# Highlight in any way provided by library ##highlight.el##.  For example,
   use `hlt-highlighter' (I bind it to `C-x mouse-2') to
   drag-highlight as if using a marker pen.

# Save your file.  Note that, although highlighting in enriched-text mode modifies
   the buffer, it does not ''appear'' modified to Emacs (check the beginning of the mode line), so if you make no other
   changes then using `C-x C-s' does ''not'' save your highlighting
   changes.  To remedy this, just do something besides highlighting --- e.g., add
   a space and delete it --- so that `C-x C-s' saves to disk.

When you reopen your file later, it is automatically in
enriched mode, and your highlighting shows.  However, be aware
that [[FontLock|font-locking]] interferes with enriched mode, so you will
probably want to use it on files where you don't use font-locking.








[:HighlightingCommands]
== Commands ==

You can use any [[face]] to highlight, and you can highlight using the `mouse-face' property instead of the `face' property. A mouse face shows up only when the mouse pointer is over it.


[:hlt-choose-default-face]
The main command to choose a face to use for highlighting (or for
unhighlighting) is '''`hlt-choose-default-face''''.  It reads a face
name, with completion.

But you can alternatively choose a ''color'' name instead of a face
name.  The completion candidates are annotated in buffer
`*Completions*' with `Face' or `Color', to help you identify them.

[:hlt-auto-face-foreground]
If you choose a color instead of a face then an unnamed pseudo
face is created and used.  It has the chosen color as ''background'',
and its foreground color is determined by the value of [[user option]]
'''`hlt-auto-face-foreground''''.  If that option is `nil' then
highlighting does not change the existing foreground color.
Otherwise, the option value is the foreground color used for highlighting.

[:hlt-next-face]
[:hlt-previous-face]
[:CyclingFaces]
Another way to choose the highlighting face is to use command
'''`hlt-next-face'''' or '''`hlt-previous-face''''.  These ''cycle'' among a
smaller set of faces and background colors, the elements in the
list value of option `hlt-auto-face-backgrounds'.  You can use a
numeric [[prefix argument]] with these commands to choose any of the
elements by its absolute position in the list.


[:hlt-auto-face-backgrounds]
[:hlt-auto-faces-flag]
Choosing the default highlighting face using
`hlt-choose-default-face', `hlt-next-face', or `hlt-previous-face'
affects the ''next'' highlighting or unhighlighting operation.  You
can also choose to ''automatically cycle'' among the faces defined by
`hlt-auto-face-backgrounds', with each (un)highlighting command
using the next face in the list.  To choose this behavior,
customize option '''`hlt-auto-faces-flag'''' to non-`nil'.

The commands with '''`region'''' in their name act on the text in the
[[active region]].  If the region is not active then they act on the
text in the whole [[buffer]].  The commands with `to-end' in their
name act on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  See
also [[#WhatGetsHighlighted|What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type]], below.

The commands you will use the most often are perhaps '''`hlt-highlight'''', '''`hlt-highlighter', `hlt-next-highlight'''', and '''`hlt-previous-highlight''''. You might also often use the various
commands to hide and show highlighted text.

[:hlt-highlight]
[:hlt-highlight-region]
[:hlt-unhighlight-region]
[:hlt-highlight-regexp-region]
[:hlt-unhighlight-regexp-region]
[:hlt-highlight-regexp-to-end] 
[:hlt-unhighlight-regexp-to-end] 
You can use command '''`hlt-highlight'''' to highlight or ''un''highlight the [[region]], or to 
highlight or ''un''highlight a ''regexp'' throughout the region, depending on the prefix argument.  It combines the
behaviors of commands `hlt-highlight-region', `hlt-unhighlight-region', `hlt-highlight-regexp-region',
and `hlt-unhighlight-regexp-region'. 
I suggest that you bind `hlt-highlight' to a key --- I use `C-x C-y'.

Commands '''`hlt-highlight-regexp-to-end'''' and '''`hlt-unhighlight-regexp-to-end''''  highlight and unhighlight a regexp from [[point]] to the end of the buffer, respectively.  


[:hlt-highlighter]
Command '''`hlt-highlighter'''' lets you highlight text by simply
dragging the mouse, just as you would use a highlighter (marker).
You can thus highlight text the same way that you drag the mouse
to define the region. (Bind this to, for instance, `C-x mouse-2'.)


[:hlt-eraser]
Command '''`hlt-eraser'''' lets you delete highlighting by dragging the
mouse.  However, its behavior is quite different for overlays and
text properties, and it is perhaps different from you expect.    If
option '''`hlt-use-overlays-flag'''' is not '''`only'''' then it removes
text-property highlighting for '''''*ALL*''''' faces (not just highlighting faces).

A [[prefix argument|prefix arg]] for `hlt-highlighter' and `hlt-eraser' acts the same as for `hlt-next-face': it lets you choose the face to use.  It has no effect for `hlt-eraser' unless `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is `only', in which case it erases the ##N##th face in
`hlt-auto-face-backgrounds', where ##N## is the prefix arg.



[:hlt-highlight-all-prop]
[:hlt-highlight-property-with-value]
[:hlt-mouse-toggle-link-highlighting]
[:hlt-mouse-toggle-property-highlighting]
[:hlt-toggle-link-highlighting]
[:hlt-toggle-property-highlighting]
[:hlt-unhighlight-all-prop]
If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use various commands that
highlight and unhighlight text that has certain text properties
with given values.  You can use them to highlight all text in the
region or buffer that has a given property value.  An example is
highlighting all links (text with property `mouse-face').  These
commands are:

* '''`hlt-highlight-all-prop'''' -- Highlight text that has a given property with any (non-`nil') value.
* '''`hlt-highlight-property-with-value'''' -- Highlight text that has a given property with certain values.
* '''`hlt-unhighlight-all-prop'''' -- Unhighlight highlighted propertized text.
* '''`hlt-mouse-toggle-link-highlighting'''' -- Alternately highlight and unhighlight links on a mouse click.
* '''`hlt-toggle-link-highlighting'''' -- Alternately highlight and unhighlight links.
* '''`hlt-mouse-toggle-property-highlighting'''' -- Alternately highlight and unhighlight propertized text on a mouse click.
* '''`hlt-toggle-property-highlighting'''' -- Alternately highlight and unhighlight propertized text.

As always for library ##highlight.el##, this "highlighting" can use property `mouse-face' instead of `face'. You could, for example, highlight, using `mouse-face', all text that has property `foo' -- or that has property `face', for that matter.


[:hlt-next-highlight]
[:hlt-previous-highlight]
If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use commands
'''`hlt-next-highlight'''' and '''`hlt-previous-highlight'''' to navigate
among highlights of a given face. (Bind these to, for instance, `S-C-n' and `S-C-p'.)

:: '''See Also:''' 
[[Icicles - Other Search Commands#SearchingTextProperties]] for other, more general ways to navigate among highlighted zones.

[:hlt-unhighlight-region]
[:hlt-unhighlight-region-for-face]
You can unhighlight the region/buffer or a regexp in the region/buffer using command
'''`hlt-unhighlight-region'''' or '''`hlt-unhighlight-regexp-region''''.  If you use overlay highlighting then 
you can use command
'''`hlt-unhighlight-region-for-face'''' to unhighlight the region/buffer for an
individual highlighting face -- other highlighting faces remain.

[:hlt-replace-face]
You can replace a highlighting face in the region/buffer by another,
using command '''`hlt-replace-highlight-face''''.  With a prefix
argument, property `mouse-face' is used, not property `face'.

[:hlt-highlight-single-quotations]
Command '''`hlt-highlight-single-quotations'''' highlights single-quoted text in the region.  For example, Emacs commands and keys between <code>`</code> and <code>'</code>: `foobar'.

[:hlt-mouse-face-each-line]
Command '''`hlt-mouse-face-each-line'''' puts a `mouse-face' property on each line of the region.








[:hlt-copy-props]
[:hlt-yank-props]
== Copy and Yank (Paste) Text Properties ==

You can highlight or unhighlight text by simply copying existing
highlighting (or lack of any highlighting) from anywhere in Emacs
and yanking (pasting) it anywhere else.

Put differently, you can copy and yank a set of text properties.
You can use these commands to copy and yank any text properties,
not just `face' or `mouse-face'.

To copy the text properties at a given position, use command
'''`hlt-copy-props''''.  You can then use command '''`hlt-yank-props'''' to
yank those properties to the active region anywhere.  If the set
of properties that you copy is empty, then yanking means
effectively ''removing all'' text properties.

User [[option]] '''`hlt-default-copy/yank-props'''' controls which text
properties to copy and yank, by default.  The default value of the
option includes only `face', which means that only property `face'
is copied and pasted.  That is typically what you want, for
highlighting purposes.  You can set the option value to any list of properties or to `t', meaning copy/yank all text properties present.

You can further control which text properties are copied or yanked
when you use the commands, by using a [[prefix argument]].  A plain or
non-negative prefix arg means copy or yank all available text
properties.  A negative prefix arg (e.g. `C--') means you are
prompted for which text properties to use, among those available.

For copying, the available properties are those among
`hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that are present at the copy
position.  For yanking, the available properties are those among
`hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that have previously (last) been copied.












== User Option `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag' ==

Library `highlight' generally acts only on faces that it controls,
that is, faces that you have explicitly asked it to use for
highlighting.  It sets the ''text property'' or ''overlay property''
'''`hlt-highlight'''' on such highlighted text, so that it can recognize
which faces it has responsibility for.

Sometimes, you might want to hide and show text other than that
controlled by library `highlight'.  Similarly, you might sometimes
want to navigate among faces other than those used for
highlighting.  You can control this using option
'''`hlt-act-on-any-face-flag'''', which you can toggle at any time using
command '''`hlt-toggle-act-on-any-face-flag''''.







== Hiding and Showing Text ==

You can hide and show text that you have highlighted.  You will
want to read the EmacsLisp manual (Elisp), section '''Invisible
Text''', to understand better what this entails.  In particular, you
should understand that for library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt>, hiding text
means adding the symbol naming the face to be hidden to both:

1. a text or overlay '''`invisible'''' property, making the text or
   overlay susceptible to being hidden by buffer-local variable
   `buffer-invisibility-spec', and

2. the buffer's '''`buffer-invisibility-spec'''', so that it in fact
   becomes hidden.

After text has been hidden this way, and unless the highlighting
as been removed completely by unhighlighting the text, the
`invisible' property of that text keeps the names of the faces
that have been applied to that text and hidden previously, even
after you show that text again.  Showing a hidden face simply
removes it from the `buffer-invisibility-spec'; it does not change
any `invisible' properties.

For example, if you hide face `foo' at some buffer position:

1. The `invisible' property of the text or overlay at that
   position is updated to include `foo'.  If there are no other
   faces that have been applied to this text and then hidden, the
   `invisible' property is just ##(foo)##.

2. `buffer-invisibility-spec' is also updated to include `foo'.
   This hides all text properties and overlay properties with
   `invisible' property `foo', throughout the buffer.  If there
   are no other invisible faces in the buffer, then
   `buffer-invisibility-spec' has value ##(foo)##.

If you then show face `foo' at that same buffer position, there is
no change to the `invisible' property.  `buffer-invisibility-spec'
is updated, by removing `foo': if it was ##(foo)##, it becomes ##()##.

[:hlt-choose-default-face]
There are several commands for hiding and showing highlighted
text.  The basic commands for hiding and showing are
'''`hlt-hide-default-face'''' and '''`hlt-show-default-face'''', which you can
use to hide and show the face last used for highlighting.  With a
prefix argument, you are prompted for a different face to hide; it
then becomes the default face for highlighting.  You can also
change the default highlighting face at any time using command
'''`hlt-choose-default-face''''.

The other hide and show commands depend on your also using
'''[[Icicles]]''', which is a set of libraries that offer enhanced
[[completion]].  The '''Icicles'''-dependent commands are the following:

  `hlt-choose-faces', `hlt-choose-invisible-faces',
  `hlt-choose-visible-faces', `hlt-hide', `hlt-hide-only',
  `hlt-show', `hlt-show-only'

These are all multi-commands (see [[Icicles - Multi-Commands]]), which means that they each let you
choose multiple completion candidates or all candidates that match
your current input (a regexp).  You can use command '''`hlt-hide'''' to
hide any number of visible faces.  Any text is hidden that has
that face as a text property or an overlay property, depending on
the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag'.

Command '''`hlt-show'''' is the opposite of `hlt-hide': it shows
invisible text that has the faces you choose.  Neither `hlt-hide'
nor `hlt-show' has any effect on other faces, besides those you
choose to hide or show, respectively; they each do only one thing,
hide or show.

Command '''`hlt-hide-only'''' hides the faces you choose, and shows all
other faces, and command '''`hlt-show-only'''' does the opposite.  You
can thus use these commands to specify exactly what faces should
be invisible and visible.  Empty input means none: If you choose
no faces to hide (that is, hit `RET' with an empty [[minibuffer]]),
then all faces are made visible; if you choose no faces to
show, then all are hidden.

Currently, face attributes for highlighting are combined when
overlays overlap, but the same is not true for text properties.
For example, if you highlight a word with face `foo', and then you
highlight it with face `bar', only `bar' remains as the face for
that word.  With overlays, the attributes of the two faces are
composed.  When you hide or show faces, this behavior difference
has an effect.

You can hide text using the commands in this library for any of
the purposes that you might use invisible text in Emacs.  This
gives you an easy, interactive way to control which sections of
text are seen by search and other Emacs tools.  Use the regexp
highlighting commands, for instance, to highlight text
syntactically, and then hide that highlighted text.  Or use
`hlt-highlighter' to sweep over text that you want to hide with
the mouse.

Hiding and showing faces also provides a "''conditional text''"
feature similar to that available in desktop publishing
applications such as Adobe Framemaker.  Publishers often use
such a feature to produce different output documents from the same
source document ("''single sourcing''").  You can use this feature
similarly, if you have an application (printing is one example)
that is sensitive to whether text is visible or invisible.  One
caveat: Emacs faces are not saved when you save your file.






[:WhatGetsHighlighted]
== What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type ==

Most mention of the "region" in this commentary should really say
"[[active region]] or [[buffer]]".  If the region is active and non-empty, then
only the text in the region is targeted by the commands in this
library.  This lets you easily control the scope of operations.

If the region is not active or it is empty, then:

- If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is `nil' and there is no prefix arg,
  then the face is applied to the ''next characters that you type''.

- Otherwise, the face is applied to the entire ''buffer'' (or the
  current restriction, if the buffer is narrowed).






[:PreservingHighlighting]
== Interference by Font Lock ==

If you use Emacs 22 or later, then you can use library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt> in
conjunction with library <tt>[[font-lock+.el]]</tt> (it is loaded
automatically, if available).  That prevents
font-locking from removing any highlighting face properties that
you apply using the commands defined here.

[If you also load library <tt>[[facemenu+.el]]</tt>, then the same applies to highlighting that you apply using the face menu (see FaceMenuPlus): that highlighting is also protected from interference by font lock.]

Otherwise, when `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is `nil', font-lock
highlighting interferes with the highlighting of this library.
In most cases, you can still highlight text, but sooner or
later font-lock erases that highlighting when it refontifies
the buffer.  If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is non-`nil', there is no
such problem : font-lock has no effect on overlays.






== Suggested bindings ==

Library `highlight' binds many of its commands to keys on the
[[prefix key]] '''`C-x X''''.  It also  adds menu items to the `Region'
submenu of the '''Edit''' menu-bar menu, if you have a '''Region'''
submenu.  To obtain this menu, load library <tt>[[menu-bar+.el]]</tt>.


Library `highlight.el' makes no other key bindings.  Here are some additional, suggested
bindings (`C-x y', `C-x mouse-2', `C-x S-mouse-2', `S-C-p', and
`S-C-n'):

 (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?y)]     'hlt-highlight)
 (define-key ctl-x-map [(down-mouse-2)]   'hlt-highlighter)
 (define-key ctl-x-map [(S-down-mouse-2)] 'hlt-eraser)
 (global-set-key [(shift control ?p)]     'hlt-previous-highlight) ; Emacs 21+
 (global-set-key [(shift control ?n)]     'hlt-next-highlight) ; Emacs 21+






== See Also ==

* <tt>[[highlight-chars.el]]</tt> -- Provides ways to highlight
different sets of characters, including whitespace and Unicode
characters.  See [[ShowWhiteSpace#HighlightChars|Highlight Characters]].

* The features of library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt> are complementary to those of the
vanilla Emacs library ##hi-lock.el##, so you can use the two
libraries together.  See also HighlightTemporarily for comparison with other libraries.







== Commands That Won't Work in Emacs 20 ==

The following commands and options work only for Emacs versions
more recent than Emacs 20:

  `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag', `hlt-choose-faces',
  `hlt-choose-invisible-faces', `hlt-choose-visible-faces',
  `hlt-hide', `hlt-hide-default-face', `hlt-hide-only',
  `hlt-next-highlight', `hlt-previous-highlight', `hlt-show',

== Discussion ==

[new]
I tried to use `hlt-highlight-regexp-region' (with default settings) in my Lisp program to highlight a non font-locking buffer by regexp. But it is 100x slower than while/re-search-forward/put-text-property version. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-03 14:52 UTC]
Such limited feedback is not helpful, unfortunately. Please send a proper bug report, with details. `hlt-highlight-regexp-region' does precisely the search and `put-text-property' that you mention, but it can also do more. Performance can only be discussed after some detailed analysis. Please look in more detail for where the apparent slowdown occurs. Thx. -- DrewAdams

[new:DrewAdams:2009-03-04 00:22 UTC]
What I meant by "analysis" was some attempt to try to see where performance is affected. That's the only way to help improve code performance.

Again, when text properties are used, the ##highlight.el## code does the ''same thing'' as yours: loop over `re-search-forward' + `put-text-property'.

Obviously, it is some of the other processing done that makes a difference here. That's the question. If all you need to do is a proper subset of what `hlt-highlight-regexp-region' does, then yes, it makes sense that a proper subset takes less time. If you only need to search for regexp matches and add text properties, then do only that, as you have done.

Anyway, FWIW, I've added the times I see to the right of yours, above, after '''`##|##''''. And here are some byte-compiled times I see, FWIW:
