There are at least 4 independently written major modes that handle COBOL source files.

----

The **most recent cobol-mode** is now available on ELPA and is the most up-to-date and featureful of the available cobol-modes. (It also available at [https://gist.github.com/Edward-H/6768e7dc53ea3dd2adca here].) It has:
* *syntax highlighting* for most modern COBOL dialects (in particular, COBOL 2014 and dialects supported by Micro Focus),
* (rudimentary) *code indentation*,
* code skeletons,
* rulers and basic formatting functions,
* and the ability to handle both free- and fixed-format code (using the M-x customize menu).

-------
Both the [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/cobol-mode.el cobol-mode here] and 
the [http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/nmcobol-mode.el nmcobol-mode here] are 
fairly new [circa 2005] and still a work-in-progress.  The first is for ANSI Cobol 
while the second is for TANDEM Cobol.  See TandemNskSupport for other 
TANDEM specific modes.

[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Rick_Bielawski I'm] writing these
because I didn't like the only other Cobol mode I could find.  I'm not a
COBOL programmer but can/must maintain such programs periodically.  I
believe comments and strings are being handled correctly and keyword
highlighting is starting to take shape.  Both versions are being
developed for Tandem/Guardian/NSK source files.  That is, for use with
Scobol and Tandem Cobol so these modes should handle the extensions
implemented by those compilers.  They may fail to correctly handle
features not implemented by those compilers.  Help appreciated.

For ?ANSI format:    Lisp:cobol-mode.el

For ?TANDEM format:  Lisp:nmcobol-mode.el

To install, put the .el file into a directory in your LoadPath and add
the appropriate lines to your ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'cobol-mode "cobol-mode" "A major mode for editing ANSI Cobol/Scobol files." t nil)
    (autoload 'NMCobol-mode "nmcobol-mode" "A major mode for editing Tandem format Cobol files." t nil)


When you are visiting a Cobol or Scobol source file you can use 'M-x
cobol-mode' or 'M-x nmcobol-mode' to activate the appropriate mode.

For best performance you should byte compile .el files but it's not required.  
A CompiledFile usually runs faster.  
There should be no warnings when compiling either file.  

See the TandemNskSupport page for a method of automatically recognizing
the language of Tandem files since they don't have an extension and
coders often can't stick a -*-cobol-*- comment in line 1.

*Another cobol-mode* (aka clomo).

You can find it on the Azundris site but I don't think it's a good idea
to put a link to it here.  It has a malicious bug that deletes periods
and commas somewhat randomly from your source.  I reported it and since
it wasn't fixed I worry that it is intentionally malicious.

You can fix the bug by changing the syntax properties of period and comma
in the mode's syntax table.  You may also need to comment out the line
(font-lock-unset-defaults) to make it work under GNU Emacs 22.0.50.  It
doesn't have anything close to
[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/cobol-mode.el my] version's
handling of comments and strings but it does do a great many things that
my new one doesn't.  After fixing it's syntax table a given individual
may decide either is the lesser of two evils.

----
There is another cobol.el from the (apparently defunct) *COBOL for
GCC* project.  See [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobolforgcc/ here].
It includes syntax highlighting.  It is based on a cobol.el dated June
21, 1988, which is itself based on a FORTRAN mode for Emacs.

Unfortunately this link seems to be broken (2006-12-26) and I'm unable to
locate any archive copies.  Perhaps such things should be dumped into the
gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup so Google will archive them for all eternity.
