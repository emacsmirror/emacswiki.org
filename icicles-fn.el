  `icicle-match-highlight-Completions', and

Use `\\[icicle-minibuffer-help]' during completion for more information on completion and key
bindings in Icicle mode.

PROMPT is a string to prompt with. It normally ends in a colon and a
space.  If PROMPT has non-nil text property `icicle-fancy-candidates'
on its first character, then completion candidates can be fancy - they
can have properties.  However, if all of the candidates would be
acceptable to vanilla Emacs, then PROMPT need not use property
`icicle-fancy-candidates', even for candidates that have text
properties.  Property `icicle-fancy-candidates' is needed only for
candidates that require encoding and decoding to store and retrieve
properties.  See the Icicles doc, section `Programming with Fancy
Candidates'.

COLLECTION is an obarray or an alist whose elements' cars are strings.
It can also be a function that performs the completion itself.
In Emacs 22 or later, it can also be a hash table or list of strings.

In Icicle mode, the car of an alist entry can also be a list of
strings.  In this case, the completion candidate is a
multi-completion.  The strings are joined pairwise with
`icicle-list-join-string' to form the completion candidate seen by the
user.  You can use variable `icicle-candidate-properties-alist' to
control the appearance of multi-completions in buffer `*Completions*'.
You can use variables `icicle-list-use-nth-parts' and
`icicle-list-nth-parts-join-string' to control the minibuffer behavior
of multi-completions.  See the Icicles documentation for more
information.

PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of COLLECTION.

See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details on
completion, COLLECTION, and PREDICATE.

REQUIRE-MATCH can take any of these values:
* nil means the user can exit using any input.
* t means the user can exit only if the input is (or completes to) an
  element of COLLECTION or is null.
* In Emacs 23 or later:
  - `confirm' means the user can exit with any input, but if the input
    is not an element of COLLECTION then confirmation is needed.
  - `confirm-after-completion' is similar, except that with
    non-matching input exit is allowed only just after completing.
* Anything else behaves like t, except that hitting `\\[exit-minibuffer]' does not
  exit if it performs non-null completion.

Regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH, if the user input is empty
then the function returns a string that is based on the value of DEF:

* DEF, if DEF is a string
* the first element of DEF, if DEF is a non-empty list
* the empty string, if DEF is nil

If option `icicle-require-match-flag' is non-nil, it overrides the
value of REQUIRE-MATCH.

If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
with point positioned at the end.  If it is (STRING . POSITION), the
initial input is STRING, but point is placed at zero-indexed position
POSITION in STRING.  (This is different from `read-from-minibuffer'
and related functions, which use one-indexing for POSITION.)

INITIAL-INPUT is considered deprecated by vanilla Emacs, but not by
Icicles.  If INITIAL-INPUT is nil and DEF is non-nil, the user can use
`next-history-element' to yank DEF into the minibuffer.

HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally the initial
position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the history list
variable to use, or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  If a
cons cell, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and HISTPOS is
the initial position (the position in the list used by the minibuffer
history commands).  For consistency, you should also specify that
element of the history as the value of INITIAL-INPUT.  Positions are
counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.  The variable
`history-length' controls the maximum length of a history list.

DEF, if non-nil, is the default value or (Emacs 23+ only) the list of
default values.  Option `icicle-default-value' controls the treatment
of the default value (or the first default value, if DEF is a list):
whether it is shown in the prompt, substituted for an empty
INITIAL-INPUT, and so on.  If `icicle-default-value' is t then option
`icicle-default-in-prompt-format-function' is used to format DEF for
its addition to PROMPT.

If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits the
current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.

Optional arg KEYMAP, if non-nil, should be a completion keymap to use.

Both completion candidates and DEF are filtered using these Icicles
variables:
  `icicle-must-match-regexp'
  `icicle-must-not-match-regexp'
  `icicle-must-pass-predicate'

Completion ignores case when `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil."

Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.
DIR should be an absolute directory name.  It defaults to the value of

Default the name to DEFAULT-FILENAME if user exits the minibuffer with
the same non-empty string that was inserted by this function.
 (If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted, the visited file name is used,
  but if INITIAL-INPUT is specified, that combined with DIR is used.)
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, this function returns
an empty string.  (This can only happen if the user erased the
pre-inserted contents or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)
Fourth arg REQUIRE-MATCH non-nil means require existing file's name.
 Non-nil and non-t means also require confirmation after completion.
Fifth arg INITIAL-INPUT specifies text to start with.
If optional sixth arg PREDICATE is non-nil, possible completions and
 the resulting file name must satisfy `(funcall predicate NAME)'.
 This argument is only available starting with Emacs 22.
Sixth arg HISTORY is an alternative minibuffer to use, instead of
 `file-name-history', which is used by default.  (HISTORY is not
 available for vanilla `read-file-name'.)

Both completion candidates and DEFAULT-FILENAME are filtered using
these Icicles variables:
  `icicle-must-match-regexp'
  `icicle-must-not-match-regexp'
  `icicle-must-pass-predicate'

Directory names are highlighted in `*Completions*' using face
`icicle-special-candidate'.

If option `icicle-require-match-flag' is non-nil, it overrides the
value of REQUIRE-MATCH.

If option `icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' is non-nil, then the
following proxy file-name candidates are included.  (This inclusion
can be toggled at any time from the minibuffer, using `C-M-_'.)

* `*mouse-2 file name*' - Click `mouse-2' on a file name to choose it.
* `*point file name*'   - Use the file name at point (cursor).
* Single-quoted file-name variables - Use the variable's value.

Candidates `*mouse-2 file name*' and `*point file name*' are available
only if library `ffap.el' can be loaded.  A file-name variable has
custom type `file' or (file :must-match t).

If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a file dialog box if
`use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X toolkit in use
provides a file dialog box.

  "Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an alternative to
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  Vanilla Emacs considers it to be obsolete, but
  Icicles does not.  It is discussed in more detail below.

Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use while reading;
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.

If fourth arg READ is non-nil, then interpret the result as a Lisp
  object and return that object.  In other words, return this:

   (car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))

Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
  history list variable to use, or it can be a cons cell
  (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  If a cons cell, HISTVAR is the history list
  variable to use and HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the
  minibuffer history commands.  For consistency, you should also
  specify that element of the history as the value of
  INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions are counted starting from 1 at the
  beginning of the list.

Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is a string, nil, or (for Emacs 23 and later)
  a non-empty list of strings.  The strings are available to the user
  as input via `\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]'.

  NOTE: Unlike a default-value parameter for some other functions such
  as `completing-read', if the user hits `RET' with empty input then
  DEFAULT-VALUE is NOT returned.  In that case, if READ is nil then
  the empty string, \"\", is returned.  If READ is non-nil then the
  DEFAULT-VALUE string (or the first string in DEFAULT-VALUE if
  DEFAULT-VALUE is a list) is read.

Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer
  inherits the current input method and the setting of
  `enable-multibyte-characters'.

If variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil then the
  string returned includes whatever text properties were present in
  the minibuffer.  Otherwise the return value has no text properties.

Option `icicle-default-value' controls how the default value,
DEFAULT-VALUE, is treated.

The remainder of this documentation string describes parameter
INITIAL-CONTENTS in more detail.

If non-nil, INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the
minibuffer before reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of
that string.  However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the
initial input is STRING and point is placed at one-indexed position
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  Note that this
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in
`completing-read' and some other functions, which use zero-indexing
for POSITION."

  "Return non-nil if VARIABLE satisfies one of the custom types in TYPES.
TYPES is a list of `defcustom' type sexps or a list of regexp strings.
TYPES are matched, in order, against VARIABLE's type definition or
VARIABLE's current value, until one is satisfied or all are tried.

If TYPES is a list of regexps, then each is regexp-matched against
VARIABLE's custom type.

Otherwise, TYPES is a list of type sexps, each of which is a
definition acceptable for `defcustom' :type or the first symbol of
such a definition (e.g. `choice').  In this case, two kinds of type
comparison are possible:

1. VARIABLE's custom type, or its first symbol, is matched using
  `equal' against each type in TYPES.

2. VARIABLE's current value is checked against each type in TYPES to
   see if it satisfies one of them.  In this case, VARIABLE's own type
   is not used; VARIABLE might not even be typed - it could be a
   variable not defined using `defcustom'.

For any of the comparisons against VARIABLE's type, either that type
can be checked directly or its supertypes (inherited types) can also
be checked.

These different type-checking possibilities depend on the value of
argument MODE, as follows, and they determine the meaning of the
returned value:

`direct':   VARIABLE's type matches a member of list TYPES
`inherit':  VARIABLE's type matches or is a subtype of a TYPES member
`value':    VARIABLE is bound, and its value satisfies a type in TYPES
`inherit-or-value': `inherit' or `value', tested in that order
`direct-or-value':  `direct' or `value', tested in that order
anything else (default): `inherit'

VARIABLE's current value cannot satisfy a regexp type: it is
impossible to know which concrete types a value must match."

  alternatively type the code point or the character to see what the
  name is.  You can complete the name or the code point, or both.

  `*Completions*' is shown, the current character and its code point

completion.

Return the strings read, as a list.

By using this functionality, you can specify multiple strings at a
single prompt, optionally using completion.

Most Icicles completions features are available, but because `TAB'
here performs `crm' completion it does not also cycle among completion
candidates.  You can, as always, use `down' to do that.

You specify multiple strings by separating the strings with a
prespecified separator regexp (separator character, prior to Emacs
24.3).  For example, if the separator regexp is \",\" then you specify
the strings 'alice', 'bob', and 'eve' as 'alice,bob,eve'.

The separator regexp is the value of variable `crm-separator', whose
default value is the value of `crm-default-separator'.

Contiguous strings of non-separator-characters are referred to as
\"elements\".  In the above example, the elements are 'alice', 'bob',
and 'eve'.

Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if your
input in the minibuffer is 'alice,bob,eve' and point is between the
'l' and the 'i', pressing `TAB' operates on element 'alice'.

If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,
insert output in current buffer.  (This cannot be done asynchronously.)
In either case, the output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).

If the command terminates without error, but generates output,
and you did not specify \"insert it in the current buffer\",
the output can be displayed in the echo area or in its buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
\(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.
Otherwise,the buffer containing the output is displayed.

If there is output and an error, and you did not specify \"insert it
in the current buffer\", a message about the error goes at the end
of the output.

If there is no output, or if output is inserted in the current buffer,
then `*Shell Command Output*' is deleted.

If the optional third argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER."

Normally, display any output in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';
Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of
COMMAND.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell command, use \\[universal-coding-system-argument]
before this command.  By default, the input (from the current buffer)
is encoded in the same coding system that will be used to save the file,
`buffer-file-coding-system'.  If the output is going to replace the region,
then it is decoded from that same coding system.

The noninteractive arguments are START, END, COMMAND,
OUTPUT-BUFFER, REPLACE, ERROR-BUFFER, and DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER.
Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.

If the command generates output, the output may be displayed
in the echo area or in a buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
\(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.  Otherwise
it is displayed in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.  The output
is available in that buffer in both cases.

If there is output and an error, a message about the error
appears at the end of the output.

If there is no output, or if output is inserted in the current buffer,
then `*Shell Command Output*' is deleted.

If the optional fourth argument OUTPUT-BUFFER is non-nil,
that says to put the output in some other buffer.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,
insert output in the current buffer.
In either case, the output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).

If REPLACE, the optional fifth argument, is non-nil, that means insert
the output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark
around it.

If optional sixth argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
If DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, display the error buffer if there
were any errors.  (This is always t, interactively.)  This argument is
not available before Emacs 22.

Completion is lax, so you can use any shell command you want, not
just a completion candidate, and you can edit the completed input to
add options and arguments etc.

In addition to file-name candidates, the following are combined to
produce extra completion candidates (which are indicated using face
`icicle-extra-candidates' in buffer `*Completions*'):

* If you use Dired X, then the rules defined by user option
  `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' and variable
  `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' provide candidates appropriate for
  the marked files in Dired.

* MIME-type associations provide candidates appropriate for the marked
  files (Emacs 23 and later), 

* If option `icicle-guess-commands-in-path' is non-nil, then
  executable files (or all files, if `shell-completion-execonly' is
  nil) in your search path provide candidates.

In addition, if `icicle-extra-candidates' is non-nil, its elements are
also included as extra candidates.

Help is available for individual candidates, using `C-M-RET',
`C-M-mouse-2', and so on.  For an extra candidate (that is, for a
shell command guessed to be appropriate), help is provided by the
`apropos' shell command (if available).  For a file name, help shows
