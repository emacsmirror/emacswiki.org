== Inserting Text Found Near the Cursor ==

Most of '''Icicles''' is about completing text that you type in the [[minibuffer]] against
some set of possible [[completion]] candidates.  This particular feature is
not.  It is related only in the sense that it is also about
inputting text that is already available elsewhere. If you want to get quickly into the heart of what '''Icicles''' is mainly about, then you can ''skip this page'' and come back later.

Some Emacs commands provide, as the ''default value'' for minibuffer
input, a word or other text at the [[cursor]] position (aka "[[point]]").  You
can insert this default value in the minibuffer with `M-n'.
'''Icicles''' [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-default-value|icicle-default-value]]</tt>'''' can be used to
automatically insert the default value into the minibuffer as an
initial value, if you prefer that optional behavior (I do; many people do not).

Sometimes you would like to use the text at the cursor, but the command
asking for input does not let you retrieve that text as the
default value.  For example, if the text at point is a file name,
you might like to use it with `C-x C-f' to open that file.  Or, if
the text is a URL, you might want to visit it using a Web browser.






[:ffap]
=== FFAP: Find File At Point ===

Some Emacs libraries, such as FindFileAtPoint (`##ffap.el##'), have as their specific purpose
to help you do this.  "Ffap" stands for `find-file-at-point', the
main command in that library.  It tries to interpret the text at
point and "do the right thing" with it: visit a file, open a URL
in a Web browser, and so on.

If you like, you can use library `##ffap.el##' with '''Icicles'''.  All
'''Icicles''' features are then available during file-name and URL
completion.  And if you like `##ffap.el##', you might also like to try
my extension library <tt>[[ffap-.el]]</tt>. However, if you use ffap with
'''Icicles''', you might not want to use the ffap [[key binding]]s,
preferring the '''Icicles''' bindings or the standard Emacs bindings for
keys such as `C-x C-f'.  (In that case, do not call function
`ffap-bindings'.)

'''Icicles''' provides a couple of simple ways to take advantage of `ffap-guesser', which is
the ffap function that guesses which string at the cursor position
you want to grab, without sacrificing any key bindings to ffap. One way is to use '''`##M-.##'''' (command `icicle-insert-string-at-point') at any
time in the minibuffer.  It grabs text at or near the cursor and
yanks it into the minibuffer.  One of the alternative types of thing it grabs is whatever text `ffap-guesser' guesses.





[:ProxyCandidates]

=== Proxy Candidates, `M-.' ===

Another way is to use one of the [[Icicles - Completions Display#ProxyCandidates|proxy completion candidates]] `##*point file name*##' or `##*mouse-2 file name*##' whenever Emacs asks you to input a file name (provided option
`icicle-add-proxy-candidates-flag' is non-`nil' -- toggle with
`##C-M-_##').  The former picks up the file name at [[point]], just like `##M-.##'. The latter lets you click a file name anywhere with `mouse-2' to pick up the name.

Using `##M-.##' or a proxy candidate on demand, instead of binding keys to ffap commands,
lets you control which [[buffer]] text you use as minibuffer input and
how that text should be interpreted (file name, URL, and so on).  You can change the behavior of `##M-.##' (which string-inserting functions are used) by customizing [[user option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-thing-at-point-functions|icicle-thing-at-point-functions]]</tt>''''.

'''See Also:''' [[Icicles - Completions Display#ProxyCandidates|Completions Display]] for more about using proxy candidates.







[:RepeatedM.]
=== Repeat `M-.' To Grab More or Different ===

Actually, `##M-.##' acts <u>differently if you **u**se it successively</u>.
Successive uses of `##M-.##' grab and insert either '''1''') alternative
bits of text (different text "things") or '''2''') successive bits of
text.  The default behavior is #1, but you can change this choice
by customizing option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-default-thing-insertion|icicle-default-thing-insertion]]</tt>'''' (setting it
to `more-of-the-same', instead of `alternatives').

As an example of grabbing successive bits of text (#2), suppose
that the cursor is at the beginning of the word "'''use'''" in the
previous paragraph.  Then, during minibuffer input, suppose that
you use `##M-. M-. M-.##'.  Each time you hit `##M-.##', another word is
inserted in the minibuffer:

  use
  use it
  use it successively
  ...

The rest of this section is a bit technical, so you might want to
''skip it'' if you are reading the '''Icicles''' doc for the first time.  It
details the behavior and definitions of options
`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-default-thing-insertion|icicle-default-thing-insertion]]</tt>' and
`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-thing-at-point-functions|icicle-thing-at-point-functions]]</tt>', and how to temporarily override
those settings interactively.

Option `<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-thing-at-point-functions|icicle-thing-at-point-functions]]</tt>' controls which text at or
near the cursor `##M-.##' inserts into the minibuffer.  It is a [[cons cell]], that is, an ordered pair:

* The ''[[car]]'' (first part) is a list of
functions that ''grab different kinds of strings'' at or near [[point]] (#1, above). Any number of
functions can be used.  They are used in sequence by `##M-.##'.
I recommend that you also use library <tt>[[thingatpt+.el]]</tt>, so that
`##M-.##' can take advantage of the string-grabbing functions it
defines.


* The ''[[cdr]]'' (second part) is a function that
advances point one text thing (#2, above).  Each time command `##M-.##' is used
successively, this is called to ''grab more things'' of text (of the
same kind).  The default function grabs successive ''words''.

If either the car or cdr is empty, then the other alone determines
the behavior of `##M-.##'.  Otherwise, option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-default-thing-insertion|icicle-default-thing-insertion]]</tt>'''' determines whether the car or the cdr
is used by `##M-.##'.

For example, if the value of `icicle-default-thing-insertion' is
'''`alternatives'''' (the default value), then repeated use of `##M-.##'  inserts
a different kind of thing at point each time.  By default, these are
the thing types, in order:

# `non-nil-symbol-name-nearest-point' (*) or `symbol-at-point'
# `word-nearest-point' (*) or the word at point
# `list-nearest-point-as-string', the first enclosing list (*)
# `list-nearest-point-as-string', the second enclosing list (*)
# `list-nearest-point-as-string', the third enclosing list (*)
# `ffap-guesser'
# `thing-at-point-url-at-point'

The alternatives marked with an asterisk (*) are available only if you
use library '''[[ThingAtPoint+]]'''.  Alternative `ffap-guesser' is used
only if you use library ##ffap.el##.

The first alternative inserts text that has the syntax of an
EmacsLisp ''[[symbol]]'' name.  In practice, this can also be a ''file''
name or a ''URL'' -- it can include characters such as  '''##-##''', '''##/##''', '''##+##''', '''##.##''', '''##:##''', '''##@##''', and '''##_##'''.

The second alternative inserts a ''word'', which includes letters,
'''##'##''', and '''##-##'''. 

The third, fourth, and fifth alternatives insert a (non-`nil')
list that is around point - three different enclosing levels.

The sixth alternative inserts whatever `ffap-guesser' returns: a
''file'' name or a ''URL'' at point.

The seventh alternative inserts a ''URL'' at point, adding prefix
`##http://##' if needed.

This means that you can quickly pick up a symbol name, a
list, a file name, or a URL at point.

If you use library '''[[ThingAtPoint+]]''' then the first two alternatives
pick up the symbol or word ''nearest'' point -- the cursor need not be
exactly on the symbol or word.

You can of course add to or replace any of the alternatives
that are provided by default.

If you set `icicle-default-thing-insertion' to
'''`more-of-the-same'''' instead of `alternatives', then repeated use of `##M-.##' inserts successive
words into the minibuffer, as shown in the example above.

You need not make a final choice once and for all between
`alternatives' and `more-of-the-same'.  You can also make an
interactive choice by using a [[prefix argument]] (`C-u') at any time
to override the value of `icicle-default-thing-insertion'.

If you use plain `C-u', then `##M-.##' flips the behavior specified by
`icicle-default-thing-insertion'.

If you
use a [[numeric prefix argument]] ''N'' (not just plain `C-u'), then:

* If `##M-.##' would normally grab the next thing of the same type,
then ''N'' such things are grabbed in succession.  If ''N'' is negative
then the things are grabbed successively from the left, not the
right.

* If `##M-.##' would normally grab an alternative thing of a different
type, then numeric ''N'' tells '''Icicles''' to grab the particular thing
at point and then evaluate it as a Lisp [[sexp]] and insert the
result of that evaluation in the minibuffer.

So for example, returning to the example above, with the cursor is
at the beginning of the word "use" in the first paragraph of this section,
if you used `##M-- M-. M-. M-.##', then the successive insertions in the example above would be as follows:

  differently
  differently if
  differently if you
  ...

And if you instead used `##M--3 M-.##', then you would immediately insert `##differently if you##'.

The use of a numeric prefix arg to evaluate a Lisp sexp does
require that you know when the particular thing-grabbing function
that you want is coming up next.  So if, for example, you want to
evaluate the [[active region]] and insert the resulting value, then
you use `##M-. C-9 M-.##', since (by default) it is the second `##M-.##'
that grabs the region text.

There are thus lots of possibilities when you use `##M-.##'
repeatedly.  You need not bother with them until you need them.
You can build up to using them all gradually.









[:ResolveFileNames]
=== Resolve File Names ===

Finally, something that is not directly related to the topic of
this page, but fits here as well as anywhere: you can use '''`C-x C-f'''' in the minibuffer to resolve a file name to its true,
absolute name.  Yes, that's the same key that is bound at top
level to `icicle-file' or `find-file' or whatever, but this is
about its use when you are already in the [[minibuffer]].

`C-x C-f' ('''`icicle-resolve-file-name''''), replaces a file name at or
near point (in the minibuffer) with its true, absolute name.  (For it to work ''near'' point, as well as ''at'' point, you need library <tt>[[thingatpt+.el]]</tt>.) If
the file name is relative, it first converts it to absolute (using
the default directory).  It then converts an absolute name that is
a symbolic link to its target name.  You can use this anytime in
the minibuffer, and you can use it on multiple parts of the same
minibuffer input (e.g. shell command arguments).
(This feature does not work for Emacs 20 or 21.)
