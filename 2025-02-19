The bots have been at it again!
For a while, load hovered around 80 to 110.
I switched off the site for a few hours.
Right now it's back up and some expensive requests that the bots like to use redirects to [https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots /nobots].
If this happens more than two times, fail2ban should ban the IP number for ten minutes.
If this happens more than three times, fail2ban should ban the IP number for a week.
Sadly, fail2ban doesn't ban the entire network, so all those rented machines the AI bros use to ingest the training data from sites like this one don't all get banned.
Oh well. For the moment it's yet another band aid.
Another cost they successfully offloaded to the human sysadmins out there.
I can't begin to tell you how much I hate these large language model fuckers.
I can spend more time optimizing my site or my software for them.
Change the architecture of the software that served me well for more than twenty years, for them.
Pay more money for RAM and start adding more caches, for them.
All to serve them the texts we wrote for each other, not for them.
