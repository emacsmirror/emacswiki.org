== Commentary ==

This library is based on [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/hide-region.el hide-region].
You can define areas of the buffer as "colour-regions" which can be toggled between various states,
e.g. for hiding or highlighting the text. Each colour-region can also contain several different texts which can be 
toggled between. 
I'm not sure how useful this is in practice, but it was fun to build.

== Creating colour-regions of different types ==
You can create a new colour-region by selecting an area of text in the buffer, and executing any of the following 
commands:

* colour-region-new
* colour-region-store-text
* colour-region-toggle-overlay
* colour-region-toggle-text

You can choose what type the new colour-region should have by using an appropriate prefix key,
e.g. using a prefix of C-3 will create a type 3 colour-region (which is green by default).
The colour and formatting for a particular type of colour-region can be customized using the `colour-region-formats' option. 
== Prefix keys for commands ==
For many of the commands you can choose which regions to apply them to by using the appropriate prefix key:

* No prefix key means apply the command to the colour-region nearest point.
* A prefix of 0 (i.e. pressing C-0 before entering the command) means apply the command to all colour-regions
in the current buffer.
* A positive non-zero prefix of say N means apply the command to all colour-regions of the Nth type
(that were created using the same prefix).
== Navigation ==
You can quickly move between colour regions using the following commands:

* colour-region-next 
* colour-region-previous 

Both of these commands take prefix arg to specify which colour-regions to consider when moving.
See the commands documentation for details.
== Copying/pasting/removing colour-reginos ==
Killed/copied colour-regions are stored in `colour-region-kill-ring'.
The following commands can be used for copying and pasting colour-regions.

* colour-region-remove
* colour-region-copy
* colour-region-kill
* colour-region-kill-ring-rotate
* colour-region-yank
* colour-region-yank-pop

The remove/copy/kill commands accept the previously mentioned prefix keys to specify with regions they apply to.
See the commands documentation for details.
== Altering colour-regions ==
The following commands can be used to alter the content and display format of colour-regions:

* colour-region-toggle-overlay
* colour-region-toggle-text
* colour-region-change-comment
* colour-region-change-type
* colour-region-store-text
* colour-region-func

All of these commands accept the previously mentioned prefix keys for specifying which regions they apply to.
See the commands documentation for details.
== Saving colour-regions ==
These commands can be used for loading and saving colour-regions.

* colour-region-load 
* colour-region-save

== Customizable options ==
The following options can be customized:

* colour-region-formats : List of text-properties to apply to the different states of each region type.
* colour-region-save-on-kill : Whether or not to save colour-regions when buffer is killed.
* colour-region-load-on-find-file : If set to t then always load colour-regions when a new file is opened.
* colour-region-kill-ring-max : The maximum number of elements allowed on the colour-region-kill-ring before old ones are removed.

See the doc strings for more details.
== Hooks ==
The following hook functions are used to load/save colour regions automatically. 
They are added to the relevant hooks when colour-region-initialize is run.

* colour-region-find-file-hook 
* colour-region-kill-emacs-hook 
* colour-region-kill-buffer-hook

== Installation ==

* If you have [http://www.marmalade-repo.org/ marmalade-repo.org], this colour-region is part of the emacs packages you can install.  
Just type M-x package-install colour-region marmalade 
* Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:colour-region.el, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, 
like ~/.emacs.d
* Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:

(require 'colour-region)
(colour-region-initialize)
