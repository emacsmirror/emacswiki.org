[[http://nodejs.org/|Node-JS]] is an asynchronous TCP programming framework using JavaScript. There are several modes for running node.js inside of Emacs:

== Using comint mode ==

The simplest method is to just use Emacs's Comint mode: 

    (defun node-repl () (interactive)
      (pop-to-buffer (make-comint "node-repl" "node" nil "--interactive"))
    (node-repl)

== Using js-comint ==

"The simplest way to have node.js (tested using node v0.8.1) as an inferior shell under Emacs is to use the [[http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/|js-comint package]]. Then, set <code>(setq inferior-js-program-command "node --interactive")</code> to force node to run in interactive mode. The command <code>M-x run-js</code> will then open the interpreter." -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8909836/how-to-run-node-js-interactively-in-emacs-on-windows

If you start a repl using "js-run", you can then later send code to the repl using "js-send-region".

NOTE: tab-completion doesn't work

Also tested on Win7, Emacs 24 and node.js 0.10.5. Size: 7KB

Check https://github.com/redguardtoo/js-comint for latest version. old version 0.0.1 has some compatibility issue with node.js
== Using nodejs-repl ==

* TAB completion same as Node.js REPL 
** NOTE: I locked up Emacs 24 on Win 7 attempting tab-completion on an array. YMMV. --MichaelPaulukonis
* file name completion in string 
* incremental history search

== Using SwankJs ==

see SwankJs for details.

What are the advantages to using SwankJs?

There's still no tab-completion.

== Using nodejs-mode ==

There is a [[https://github.com/abicky/nodejs-mode.el|node.js mode]]. As of 2013-04-15 it has not been updated for Node.js 0.8 or later.

[new:OtherMichael:2013-04-28 19:59 UTC]Question: But does it still work with newer versions of node.js ?

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-04-30 14:35 UTC] I tested this on 2013.04.29 with Win7, Emacs 24 and node.js 0.10.5. A shell is opened, once something is sent to node node is actually launched, but Emacs does not respond to any more input until I kill the node process externally.
