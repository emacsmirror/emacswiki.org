[[http://nodejs.org/|Node-JS]] is a Javascript runtime enviroment, popular for making async web and TCP servers. There are several modes for running node.js inside of Emacs:

== Using comint mode ==

The simplest method is to just use Emacs's Comint mode: 

    (defun node-repl () (interactive)
      (setenv "NODE_NO_READLINE" "1") ;avoid fancy terminal codes
      (pop-to-buffer (make-comint "node-repl" "node" nil "--interactive")))
    (node-repl)

== Using js-comint ==

"The simplest way to have node.js as an inferior shell under Emacs is to use the [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/js-comint|js-comint package]]. The command <code>M-x run-js</code> will then open the interpreter."

If you start a repl using "js-comint-repl", you can then later send code to the repl using "js-comint-send-region". (Please note original commands like `js-run` and `js-send-region` are alias of new `js-comint-xxxx` commands).

== Using nodejs-repl ==

* TAB completion same as Node.js REPL 
** NOTE: I locked up Emacs 24 on Win 7 attempting tab-completion on an array. YMMV. --MichaelPaulukonis
* file name completion in string 
* incremental history search
* sending JavaScript codes to REPL
* File to get C-x C-e to work: [https://gist.github.com/emallson/0eae865bc99fc9639fac]  
   * requires js2-mode

== Using SwankJs ==

see SwankJs for details.

What are the advantages to using SwankJs?

There's still no tab-completion.

== Using nodejs-mode ==

There is a [[https://github.com/abicky/nodejs-mode.el|node.js mode]]. As of 2013-04-15 it has not been updated for Node.js 0.8 or later.

[new:OtherMichael:2013-04-28 19:59 UTC]Question: But does it still work with newer versions of node.js ?

[new:MichaelPaulukonis:2013-04-30 14:35 UTC] I tested this on 2013.04.29 with Win7, Emacs 24 and node.js 0.10.5. A shell is opened, once something is sent to node node is actually launched, but Emacs does not respond to any more input until I kill the node process externally.
