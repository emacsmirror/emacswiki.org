 <johnw> pymacs lets you use python functions and data in Elisp, 
	 and vice versa
 <johnw> you can do (pymacs-load "os") and then call (os-stat FILE), 
         for example

Update 2018/07/16 - Pymacs has moved to https://github.com/dgentry/Pymacs.  Further pointers to releases, etc., are in the README there.  Note that the URL in the message below is obsolete.

 Hi!  A new release of Pymacs is available as:
 
    http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs/Pymacs.tar.gz
 
 Pymacs allows Emacs users to extend Emacs using Python, where they might have
 traditionally used Emacs LISP.  Pymacs runs on systems having sub-processes.
 
 The oldish `import pymacs; from pymacs import lisp' interface is gone.
 The usual interface is definitely `from Pymacs import lisp'.  The `setup'
 script has been reduced even more, it now only takes care of installing the
 Emacs Lisp side of Pymacs.  The Distutils `setup.py' script does the rest.
 So, the `-P', `-b', `-p' and `-x' options of `setup' are gone.  Syver also
 gave me a few hints about how to modify `setup' for Win32 systems.
 
 Some tuning was needed for Python 2.2 hexadecimal escape sequences, which
 Emacs does not grok in some cases.  This is the reason for this release.

You can find Pymacs at http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/
