[[ja:アウトラインモード]]
Outline mode is the default outline mode for Emacs.  Use <tt>M-x outline-mode</tt> to enter it.  See also OutlineMinorMode, AllOut.

It distinguishes between different header levels and the plain text.  The default mechanism uses asterisks to determine header levels.  Use the NEWS file as an example (C-h n):

    * Very important
    ** Less important
    *** A detail
    And the rest is text
    between the headers.

You can then use Headings, Show, and Hide menus to selectively show parts of the text, or the following keys:

* C-c @ C-a show all
* C-c @ C-t show only the headings
* C-c @ C-s show subtree at cursor location
* C-c @ C-d hide subtree at cursor location

See also [[Manual:Outline Mode]].
Screencasts for using the outline-mode is available at ScreencastSources and ScreencastRecordings.

== Example ==

For example, a document may look like this:

  * Heading
  
  This is a document that has a heading, and a body.
  The body will consist of two paragraphs with sub-headings.
  
  * Body
  
  This is an introduction to the body. The body has two sub-headings,
  each of which have their own paragraph.
  
  ** The First Paragraph
  
  This is the first of two paragraphs.
  It is not terribly impressive.
  
  ** The Second Paragraph
  
  This is the second of two paragraphs.
  It is not impressive either.

You can use hide-subtree (C-c C-d) to hide the Heading, and the two paragraphs:

  * Heading...
  
  * Body
  
  This is an introduction to the body. The body has two sub-headings,
  each of which have their own paragraph.
  
  ** The First Paragraph...
  
  ** The Second Paragraph...

You can use hide-body (C-c C-t) to hide all the body text, leaving only the headings (note the ellipsis indicating where body text has been hidden):

  * Heading...
  
  * Body...
  ** The First Paragraph...
  ** The Second Paragraph...

And you can use show-all (C-c C-a) to redisplay everything and get back to where we started.

== Customizing Heading Definition ==

You can also customize `outline-regexp' which indicates which lines are considered heading.  It is a regular expression to match the beginning of a heading.  The smaller the match, the higher the level of the heading.

The default value matches asterisks and page breaks:

 "[*\f]+"

For lisp-modes, the value matches comments starting with three semicolons and opening parens on the first column.

 ";;; \\|(...."

For man pages, something like this might be useful:

 " *[A-Z ]+"

For [http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia] or [http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/ txt2tags] style headers:

 "^[=]+"

JohanBockgård uses "[A-Z]\\|\\s-+[-+]" to give this result

OPTIONS...

     -help   This causes xterm to print  out  a  verbose  message...

     -132    Normally, the VT102  DECCOLM  escape  sequence  that...

== Customizing Outline ellipsis ==

It isn't very obvious how to change the characters outline
mode uses for ellipsis (`...' by default).

Use this to customize it to your needs:

 (set-display-table-slot standard-display-table 
                         'selective-display 
                         (string-to-vector "More..."))

/Even/ less obvious is how to use a different [[Face]]:

    (set-display-table-slot
     standard-display-table
     'selective-display
     (let ((face-offset (* (face-id font-lock-keyword-face) (expt 2 19))))
       (vconcat (mapcar (lambda (c) (+ face-offset c)) "More..."))))

or (tested with emacs 23):

    (set-display-table-slot
     standard-display-table
     'selective-display
     (let ((face-offset (* (face-id 'shadow) (lsh 1 22))))
       (vconcat (mapcar (lambda (c) (+ face-offset c)) " [...] "))))

== Using Roman Numerals as Headings ==

Here's how to make Emacs' outline mode use "I., A., 1., a., i." and so on as valid outline entries.  Put the following at the end of your document (or among your LocalVariables if you already have them):

    Local Variables:
    mode: outline-minor
    outline-regexp: " *\\([A-Za-z]\\|[IVXivx0-9]+\\)\\. *"
    End:

There, now you can use normal outline notation.  If you use "outline" instead of "outline-minor" for mode, then you get font-lock as a bonus (but you lose whatever major mode you were in before).  Note that it is looking for any number of spaces, followed by either a single letter or a Roman or Arabic numeral (multiple digits allowed), followed by any number of spaces, and the length of all of that together determines the outline level.  So your outlines have to look like this:

      I.  blah blah
     II.  blah blah blah
    III.  blah blah
          A.  This
          B.  That

...for this to work correctly.  Interestingly enough, this didn't work for me on the very first line of the file; I had to skip one line (an extra carriage return above "I"), then it worked as planned.  Not sure why this is.

== Some hooks for special modes ==

 (add-hook 'change-log-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq outline-regexp "[[:digit:]]+")))
 ; note that the "^" is *implicit* at the beginning of the regexp

Better use (set (make-local-variable 'outline-regexp) "...") as the above changes the global value.

== Cycling ==

Instead of using many different commands to show and hide buffer
parts, `outline-cycle' cycles through the most important states of an
outline buffer.  By default, it is bound to the `TAB' key.  This saves a
lot of typing and thinking while editing your outline.

OrgMode includes cycling and many more features

The outline-magic package by CarstenDominik provides the command
`outline-cycle' which cycles the visibility / folding level of text and headings.

In addition to outline cycling, this extension provides four commands
for structure editing.  Using M-up, M-down, M-left, and M-right, you
can easily move entries around:

                               move up
                                  ^
                      promote  <- + ->  demote
                                  v
                              move down

You can get it from one of the following:
* http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/outline-magic.el
* http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/outline-magic.el

It seems that similar features are provided by AllOut.

You can use outline-magic to fold python code:

== Converting Emacs Outline to Other Formats ==

Outline mode is helpful for organizing plain text documents and program
source code.  It would be useful to have a converter for
the Emacs outline format into other document and file formats.
Here are a few projects trying to do just that.

* EasyCodeOutline
* EmacsOutlineToHtml - Converts the outline format to a web page.
* EmacsPresentation - Converts outline to some useful format for public presentations.

== Printing Outline files with a2ps ==

**a2ps(1)** includes a simple stylesheet for outline-mode (at least, the Debian package 1:4.13b-4.3 has it (not for me?, does anyone know where to find this?)).  To use it for your file, do one of:

* specify the language directly, e.g. <code>a2ps -o print.ps -Eoutline myfile</code>
* find or create some **magic(5)** for the **file(1)** command to recognise outline files, then tell the a2ps map file about the output signature

Note that it only understands the default '*' headings.

For me, the following a2ps style sheet (outline.ssh) does highlight the headers:

    # Style sheet for outline 

    style outline is 
    version is 0.1
    requires a2ps 4.13
    
    sequences are
      /^\\*/ Label_strong,
      /^\\*\\*+/ Label
    end sequences

    end style
 

== Vim-type outline marker ==

Vim editor has several different outlining (called folding) options. One of them is manual outlining in which user inserts predefined markers to the text and the outline level is determined by the markers. The default markers are <code>{{{</code> and <code>}}}</code> for starting and ending a fold. A number after the marker determines the outline level (e.g., <code>{{{1</code>, <code>{{{2</code>, <code>{{{3</code> and so on).

The following code adds an interactive function `set-vim-foldmarker' which can be used to set Vim-type opening outline marker for the current buffer.

<pre>
(defun set-vim-foldmarker (fmr)
  "Set Vim-type foldmarkers for the current buffer"
  (interactive "sSet local Vim foldmarker: ")
  (if (equal fmr "")
      (message "Abort")
    (setq fmr (regexp-quote fmr))
    (set (make-local-variable 'outline-regexp)
         (concat ".*" fmr "\\([0-9]+\\)"))
    (set (make-local-variable 'outline-level)
         `(lambda ()
            (save-excursion
              (re-search-forward
               ,(concat fmr "\\([0-9]+\\)") nil t)
              (string-to-number (match-string 1)))))))
</pre>

While in outline-mode or outline-minor-mode you can call this interactively with `M-x set-vim-foldmarker' and enter the opening marker when asked. If you use outline-minor-mode and Vim-type outlining always with certain major mode you can add the following lines to the appropriate major mode hook:

<pre>
(outline-minor-mode 1)
(set-vim-foldmarker "{{{")
</pre>
