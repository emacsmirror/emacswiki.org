On the configuration step:
```
;; Configure
M-x customize-group znc RET
```

I am adding my ZNC server, but what do I add for `network slug`? the default value is `network-slug`.

Just as a clarification, I figured it out. I couldn't find the definition for "network-slug" anywhere, but in this context, we should add the URL of our IRC network (ie irc.freenode.net)
