[[fr:Tailler des Frames Automatiquement]]

'''This page is part of the description of OneOnOneEmacs, by DrewAdams.'''

One advantage a [[Frame]] has over an Emacs [[Window]] is that the frame can
be made to fit the buffer it displays. With windows, this wouldn't
make much sense, since multiple windows tiled in the same direction
(in the same frame) have the same width or height. (You can vary the
height or width of ''all'' windows tiled in the same direction, but
even that is not very natural.)

This is not only possible for frames, it is also very useful. It means
that most buffers need ''never be displayed with wrap-around or
truncated text''. And a frame need ''never be larger than what is
needed'' to display its buffer.

== Command `fit-frame' ==

Command `fit-frame' "shrink-wraps" a frame to fit its displayed buffers or just its selected buffer -- always within the limits imposed by the maximum-size user options (see below). Its behavior depends on the prefix argument, if any, that you use:

*  No prefix arg means to use ''all of the buffers'' displayed in the frame to compute its size.

* A plain prefix arg (just `C-u') means to use only the ''selected buffer'' in the frame to compute the frame size. The resulting frame size would fit that buffer if it were the only one shown.

* A non-negative numeric prefix arg (not plain `C-u') means that you will
be ''prompted'' for the new frame width and height.

* A negative prefix arg means to use the current value of
`fill-column', plus `fit-frame-fill-column-margin', for the new frame
width. The frame height is not changed.

'''Goldilocks And The 3 Frames --''' Here are some screenshots:
* Frame that is too wide and too short:
: [[image:DrewsEmacsShrinkWide]]
* Frame that is too narrow and too tall:
: [[image:DrewsEmacsShrinkNarrow]]
* Frame that fits just right -- the result of command `fit-frame':
: [[image:DrewsEmacsShrinkFit]]

The resulting size is
determined automatically by `fit-frame', but there are user variables that give you control over this calculation. Alternatively, with a non-negative numeric prefix argument, `fit-frame' prompts you for an absolute width and height. A negative prefix argument uses the value of `fill-column'
for the width.

[:AutoFitFrames]
== Automatically Fitting All Frames ==

Because I found this so useful, I decided to apply shrink-wrapping ''automatically, by default, to all frames''. To do this, the first step was just to use `fit-frame' as a hook function,
whenever a frame is ''created'':

  (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)

This takes care of fitting normal, user-created frames at their
creation, but what about when a different buffer is displayed in an
existing frame? Other changes I made (see below) modified Emacs
behavior to use frames generally, instead of Emacs windows. To get
Emacs to fit all frames whenever appropriate, I redefined a few
important functions so that they called `fit-frame' at the appropriate time.

Each of these functions was changed to fit the frame if the
buffer's window is the only one in it:
* `pop-to-buffer'
* `display-buffer'
* `switch-to-buffer'
* `Info-find-node'
* `special-display-popup-frame'
* `occur'

I also added function `fit-frame-if-one-window' to `temp-buffer-show-hook'. This hook (undocumented in Emacs 20) is used by a few standard Emacs functions; for example,
`pp-eval-expression'. (Function `fit-frame-if-one-window' calls `fit-frame' if the frame has only one window.)


== User Variables for Frame Fitting ==

Having done this, I created various user variables to turn automatic frame fitting on/off. 

In a few cases, I used these variables to inhibit inappropriate frame fitting in standard Emacs functions. For example, in function `compile-internal', which performs a `make' or `grep' operation and displays the results of the process, I temporarily reset option
'''`fit-frame-inhibit-fitting-flag'''' to inhibit premature
fitting of the output buffer frame by `display-buffer'.

  (let ((fit-frame-inhibit-fitting-flag t)) (display-buffer outbuf))

Another useful user option for frame-fitting is '''`fit-frame-skip-header-lines-alist''''. It takes care of modes, such as InfoMode and DiredMode, that have headers that are sometimes much wider than the rest of the buffer. You use this option to tell `fit-frame' to ignore header lines when calculating the buffer width. The result is a better fit: a narrower frame with less empty space at the right -- the long header lines are wrapped.

The remaining user options for frame-fitting are described in the doc string of command `fit-frame'. Widths are in characters; heights are in lines.

* '''`fit-frame-empty-width'''', '''`fit-frame-empty-height'''' -- Width and height of new empty frames.

* '''`fit-frame-empty-special-display-width'''', '''`fit-frame-empty-special-display-height'''' -- Same thing, but for special-display frames.

* '''`fit-frame-min-width'''', '''`fit-frame-min-height'''' -- Minimum width and height for frames. The actual minimum is at least this and `window-min-width'.

* '''`fit-frame-max-width-percent'''', '''`fit-frame-max-height-percent'''' -- Maximum percent of the width of your display to use for a frame. These are used only if `fit-frame-max-width' and `fit-frame-max-height' are `nil' (the default).  By default, the maximum frame width is 94 percent of your display width, and the maximum frame height is 82 percent of your display width.

* '''`fit-frame-max-width'''', '''`fit-frame-max-height'''' -- Maximum width and height for frames. Leave these set to `nil' unless you want to override the automatic calculation of the maximum size based on your display size.

* '''`fit-frame-fill-column-margin'''' -- When you use a negative prefix arg with `fit-frame', the frame width is this plus `fill-column'. Depending on the average word length of the language used in the selected window,
you may need different values for this.  This is buffer-local.


'''See Libraries:'''
* Lisp:fit-frame.el and Lisp:autofit-frame.el provide the frame-fitting functionality ("shrink-wrapped" frames). Lisp:fit-frame.el also has commands, in Windows, for maximizing and restoring a frame. 
* Lisp:frame-cmds.el has commands for ''incrementally'' resizing a frame (by pressing arrow keys and `C-M-').
* Lisp:zoom-frm.el has commands for zooming a frame in and out.
* Lisp:doremi-frm.el has commands for incrementally resizing a frame with the arrow keys or mouse wheel.
