{I sent this only to fischer, but then saw the complicated answer and
figured I'd post...}

   Does anyone out there have a keybinding defintion that will insert
   the current time or date along with an identification string at the
   current point.  For example, I would like to type "M-x date" or define
   that to a keystroke and it would insert.

What emacs? I have code for GNUemacs, M-x stardate, which gives me a
very compact form: [eichin:19880908.1807EST] The code follows;
however, for what you want (in GNU) you could just do:

(defun date () 
  "Insert a date label into the current buffer"
  (interactive)
  (insert (current-time-string) " -- " (user-full-name)))

(the second line is what happens when you run M-x date.) Note that
this is *MUCH* faster than actually forking a date subprocess, even if
you add elisp code to format the date. (I did use that solution once,
but needed the speed and came up with this one...)
  I keep stardate bound to ^X^J, and use it to mark comments in code...
