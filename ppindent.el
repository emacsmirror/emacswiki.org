;;; Commentary:

;; PPINDENT indents C-preprocessor statements depending on the current
;; #if..., #el.., #endif level. It only modifies lines with "#" as the
;; first non-blank character and therefore does not conflict with the
;; normal C indentation. Unlike a true indent, it inserts the
;; requisite number of spaces after, rather than before the "#"
;; character. This type of preprocesor indent is commonly used to
;; provide the most compatibility with different C-compilers.
;;
;; Example:

;;        #ifdef WOO
;;        ....
;;        #if defined(X) && !defined(Y)
;;        #ifdef Q8
;;        ...
;;        #else
;;        ...
;;        ....
;;        #elif defined (Z)
;;        ....
;;        #endif
;;        #endif
;;        #endif
          
;; After "M-x ppindent-c" becomes:
          
;;        #ifdef WOO
;;        ....
;;        #  if defined(X) && !defined(Y)
;;        #    ifdef Q8
;;        ...
;;        #    else
;;        ...
;;        ....
;;        #    elif defined (Z)
;;        ....
;;        #    endif
;;        #  endif
;;        #endif

;; Two functions are provided: PPINDENT-C indents as described
;; above. PPINDENT-H does not indent the first level, assuming that
;; .h/.hpp files use an #ifdef guard around the entire file.

;; You can customize PPINDENT-INCREMENT if you want to use something
;; other than 2 spaces for the indent.
