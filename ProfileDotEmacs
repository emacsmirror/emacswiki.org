For a different package that will let you profile your Emacs config without restarting, see [https://github.com/jschaf/esup The Emacs Startup Profiler (ESUP)].

== profile-dotemacs Description ==

Here's some code to easily profile your Emacs InitFile (or any other
script-like Emacs Lisp file, for that matter).

It will go over all sexp's (balanced expressions) in the file and
run them through `benchmark-run'.  It will then show the file with
overlays applied in a way that let you easily find out which sexp's
take the most time.  Since time is relative, it's not the absolute
value that counts but the percentage of the total running time.

* All sexp's with a percentage greater than
   `profile-dotemacs-low-percentage' will be preceded by a
   highlighted line, showing the results from `benchmark-run'.
   Also, the more 'reddish' the background of the sexp, the more
   time it needs.

* All other sexp's will be grayed out to indicate that their
  running time is miniscule.  You can still see the benchmark
  results in the minibuffer by hovering over the sexp with the
  mouse.

Example:

You can only benchmark full sexp's, so if you wrapped large parts
of your init file in some conditional clause, you'll have to remove
that for getting finer granularity.

== Usage ==

Start emacs as follows:

<code>
emacs -Q -l PATH/profile-dotemacs.el -f profile-dotemacs
</code>

with PATH being the path to where this file resides.

The specific file to be profiled (i.e. ~/.emacs) is hardcoded within profile-dotemacs.el as follows:

<code>
(defvar profile-dotemacs-file "~/.emacs"
  "File to be profiled.")
</code>
