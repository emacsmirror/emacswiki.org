== The syntax table ==

One of Emacs' strengths is the way it matches parentheses.  Depending
on what mode the buffer is in, different things are considered to be
parentheses; for example, in Emacs Lisp mode, hitting "(" followed by
")" will briefly highlight the open parenthesis if it is visible on
screen, and if it is not visible, it will print a message in the echo
area showing you the context of the open that you just closed.  (This
is the default behavior; you or your site manager can change the
default.)

Nearly all modes support "(,)" as parentheses, and most also support
square brackets "[,]" and curly brackets "{,}".  However, you can make
any pair of characters a parenthesis-pair, by using the following
command:

    (modify-syntax-entry ?^ "($")
    (modify-syntax-entry ?$ ")^")

The first command modifies the current EmacsSyntaxTable to make "^" an
open parenthesis, to be matched to "$".  The second command does the
opposite.  You can modify a specific EmacsSyntaxTable like this:

    (modify-syntax-entry ?^ "($" perl-mode-syntax-table)

This adds <tt>^</tt> as an open parenthesis matching <tt>$</tt> in
perl mode's syntax table.  You could add that statement to your .emacs
file along with the corresponding closed parenthesis statement.

You can remove a pair of delimiters, just by redefining
them as words constituents or punctuation characters.
For example, if you want the command <code>forward-sexp</code>, bound
by default to <code>C-M-f</code>, to ignore the meaning of [ and ]
as parenthesis delimiters, put the following in your InitFile:

  (defvar my-wacky-syntax-table
      (let ((table (make-syntax-table)))
        (modify-syntax-entry ?[ "w" table)
        (modify-syntax-entry ?] "w" table)
        table))
  
  (global-set-key "\C-\M-f" '(lambda ()
           (interactive)
           (with-syntax-table my-wacky-syntax-table (forward-sexp))))

You can make <code>my-wacky-syntax-table</code> available to all commands by
using:

  (set-syntax-table my-wacky-syntax-table)

Note that opening delimiters can be matched in regular expressions
with <code>\s(</code>. For closing delimiters, use <code>\s)</code>

== Working with balanced expressions ==

A balanced expression is an expression starting with an opening delimiter,
and ending with the matching closing delimiter, given by the syntax table.
Such expression is called a <code>sexp</code>. Strings, symbols and numbers
are also often considered as sexp, depending on the current mode.

Here are a number of shortcuts for dealing with sexp:

  C-M-f     Move forward over a balanced expression

  C-M-b     Move backward over a balanced expression

  C-M-k     Kill balanced expression forward

  C-M-SPC   put the mark at the end of the sexp.

Here is a short example; let us consider the following sexp in text mode:

    (with-current-buffer "foo.tex" (insert " \\emph{first chapter} "))

If the cursor is before the first parenthesis, <code>C-M-f</code> puts it
right after the last parenthesis. With cursor on the word current, 
<code>C-M-f</code> puts it at the end of the word <code>buffer</code>. 
If cursor is on the first " character, <code>C-M-f</code> puts it just
 in front of the . character. Indeed, " is not an open delimiter, 
so the cursor only moves forward one word. 
The { character howewer is recognized as a delimiter and the 
cursor will jump just after the corresponding }.

Now if we want to remove the second parenthesized group, when the cursor
is on the parenthesis at the beginning of this group, we just type 
<code>C-M-k</code>. If we want to put it in the kill ring without removing
it, we first type <code>C-M-SPC</code>, followed by <code>M-w</code>. 
We can then yank it somewhere else with the usual command <code>C-y</code>.


== Navigating Parenthesis groups ==

Note that there are corresponding shortcuts to deal with parenthesis groups
only:

  C-M-n  Move forward over a parenthetical group 

  C-M-p  Move backward over a parenthetical group 

These commands see nothing but parentheses (according to the syntax table;
{} are considered as parentheses in text-mode for example). 

Let us return to the example of the previous section. With  cursor
on the word <code>current</code>, 
<code>C-M-f</code> puts it at the end of the word buffer, because 
<code>with-current-buffer</code> is considered as an sexp in text-mode.
On the other hand, <code>C-M-n</code> puts the cursor in front of the 
last parenthesis. That is, the cursor jumped over the next parenthesis group,
given by <code>(insert " \\emph{first chapter} ")</code>.

 

== vi emulation of the % command ==

This code from http://emacro.sourceforge.net/  gives a vi-like way of moving
over parenthesis groups. I bind it to C-%, from vi heritage. 
(Note M-% searches and replaces)
<pre>
(defun goto-match-paren (arg)
  "Go to the matching parenthesis if on parenthesis, otherwise insert %.
vi style of % jumping to matching brace."
  (interactive "p")
  (cond ((looking-at "\\s\(") (forward-list 1) (backward-char 1))
        ((looking-at "\\s\)") (forward-char 1) (backward-list 1))
        (t (self-insert-command (or arg 1)))))
</pre>


=== Another method for vi emulation of the % command ==

You could also bind a modified version of the above command to the "%" key:

<pre>
(defun goto-match-paren (arg)
  "Go to the matching parenthesis if on parenthesis AND last command is a movement command, otherwise insert %.
vi style of % jumping to matching brace."
  (interactive "p")
  (message "%s" last-command)
  (if (not (memq last-command '(
                                set-mark
                                cua-set-mark
                                goto-match-paren
                                down-list
                                up-list
                                end-of-defun
                                beginning-of-defun
                                backward-sexp
                                forward-sexp
                                backward-up-list
                                forward-paragraph
                                backward-paragraph
                                end-of-buffer
                                beginning-of-buffer
                                backward-word
                                forward-word
                                mwheel-scroll
                                backward-word
                                forward-word
                                mouse-start-secondary
                                mouse-yank-secondary
                                mouse-secondary-save-then-kill
                                move-end-of-line
                                move-beginning-of-line
                                backward-char
                                forward-char
                                scroll-up
                                scroll-down
                                scroll-left
                                scroll-right
                                mouse-set-point
                                next-buffer
                                previous-buffer
                                )
                 ))
      (self-insert-command (or arg 1))
    (cond ((looking-at "\\s\(") (forward-list 1) (backward-char 1))
          ((looking-at "\\s\)") (forward-char 1) (backward-list 1))
          (t (self-insert-command (or arg 1))))))
</pre> 

When your last command is a movement command, and your cursor is at a parenthesis, then it emulates vi's % command.  Otherwise it just types the % in the current buffer.

== Additional ways to match parentheses ==

See NavigatingParentheses for other ways to navigate between parentheses.

A popular approach is to use a single function button to bounce
between parentheses. Here is a self-exlanatory excerpt from my .emacs:

   (defun match-parenthesis (arg)
     "Match the current character according to the syntax table.

   Based on the freely available match-paren.el by Kayvan Sylvan.
   I merged code from goto-matching-paren-or-insert and match-it.

   You can define new \"parentheses\" (matching pairs).
   Example: angle brackets. Add the following to your .emacs file:

   	(modify-syntax-entry ?< \"(>\" )
   	(modify-syntax-entry ?> \")<\" )

   You can set hot keys to perform matching with one keystroke.
   Example: f6 and Control-C 6.

   	(global-set-key \"\\C-c6\" 'match-parenthesis)
   	(global-set-key [f6] 'match-parenthesis)

     (let
         ((syntax (char-syntax (following-char))))

Discussion in [http://www.livejournal.com/community/emacs/2494.html]

I use a modified version. If triggered between parentheses it will
bounce back to the opening parenthesis instead of triggering an error
and it will jump to one char after the closing parenthesis and thus
match the highlighting of show-paren-mode. ( [1 [x y] cursor 3] ?
cursor[1 [x y] 3] ? [1 [x y] 3]cursor )

   (defun goto-match-paren (arg)
     "Go to the matching parenthesis if on parenthesis. Else go to the
   opening parenthesis one level up."
     (interactive "p")
     (cond ((looking-at "\\s\(") (forward-list 1))
           (t
            (backward-char 1)
            (cond ((looking-at "\\s\)")
                   (forward-char 1) (backward-list 1))
                  (t
                   (while (not (looking-at "\\s("))
                     (backward-char 1)
                     (cond ((looking-at "\\s\)")
                            (message "->> )")
                            (forward-char 1)
                            (backward-list 1)
                            (backward-char 1)))
                     ))))))


== Strict parenthesis matching ==

It should be noted that the syntax-table makes all delimiters "even".
That means that a beginning parenthesis ( may match a closing bracket ]
if the delimiters are not balanced as a whole. Try <code>C-M-f</code> on the following expression:

     (  [   )  ]

Here is a short piece of Lisp code in which such a situation occurs:

  (while
     (re-search-forward "\\(\\[[0-9]\\),\\([0-9]\\]\\)" nil t)
     (replace-match (concat (match-string 1) "." (match-string 2))))

This code replaces, e.g. <code>[4,5]</code> by <code>[4.5]</code>.
Now, in the regular expression between quotes <code>" "</code>, 
the first opening bracket [ matches 
the first closing parenthesis ), whereas the last opening parenthesis ( 
matches the last closing bracket ]. This is a bit surprising at first sight.

Some people consider such behaviour as uncorrect, and have devised
new matching commands to ensure that a starting ( is always matched by a closing ).
The following code comes from the /gnu-emacs-help/ archive 
[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2004-09/msg00350.html]
and provides a new definition for the <code>forward-sexp</code> command, 
which is bound by default to <code>C-M-f</code>.
Note that these commands do not rely on the syntax table, which
may be seen as a limitation.
