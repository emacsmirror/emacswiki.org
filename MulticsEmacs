Multics Emacs was the first to have Lisp as an extension language.  It was written in MacLisp.

Of possible interest of Emacsers:

===Lisp examples===

===ALM & PL1 examples===

Alm was an [https://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics/doc/info_segments/alm.info assembly language] format used by Multics.

[https://multicians.org/pl1.html Pl1] was the Multics systems language.

* [https://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics/ldd/include/emacs_data.incl.alm emacs_data.incl.alm], "Structure emacs data" (for 8-bit I/0), 12/27/1987.
* [https://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics/ldd/include/emacs_data.incl.pl1 emacs_data.incl.pl1], "Add extended_ascii flag and extend breaktable for 8bit I/O", 8/1/1988.

===Command examples===

* [https://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics/ldd/system_library_unbundled/object/make_emacs.ec make_emacs.ec], "Exec Com to dump the Emacs Lisp environments", 9/29/1984.

===Archives===

There are several files that are archived in a format peculiar to Multics.  In order to read the contents of the archived files, you'll need a way to [https://multicians.org/mxload.html read Multics backup tapes]. 

Just kidding, Jeff Johnson and Eric Swenson have created an [https://gitlab.com/dps8m/mxload updated version] which should work on any POSIX machine.

I can confirm that it works on MacOS Sequoia (15.6.1) as of October 2025.
