Don't confuse the program <code>msmtp</code> with the ability to use [[MultipleSMTPAccounts]] in Gnus.

== Basic Setup ==
Here's a quick and short description of setting Gnus and <tt>msmtp</tt> to work with Gmail. This should work with the following software on Windows and *nix platform. The examples here are shown for the Microsoft Windows versions of the software but should work with just the path changes on *nix platforms.

<pre>
No Gnus v0.6 or higher
GNU Emacs 21.3 or higher
msmtp version 1.4.9 or higher
</pre>

The details above can be got by 
<pre>
1.	M-x gnus-version in Emacs 
2.	M-x emacs-version in emacs 
3.	msmtp --version at the command prompt 
</pre>

Your typical <tt>msmtprc.txt</tt> file would look like this.  Note <tt>msmtp --version</tt> will also tell you where <tt>msmtp</tt> looks for the configuration file. 

<pre>
########################
account anderson
host smtp.gmail.com
tls on
auth on
user sivaram.notthere@gmail.com
password XXXXXXX
port 587

logfile c:\msmtplog.txt
########################
account neo
host smtp.gmail.com
tls on
auth on
user sivaram.anotherguy@gmail.com
password XXXXXXX
port 587
logfile c:\msmtplog.txt
########################
</pre>

Attention: As in version 1.4.31 of msmtp, there is no need to fiddle with `message-sendmail-extra-arguments'.  Inside your msmtprc file, add the `from' command to each account. msmtp will match the `from' value against the `From: ' field of the e-mail header (only the address).

I have found an alternate way to allow msmtp to determine from the
email message which SMTP account to use. The following settings in my
.gnus.el works for msmtp version 1.4.26:
<pre>
;; This is needed to allow msmtp to do its magic:
(setq message-sendmail-f-is-evil 't)

;;need to tell msmtp which account we're using
(setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from"))
</pre>
A close reading of the msmtp documentation and the definition of
message-send-mail-with-sendmail in message.el will reveal how this works.
--taltman

Now, we'd like to use Gnus to send email through <tt>msmtp</tt>. Add the following lines to the <tt>.gnus.el</tt> file. 

<pre>
;; with Emacs 23.1, you have to set this explicitly (in MS Windows)
;; otherwise it tries to send through OS associated mail client
(setq message-send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
;; we substitute sendmail with msmtp
(setq sendmail-program "c:/gnu/bin/msmtp.exe")
;;need to tell msmtp which account we're using
(setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("-a" "anderson"))
;; you might want to set the following too
(setq mail-host-address "gmail.com")
(setq user-full-name "Anderson Guy")
(setq user-mail-address "sivaram.notthere@gmail.com")
</pre>

Now compose a mail in Gnus to see whether the headers come up correctly and then send the mail message by hitting <tt>C-c C-c</tt>
After a brief wait, the mail should be sent to the address specified. If there are any errors, <tt>msmtp</tt> error codes are displayed in the %%*echo%%* area as well as the <tt>msmtplog.txt</tt> file.

Or you can see what's wrong here by looking up the error code in the
man page

http://freebsd-man.page2go2.com/man3/sysexits_3.html

In the example above, we have used only 1 of the email accounts.
Gnus allows you to post using different accounts, which can be
accomplished with [[PostingStyles]].

To use [[PostingStyles]] in Gnus with <tt>msmtp</tt>, here's an example of how it's done

<pre>
(setq gnus-parameters
  ;;Use notthere id for all gmane news group postings
  '((".*news\\.gmane\\.org.*"
     (posting-style
      (address "sivaram.notthere@gmail.com")
      (name "Sivaram N")
      (body "\n\n\n sivaram\n -- ")
      (eval (setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("-a" "anderson")))
      (user-mail-address "sivaram.notthere@gmail.com")))
      ;;use anotherguy id for all normal mails
    (".*mail\\.misc"
     (posting-style
      (address "sivaram.anotherguy@gmail.com")
      (name "Sivaram Another")
      (body "\n\n\n Sivaram A\n -- \n")
      (eval (setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("-a" "neo")))
      (user-mail-address "sivaram.anotherguy@gmail.com")))))
</pre>

The variable <tt>message-sendmail-extra-arguments</tt> decides which <tt>msmtp</tt> account is called depending in which folder one is currently in Gnus.


Thanks to ssSslang on <b>gnu.emacs.gnus</b> who requested for <tt>message-sendmail-extra-arguments</tt> to handle multiple accounts of <tt> msmtp </tt>

-- Updated: 4/18/2008 (blbrown): To the original post, I couldn't get msmtp and gnus to work properly.  It kept returning an exit value 78 error.  I went to the msmtp documentation and made sure I could send a message directly from the command line with msmtp.  I would make sure that works first.  Also, here is my ~/__DOT__msmtprc file.
<pre>
##################

msmtp complains about the 'default' account settings, so if you receive a generic error while running with emacs; go to the command-line and if see if you receive more verbose error messages.  Also, recheck your rc file.


<pre>
Above configuration tested with:
OS: Ubuntu Linux 7.10
Emacs: 22.1.1 x86
msmtp version 1.4.14
TLS/SSL library: OpenSSL
</pre>

<b>Note that tls_cert_check = off makes you susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks</b>. The correct thing to do is to download the appropriate SSL certificates and configure them as describe in the msmtp man page.

== Yet Another Gnus/MSMTP Setting for Easy Multi-SMTP Sending ==

Multi-SMTP email sending in Gnus tortured me for long time. I searched for a sound solution for long time and can not find one. And I think using Posting Styles is too tedious, boring and prone to shooting myself. ILast Saturday night, I spent several hours, and found a sound and safe solution, and its setting is quite simple.

<pre>
;; Choose account label to feed msmtp -a option based on From header in Message buffer;
;; This function must be added to message-send-mail-hook for on-the-fly change of From address
;; before sending message since message-send-mail-hook is processed right before sending message.
(defun cg-feed-msmtp ()
  (if (message-mail-p)
          (save-excursion
                (let* ((from
                               (save-restriction
                                         (message-narrow-to-headers)
                                         (message-fetch-field "from")))
                           (account
                                   (cond
                                            ;; I use email address as account label in ~/.msmtprc
                                        ((string-match "myemail1@server1.com" from)"myemail1@server1.com")
                                ;; Add more string-match lines for your email accounts
                                ((string-match "myemail2@server2.com" from)"myemail2@server2.com"))))
                  (setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments (list '"-a" account)))))) ; the original form of this script did not have the ' before "a" which causes a very difficult to track bug --frozencemetery

(setq message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header)
(add-hook 'message-send-mail-hook 'cg-feed-msmtp)
</pre>

Though I use email address as account label, it's not necessary. You can use any style you like. Just keep labels the same as in .msmtprc and code above.

Q: Is there any way to protect the password? I don't like the idea of leaving it in plain text in the file, and for some reason I do not get prompted in gnus if I leave it out (although it works fine from the command line).

[new]
A1: MSMTP can use gnome keyring to store your password. If you specify auth but no pass, it will interrogate gnome-keyring-daemon for a password. This mitigates the risk of plain text password storage but is difficult to configure in a non-desktop environment.

A2: MSMTP takes the argument **--passwordeval=<cmd>**. In order to retrieve the password for the specified account, it will then run **<cmd>**. Since **<cmd>** can be anything, in particular **gpg**, you need not store your password unencrypted, just add **"--passwordeval=gpg --quiet --batch -d name-of-file"** to **message-sendmail-extra-arguments**, where **name-of-file** should be a gpg-encrypted text file containing nothing but the password. Note that if you miss **--batch** or **--quiet**, you will get errors which are hard to trace; the two disable unnecessary output to stdout and stderr, both of which emacs would capture.

== Using msmtpQ to queue your mail ==

msmtp comes with a simple script which adds the ability to queue mail.
I use it in gnus with these settings:
<pre>
(setq message-send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
(setq sendmail-program "/usr/local/bin/msmtpQ"
      mail-specify-envelope-from t
;; needed for debians message.el cf. README.Debian.gz 
      message-sendmail-f-is-evil nil                
      mail-envelope-from 'header
      message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header)
</pre>
msmtpQ sends the mail if there is a
connection or queues it when there is none. It is part of the debian package:
(/usr/share/doc/msmtp/examples/msmtpq/), but afaics is also in included in upstream.
I put it into "/usr/local/bin/". Don't forget to set 3 vars in the script and
make it +x.
To send your mails, you flush your queue with "msmtpq -r" (Yes, small q).
