Back on [[2025-07-04]] I switched off DuckDuckGo integration. I've been wondering whether people miss a more "intelligent" search.
Personally, I usually just use "matching pages" because it's super fast and almost always what I want.

I've also been experimenting with writing a search engine for single sites like this one, or "for communities" (such as all the blogs on [https://planet.emacslife.com/ Planet Emacslife]).
It's called [https://src.alexschroeder.ch/xobaque.git/ Xobaque] and I've fed it with the whole text of this site and of my homepage.
I wanted to see whether it would be possible to index multiple sites and then still limit search results to just one site.

Here's an experimental setup (hosted on a different domain):

[https://search.transjovian.org/search?base=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ Search Emacs Wiki]

Note that currently there are no updates to the search index.
I'm still thinking of how that would work, specially in a situation where more Emacs people would like their pages included.
More about that [https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque on my blog].

In any case, if you're unhappy with the current search, and you're not happy with what the big search engines are offering, and if you test this Xobaque project, let me know how it went.
