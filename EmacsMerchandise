office is losing colors fast. -- AlexSchroeder

Shipping is terribly expensive.
The reference is ok for basic movements, deleting, kill and yank,
saving, loading.  A pity that they mention `C-x (´ and `C-x )´ to
start and end keyboard macros, but fail to mention `C-x e´ to execute
them. -- AlexSchroeder

I bought [http://www.gnus.org/stuff/pterodactyl/pmug4.jpg mugs celebrating pGnus]

fading in the washing machine, and a cool logo, and a cool poem, too:
''In a cloud bones of steel.'' -- AlexSchroeder
