Lisp:sqlplus.el

[[image:EmSqlPlus]]

Facilitates interaction with Oracle via SQL*Plus (GNU Emacs 22 only).
Moreover, this package complements Lisp:plsql.el (Kahlil Hodgson) 
upon convenient compilation of PL/SQL source files.

= SqlPlus =

This package was inspired by sqlplus-mode.el (Rob Riepel, Peter
D. Pezaris, Martin Schwenke), but offers more features:

* tables are parsed, formatted and rendered with colors, like in
many GUI programs; you can see raw SQL*Plus output also, if you wish

* table will be cutted if you try to fetch too many rows
(SELECT * FROM MY_MILLION_ROWS_TABLE); current SQL*Plus command
will be automatically interrupted under the hood in such cases

* you can use many SQL*Plus processes simultaneously,

* font locking with database object names highlighting,

* history (log) of executed commands - see 'sqlplus-history-dir'
variable,

* commands for fetching any database object definition
(package, table/index/sequence script)

* query result can be presented in HTML,

* input buffer for each connection can be saved into file on
disconnect and automatically restored during next connect (see
'sqlplus-session-cache-dir' variable); if you place some
SQL*Plus commands between '/* init */' and '/* end */'
comments in saved input buffer, they will be automatically
executed on every connect

* if you use plsql.el for editing PL/SQL files, you can compile
such sources and error messages will be parsed and displayed for 
easy source navigation

* in sqlplus-mode or plsql-mode you can easy go to the definition 
of database object name under point (table, view, synonym, index, 
trigger, package, function, procedure) in filesystem.

Simplified usage:

* C-RET   execute command under point

* C-S-RET execute command under point and show result table in HTML buffer

* M-RET   explain execution plan for command under point

* C-cC-s  show database object definition (retrieved from Oracle)

* C-cC-c  compile PL/SQL buffer (must be in plsql-mode) and show errors

* M-. or C-mouse-1 find the definition of database object name under point 
in filesystem (use arrow button on toolbar to go back).

Tested in Linux only for now, feedback from other sys users expected.  
Please use Emacs 22+.

= As Ide Skel plugin =

If you decide to use sqlplus.el together with IdeSkel package, your Emacs 
will look more like TOAD or Tora:

= Bugs =

There is a bad interaction with ##require-final-newline## when it is set to a value that means that the user is asked each time. When saving the output in HTML, for instance, there seems to be a hook loop that keeps asking if a final newline is to be appended. Setting the value of ##require-final-newline## to ##t## does not seem to trigger this bug.

From the description above and after a quick look at the source, this looks awesome! I just hacked together something much smaller, some code to send queries to Oracle via SQL*Plus and to get that into lists that I can then manipulate. Can your hack do that as well? If so I can ditch my stuff :) -- MaDa

Yes. First, you must provide a function that will handle result of sql command:
<pre>
    (defun my-handler (connect-string context data)
      (message (format "connect-string: %S\ncontext: %S\ndata: %S" connect-string context data)))
</pre>
CONTEXT parameter is an alist with info about command executed 
(SQL text in particular). 
The DATA parameter is a list (COLUMN-INFOS ROWS MSG) if
result is a table, or string in any other case.  COLUMN-INFOS is
a list of column descriptors (name of column etc.), ROWS is a
table of records (record is a list of strings), MSG is a message
under the table (something like "28 rows selected.").

Now, you can execute any sql command (eg. query):
<pre>
    (let ((connect-string "scott/tiger@xe") ; must be password here
	  (sql "select * from emp;"))       ; a ';' or '/' at end of command is important
      ;; create sqlplus process for connect-string (if doesn't exist yet)
      (sqlplus connect-string nil 'dont-create-output-buffer)
      ;; send command - it will be executed in idle time,
      ;; so your function 'my-handler' will be called asynchronously
      (sqlplus-user-command connect-string sql 'my-handler))
</pre>
When sqlplus process is not needed, you can kill it:
<pre>
    ;; kill sqlplus process if no buffer uses it
    (sqlplus-soft-shutdown connect-string))
</pre>

I saw this pop up on the Recent Changes and had to take a look.  I only had time for a little work with it but wow! See my screenshot here: http://picasaweb.google.com/hostetlerm/Geek/photo#5138784267792412514-- MikeHostetler

I'm using sqlplus with ide-skel on Windows Emacs version 22.0.92.1.  Works great. -- Ben

Hi! Really like sqlplus. Using it on windows XP with emacs 22.1. Best regards -- Pierre

Hi.  I've been using this for a few days and really like it.  However, I'm experiencing some bugs with plsql.el.  It throws a RegEx error when trying to format PL/SQL Functions, also it doesn't capitalize keywords.  Has anyone experienced this and/or found a fix?

Cheers!  -- LaurenceRochfort

I've started using it yesterday (Emacs 23.1.94.1 of 2010-03-23, Windows XP). Right now I wonder how to load and save my foo@bar.sqp buffers into files and return to it next time.

Our database uses UTF-8:

{{{
(add-hook 'sqlplus-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (set-process-coding-system (get-process (sqlplus-get-process-name sqlplus-connect-string))
				       'latin-1 'latin-1)))
}}}

sqlplus mode is really good. I no longer need sql developer to browse schemas - good old emacs can do it all !

-- HarishSharma

[new]
sqlplus is really good! But is there any way to assign a connection to a buffer? The only way I found till now, when I edit an existing file, is to set the mode to sqlplus (M-x sqlplus-mode) and then restart the connection (M-x sqlplus-restart-connection). Best regards -- George

[new]
Really quite impressive. I've tried it under Win32, you just need to customize sqlplus-command (set it to the full path of sqlplus.exe).

As a developer you have to deal with several different databases. It’s not easy to keep all of your environments in mind. Let’s use Org-mode to help yourself. Keep an environment’s description in "org-mode" table:
<pre>
* environments
** databases
|---------------+-----------+--------|
| service (sid) | user      | pwd    |
|---------------+-----------+--------|
| prod          | owner app | god    |
| dev           | dbo       | love   |
| uat           | dba       | secret |
|---------------+-----------+--------|
</pre>
Place the point to a connection line, call sqlplus-x-connect and you will get connected sqlplus-mode buffer. If different users have the same password you can write them in one cell.
Here is the sqlplus-x-connect
<pre>
(require 'sqlplus)
(require 'org-table)
(defvar sqlplus-x-columns '(sqlplus-x-service sqlplus-x-user sqlplus-x-pwd))
(defun sqlplus-x-connect ()
  "Build a connection string and make a connection. The point must be in an org-mode table.
Columns of the table must correspond to the `sqlplus-x-columns' variable."
  (interactive)
  (org-table-force-dataline)
  (let
      ((cur-row (nth (org-table-current-dline) (org-table-to-lisp)))
       (is-user-selected (= (org-table-current-column) (+ 1 (position 'sqlplus-x-user sqlplus-x-columns)))))
    (sqlplus
     (format
      "%s/%s@%s"
      (if is-user-selected
          (thing-at-point 'symbol)
        (nth (position 'sqlplus-x-user sqlplus-x-columns) cur-row))
      (nth (position 'sqlplus-x-pwd sqlplus-x-columns) cur-row)
      (nth (position 'sqlplus-x-service sqlplus-x-columns) cur-row))
     (concat (nth (position 'sqlplus-x-service sqlplus-x-columns) cur-row) ".sqp"))))

(global-set-key [f4] 'sqlplus-x-connect)
</pre>
Advice. Use EasyPG package to keep your connections table in secret.

sqlplus mode seems really nice. But after lot of efforts I can't get it to work with our setup. Problem is our DB installation uses kerberos authentications and we don't have user/pass@SID to connect to DB. All we got is a kerberos ticket and SID e.g we login using sqlplus /@mydb. somehow I can't get it to work with sqlplus mode. Please help! Part of the reason could be I can't read/debug LISP code. -- Arvind Deshpande

To use kerberos, just enter "/" as user and leave password blank.  hth... don

(defadvice switch-to-buffer...) breaks dired's switch-to-buffer now on ntemacs 24. Commenting out ad-activate underneath solved it
