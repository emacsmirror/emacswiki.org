== Hello ==
portrait:http://www.colin-baxter.com/graphics/bear.jpg I am a physicist based in the UK - my [[http://www.colin-baxter.com/|web-page]] gives details of my research. I am ocasionally found at the  [[IRC]] channel #emacs under the nickname of  [::m43cap].

== My Relationship with Emacs ==
I came to Emacs late in life, after using just about every rubbish editor and word-processor known to mankind. Then beginning with AUCTeX and using Emacs as a writing tool, I gradually moved over several years to adopting Emacs as my default application for command-line work, (AnsiTerm), file management (DiredMode), email, Internet browser (WThreeM), a universal organiser (OrgMode), etc., etc. The abandonment of most other applications has wonderfully removed desktop clutteri! :) I do not do very much programming these days, except the occasional perl (PerlDevelopEnvironment) and fortran (FortranMode).

== Contributions to EmacsWiki ==

#  [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_pastebin|Access your Pastebin API-key from a Text File]]

== Emacs Projects ==
# Even though it is byte-compiled, my init-file is far too long. I am working on moving to a modular form of Emacs initialisation.
# I am incorporating a cgi Perl script to link my Emacs database (EmacsDataBase) to a web-page.

== Another Emacs Wiki ==
It seems there is a [[http://www.wikemacs.org/|another emacs wiki]] brought about in large measure it is said by the comments posted [[http://www.batsov.com/articles/2012/03/20/die-emacswiki/|here]]. I feel the criticisms of the old wiki are unjustified, and the creation of a new wiki is suggestive of taking away one's toys to play elsewhere. As of now (June 2013) the new wiki seems pretty empty of useful content. I await developments - if any.
