The coolest thing about the Emacs Wiki is the ability for anyone to contribute.  However, before you edit a page, you should probably learn [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowToNavigate How To Navigate] the pages hosted here.

== Categories ==

The pages of Emacs Wiki are organized into '''categories'''. This [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SiteMap Site Map] page lists all of the categories -- they appear as links to the individual category pages.  All category names start with the word `Category` and are in CamelCase and case-sensitive.

 
Categories are **manually** added to a page by the page editor or author, and you can add more than one category to a page, if appropriate.   You do this by just inserting the name of the category at the end of the page. 


For example, let's say you're creating a new page for a game you created for Emacs.  At the bottom of the page, enter 4 hyphens (this will create a horizontal rule), press return, and then input the name of the Games category, like so:

<code>----</code>

<code>CategoryGames</code>

That will automatically link your new page to the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryGames CategoryGames] page.  

Optional: if you'd like to split the CamelCased words in the category name into separate words for aesthetic or readability purposes, you can do something like this: 

<code> [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryGames Category: Games]</code>

You can read more about the markup language used here in the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TextFormattingRules Text Formatting Rules].


//Special note on category names used on the Site Map page//: The category names are abbreviated in the links used on the [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SiteMap Site Map] page -- for example, [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryKeys Category Keys] is abbreviated as [[CategoryKeys|Keys]]. It is the full name that you must add to a wiki page to add it to a category.
 

Most categories contain information about Emacs or user-contributed Emacs libraries.  There is one category, however, that contains information about the site itself: '''CategoryEmacsWikiSite''', and it is used as detailed below.

== Header and footer navigation ==

Some of the links on the CategoryEmacsWikiSite page are repeated in the header and footer of ''each'' Wiki page:

* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SiteMap Site Map] -- The main EmacsWiki entry point, with links to category pages.
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowTo How To] -- ''How to use the Emacs Wiki'' -- especially, how to contribute.
* [[Search]]  --  ''Search'' the wiki in different ways.
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispArea Elisp Area] -- Upload and download Emacs Lisp source code for extending and customizing Emacs.
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RecentChanges Recent Changes] -- Recent changes to the wiki.
* [[News]] -- Chronological Web log (blog) about the wiki.
* [[Problems]] -- Problems people are having with the wiki.
* [[Suggestions]] -- Your suggestions for improvement of the wiki.

There's a link, '''Edit this page''', at the bottom of each page.  Feel free to add new material or rework existing material.  See [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HowToEdit How To Edit] for additional information.

== Linking and reverse links ==

On this site, making new pages and links between pages is easy.  Clicking on a word or phrase gives details about that word or phrase.  Links appear in a list, in a paragraph, or at the bottom or top of the page.

The reverse is also possible with links and pages.  The relation between words -- or phrases -- with their respective pages allows you to find the pages that link to the current page.  Click the title heading at the top of the page to find the pages that mention the current topic.  In the case of category pages, click the title heading and the Wiki will list all pages that are in that category.  The [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WikiOrganization Wiki Organization] page has more details.

* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NearMap Near Map] -- Wikis in the neighborhood (Meatball, Community)
* [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InterMap Inter Map] -- Wikis outside the neighborhood, but useful for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interwiki_linking InterLinks] (linking within or between wikis.)
