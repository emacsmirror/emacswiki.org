With ##delete-selection-mode## enabled, pressing Backspace while [[region|selecting text]] will delete the selected region.

According to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Replacing-highlighted-text.html manual page]]:

: If you enable Delete Selection mode, a minor mode, then inserting
text while the mark is active causes the selected text to be deleted
first.  This also deactivates the mark.  Many graphical applications
follow this convention, but Emacs does not.

Put the following in your [[init file]]: ##(delete-selection-mode 1)##

== See Also == 

* TransientMarkMode -- Transient Mark mode is enabled in Delete Selection mode.
* [[delsel.el]] -- A modification by DrewAdams which is more compatible with ##completion-mode##.

== Footnotes ==

As an EmacsLisp programmer, if you want to adapt commands in your own code (e.g. some mode of yours) to `delete-selection-mode', then see this description of the use of [[symbol]] property `delete-selection':
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-05/msg00515.html

In [[XEmacs]], delete-selection-mode may be called ##pending-delete-mode##
