Grail loads an .emacs configuration that has been broken up into several files. This allows a user's configuration
to DTRT [Do the Right Thing] when used in different modes such as batch, or GUI. The user also benefits from
an easier to maintain configuration

Grail is grew out of a tidyconfig like need to re-organize after a .emacs bankrupcy. It has grown
beyond organization alone into a comprehensive management of load-path, porting configurations between linux & Darwin,
and partial/incremental loading to configure for batch, interactive, gui, and daemon modes.

All these features are implemented by putting configuration bits into the files that Grail looks for,
the rest is handled by Grail itself.

Examples of the files grail looks for:

* elisp.el    : your library of non-interactive functions. (for elisp coders)
* commands.el : interactive commands you have created.
* gui.el      : configuration that applies to emacs with a GUI
* user.el     : general configuration of the builtin Emacs features and applications.

Grail can also load "group modules", defined by grail as a elisp file in a special "groups" directory
that loads, configures, and installs if necessary one or more packages into a cohesive set of
related features.

This capability gives the Emacs configuration a "self-repair" capability when moving a configuration
to a new machine. Much of the code for this has been completed, but has not yet been documented
pending implementing integration with ELPA.

For a closer look at grail the README.grail file is the best place to start, and if you are an
Elisp programmer, a brief look through grail.el, a relatively short file, will introduce you to Grail.

Enjoy Grail, and feel free to give feedback, with the contact information provided on [[codermattie]].

== Status: 0.1.3 Released: 2009-4-10 ==

This release compatible with 0.0.3 unless you use the groups feature. The grail-activate-with-recovery
form and installer definition has changed.

[[Changelog.grail]] ([Download:Changelog.grail download])

it works reliably for me on Gentoo,Debian, and darwin. Adventurous users and elisp hackers (patches) are
welcome. The 0.1.x branch is a stable branch, the changes are fixes and updates to reflect expected behavior
only.

== features: ==

* Support for emacs --daemon mode. the user's file gui.el is loaded after the first graphical frame
  is created so that the basic graphical definitions of Emacs are available when the configuration
  is loaded.
* Comprehensive management of load-path for both downloaded packages and user Elisp.
* Errors in grail or the user's configuration are trapped and reported so that Emacs
  always starts clean, though the configuration is degraded until the problems are resolved.
* The user's Emacs configuration is loaded properly in all the ways Emacs is started:
    emacs --daemon, 
    emacs --batch, 
    GUI,
    and TTY modes
* ELPA installer

== The Future ==

Version 0.2.0 is in development. It will finalize the groups feature, and add support
for installing via Subversion,cvs,and bzr.

The core code for it is already completed, and it should be released by the end of April 2009.

== Updates: ==

Samuel Bronson restored this diagram of the USER_ELISP structure. It is useful, and also helped
me spot that README.grail was not escaped from markup. I have fixed README.grail and tried to
improve the diagram a bit too.

Samuel Bronson reworked the page with some EmacsWiki chops and it looks much better ! Thank
you Mr. Bronson.

The question regarding custom-file is now answered. handling user-init-file and custom-file
is supported in 0.1.3

== A diagram of USER_ELISP ==

This is a simple diagram of what the USER_ELISP directory looks like
when all of the Grail recognized files and directories are in place.

When a directory has a (++) next to it Grail will add any
sub-directories beneath that directory, as well as the directory
itself to load-path.

The diagram also shows which modes load the special files.  As you can
see only elisp.el, and gui.el are truly special in that they are
loaded differently from the others.

The files like commands.el, and keys.el are opportunities to organize,
they are not required.

display.el and gui.el are delayed in --daemon mode. display.el is
loaded before the first frame (TTY/GUI) is created, and gui.el after
the first GUI frame is created.

This delay insures that the GUI is actually loaded before the user's
customizations are loaded.

== Q&A ==

Q: What should I set `custom-file' to, i.e., where should I store my customizations?

A: the new release grail-0.1.3 now handles customizations.

   It looks in the variable "grail-settings-file" which points to 
   USER_ELISP/customize-settings.el by default.

   It will change both "user-init-file" and "custom-file" to point at your
   "grail-settings-file" when grail starts.

   If you have used Grail and customize before 0.1.3 it has likely
   written customize settings to grail.el itself which is not fatal,
   but not good.

   To upgrade to grail-0.1.3 you need to edit grail.el, or whatever
   other files have these customize settings, and migrate them to
   customize-settings.el

   I will ponder a migration tool if I can come up with something safe ...
