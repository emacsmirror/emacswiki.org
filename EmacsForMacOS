[[es:EmacsParaMacOS]]

== macOS and Emacs versions ==
The official Emacs fully supports Mac OS X (along with GNU/Linux, Windows, DOS, and then some).  

Versions of macOS prior to 10.15 Catalina include a copy of GNU Emacs 22 without GUI support compiled in and thus Emacs is automatically available on all but the most recent versions of macOS via the terminal. 

On macOS 10.15 Catalina and higher, [[mg]] (previously known as microGNUemacs) is still included. However, there are other Emacs distributions geared towards macOS that include GUI support as well as other features that may make it a more appropriate choice for some, if not most people.

=== A Note on Nomenclature === 
**Cocoa** is the Objective-C API (originally developed by !NeXT) that is used for native OS X applications, which has been included in Emacs since version 23.2.  Aquamacs and Emacs.app (which was merged into the official Emacs as of Emacs-23) both run under Cocoa.  Note that Emacs.app, GNU Emacs/Cocoa, and GNU Emacs/nextstep refer to the same thing.

**Carbon** is the C language API (developed by Apple) that lets applications written under OS 9 (or earlier) run under OS X.  Carbon Emacs runs under Carbon.  As of Emacs 23, Carbon Emacs has been deprecated in favor of Emacs.app.

**X11 Emacs** is the "original" Emacs running under X11. An X11 server available for Mac OS X is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuartz XQuartz]]. (Mac OS has no X11 server included by default; this has been the case since Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.)


== Vanilla Emacs for macOS ==

* http://emacsformacosx.com/ -- "Pure Emacs! No Extras! No Nonsense!" The site makes available [http://emacsformacosx.com/builds Releases, Pretests & Nightlies] and is maintained by [[DavidCaldwell]]. 

These builds are based on the 30.1 version of GNU Emacs and do not contain any additional packages or patches. Popular Mac keyboard shortcuts are available such as //Command-O// for opening a file); these are mapped to the Super modifier (i.e., the Apple/Command key functions as Super). .

When using the vanilla EmacsforOsx binary, a useful site for setting, at least, Emacs server and Emacs client applications is [https://korewanetadesu.com/emacs-on-os-x.html Configuring Emacs on Mac OS X]. 

Emacs shell environments behave differently from Terminal environments and in order to have correct environments and paths set up correctly, please consider using StevePurcell's [https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell exec-path-from-shell]  library.


=== macOS Distributions with extras ===

Custom distributions contain startup routines and tweaks to make Emacs' UI behavior more "Mac-like". In addition to that, they typically include recent versions of popular packages.

* [https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus Emacs Plus for Homebrew] is installed via homebrew and allows you to download Emacs versions 29, 30, and development.  It includes an injected PATH value from the user shell (based on StevePurcell's exec-path-from-shell library) as well as: unconditional support for gnutls, librsvg, webp, libxml2, little-cms2 and dynamic modules, built with native compilation, and is based on Cocoa.


* [https://github.com/jimeh/emacs-builds jimeh's Emacs Builds] offers either build scripts or homebrew installation of stable and development versions of Emacs.  It incorporates many of Emacs Plus' macOS-specific patches, as well as options such as Xwidget-webkit support, native XML and JSON parsing, and dynamic module loading.


* [https://emacs-modified.gitlab.io/macos/ Emacs Modified for macOS] is a distribution based on the latest stable release of GNU Emacs with a few additions, most notably [CategoryESS ESS], AUCTeX, and the R programming language. Otherwise, this is a stock distribution of Emacs. Users of Emacs on other platforms will appreciate the similar look and feel of the application.


* [https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/ Mitsuharu Yamamoto's Mac port] is based on GNU Emacs 29.4 (as of 2025-03) and claims to incorporate most of the features of Carbon Emacs and the Carbon+AppKit port from Emacs 22.3. It has improved C-g support, an emulation of `select' that doesn't require periodic polling, full screen support, subpixel font rendering, and smooth (pixel) scrolling. See the [https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/ readme] for more details. Available via [https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport Homebrew] and MacPorts (as emacs-mac-app), as discussed below, or [https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport/releases prebuilt binaries].


* AquamacsEmacs (https://aquamacs.org/) is a convenient distribution based on GNU Emacs 25.3.  Aquamacs comes preconfigured with a large number of packages and differs from other Emacsen in that it feels more like a Mac OS X application. OS X standard keyboard shortcuts are supported, files open in separate windows or tabs, nice fonts are available, and it has a convenient drag&drop installer. Hundreds of file types are supported (C, Java, HTML, Python, Ruby, AppleScript, XML, R (Splus), LaTeX (AUCTeX) etc.). All these extra modes come included and readily configured -- no InitFile hacking. Spell checking is easy to install (e.g., CocoAspell) and Asian input methods are also supplied, and options to deal with the missing Meta key on Mac keyboards. Aquamacs is based on Cocoa, the modern user interface framework in OS X. It is a ready-to-use Universal App for PPC and Intel Macs that works well on all recent Mac OS X versions.    Aquamacs was created by [DavidReitter] and is currently maintained by Win Treese.


== Building Emacs From Source ==

=== Getting the Source ===

==== GIT ====

To download Emacs using git, use this command:

    git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git

==== Tarball ====

Available from the [http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/ GNU Savannah Emacs] page.  Click on "Download Area" under "Quick Overview".

=== Building Emacs for OS X, using the normal GUI ===

There are many options for building Emacs (such as whether to build for the X11 GUI or the Cocoa GUI), which are discussed in the INSTALL file. There is also a script (Emacs/mac/make-package) to create a Mac OS X package for use by the installer.

To build Emacs under macOS 15 Sequoia you'll first need to ensure you have several dependencies installed:

<pre>
brew install gnutls texinfo autoconf
</pre>

Native compilation also requires 
<pre>
brew install zlib libgccjit
</pre> 


==== Building the source ====
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure [-FLAGS]
  gmake -j$(proc) ;$(proc) is the number of processes you want to use; -j8 is a common flag.
  gmake install
</pre>

NOTE: <tt>./configure --help</tt> will display all available compilation flags.

When the build is complete, you should see Emacs.app in the nextstep/ directory  Simply copy it to your applications folder and open it to run.

Alternately, you can run 
<pre>
open -R nextstep/Emacs.app
</pre>
from the command line to move the Emacs.app to Applications.

For more detailed instructions, see the <tt>nextstep/INSTALL</tt> file.  Additionally, you may benefit from reading the build script here: http://github.com/ieure/emacs-nightly.


==== Aquamacs ====

AquamacsEmacs can be built via build script or manually if you don't want to use the pre-compiled binary. The source is available from the [https://github.com/aquamacs-emacs/aquamacs-emacs git repository].  Then, use at the command line:

<pre>
./build-aquamacs
</pre>

Detailed build instructions are available in the <tt>aquamacs/build/BUILD-AQUAMACS.txt</tt> file or in BuildingAquamacs.

==== X11 Emacs ====

Directions to build and install may be found in the INSTALL or INSTALL.REPO files. The basic build and installation of the X11 Emacs application uses the commands:

<pre>
    ./configure --with-x
    make
    sudo make install
</pre>

==== Carbon Emacs (for Emacs<23) ====

Directions to build and install may be found in the file newly downloaded to emacs/mac/INSTALL. The basic build and installation of the Carbon Emacs application uses the commands:

<pre>
    ./configure --enable-carbon-app
    make
    sudo make install
</pre>

Note: Carbon Emacs has been replaced with Cocoa Emacs in Emacs 23.x. This is why the option --enable-carbon-app is no longer recognised by configure.


== Installing Emacs with a Package Manager ==

Package managers provide a convenient way to install and maintain/upgrade software.

=== Homebrew ===

[http://brew.sh/ Homebrew] has Emacs 30.1 as of June 2025 and is installed via 

<pre>
brew install emacs
</pre>

Note: The above formula [https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/81202/brew-install-emacs-vs-brew-cask-install-emacs does NOT] include the GUI.  For the GUI package, use the --cask formula below.

==== Cask homebrew installation ====

This can be installed via 

<pre>
brew install --cask emacs
</pre>

This installs a pre-built package from [https://emacsformacosx.com/ Emacs for MacOSX].


==== Other homebrew notes ====

* The current Homebrew path for Emacs is 
<pre> 
/opt/homebrew/bin/emacs 
</pre>

* A Cocoa-specific Emacs.app can be built using the <tt>--with-cocoa</tt> switch.
* A version supporting X11 can be built using the <tt>--with-x</tt> switch. Note that this version will not have all of the features of the Cocoa version; use only if necessary.

Other options include:
* <tt>--keep-ctags</tt>
	Don't remove the ctags executable that emacs provides. **Use of this flag is not recommended** Instead, use <tt>brew install ctags</tt> after installation. 
* <tt>--srgb</tt>
	This option will enable sRGB colors when using Cocoa.

To install using the <tt>--with-cocoa</tt> switch, one simply uses:
<pre>
brew install --with-cocoa emacs
</pre>

to get some "pretty" colours add the <tt>--srgb</tt> switch:
<pre>
brew install --with-cocoa --srgb emacs
</pre>

and finally link it to your Applications folder:
<pre>
ln -Fs $(find /usr/local -name "Emacs.app") /Applications/Emacs.app
</pre>

This creates a symlink and not an alias. So Spotlight may not find it (tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.2). Spotlight indexes symlinks to files that are treated as system files, but it doesn't show them in the GUI. It does show aliases though, so you could just command-option-drag <code>/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/*/Emacs.app</code> to <code>/Applications/</code> from Finder. Or:

=== Call AppleScript from Emacs ===

<pre>
$ osascript -e "tell application \"Finder\" to make alias file to (POSIX file \"/usr/local/Cellar/emacs-plus/25.3/Emacs.app\") at POSIX file \"$HOME/Applications\""
</pre>

After installation, using the <tt>emacs</tt> command in the terminal defaults to opening Emacs.app in a new window, separate from the terminal. This represents a change in behaviour from the version of <tt>emacs</tt> pre-installed on macOS 10.14 and earlier. If you want to run <tt>emacs</tt> in the terminal then it must be invoked with the <tt>-nw</tt> "non-windowed" flag. You are required to configure environment variables (EDITOR and/or VISUAL), shell profiles (.bash_profile) and other configuration files (.git_config) to invoke <tt>emacs -nw</tt> if this is your desired default.


=== MacPorts ===

!MacPorts [http://www.macports.org/ http://www.macports.org/] is another means of installing Emacs on Mac OS X or macOS
(and even other Unix-like systems for that matter which !MacPorts also supports).

MacPorts provides a number of builds, ports, and variations of Emacs versions and OSX/Darwin versions for download.

See [https://ports.macports.org/port/emacs/details/ Available Builds], and [https://ports.macports.org/search/?q=emacs&name=on Available Ports] for the current list.

The emacs-app executable installs to:
<code>/Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</code>

The various emacs packages <nowiki>MacPorts</nowiki> offers (e.g., org-mode) will install to:
<code>/opt/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/</code>

Note that Mac OS–X Lion comes with GNU Emacs 22.1.1, located at:
<code>/usr/bin/emacs</code>

Linux users, add these lines to your //.profile// (or //.bashrc//, etc.) to feel at home:

{{{
alias emacs='/Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs'

alias emacsclient='/Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient'
}}}

For the OS X native (Cocoa) versions, once you've got !MacPorts installed, run

{{{
sudo port install emacs-app
}}}

or (if you prefer a -- usually more recent-- development version)

{{{
sudo port install emacs-app-devel
}}}

It's also possible to build the development version of GNU Emacs with ATSUI -- Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging. 

==== Mitsuharu version in MacPorts ====

To instead use the Yamamoto Mitsuharu version of Emacs (27.1 as of 2020-11) (with more [https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/ mac-specific features]):

<pre>
sudo port install emacs-mac-app
</pre>

The application will appear in your Applications/MacPorts folder.

=== Notes on earlier Mac verions ===


[new:CarlGroner:2011-10-20 18:26 UTC] 
As of October 2011, the version of autoconf on OS X Lion is not recent enough to configure/compile Emacs from source. There is a workaround provided by using the autogen/copy_autogen script which will build emacs using pre-generated versions of the required build files. See the comments in <tt>autogen/copy_autogen</tt> for more information.


== Terminal Emulation ==

Read up on [[iTerm2]] if you want to spend most of your time in ssh using emacs rather than the GUI.

== Tips ==

=== Visit Mac files with native Mac app in dired ===

Use the shell mode. Make sure cursor is at the file, then type:
! open <RET>

=== Using the GUI Emacs.app from the command line. ===

To debug-init:

<pre>
open /Applications/Emacs.app --args --debug-init
</pre>

To --debug-init if you installed the Emacs.app from Macports:

<pre>
open -a /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app --args --debug init
</pre>

To open a file from a terminal. This can be used in combination with the sudo command.

<pre>
open -a /Applications/Emacs.app <file-name> 
</pre>

As above but for when Emacs.app has been installed via MacPorts.
<pre>
open -a /Applications/MacPorts/Emacs.app <file-name> 
</pre>

=== Call Emacs from other programs ===

Insert this into the .bash_profile file in your home directory:
<pre>
export EDITOR="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs"
</pre>
Unlike "open -a", this command will open a new window, and won't terminate until you close the window (C-x C-c). So, the calling program will wait until you've finished editing, before it reads the file. For example, change control programs like git and svn will call emacs to edit your description of a change.

=== Using Emacs.app from the Dock ===

Create an app that runs a shell script that runs Emacs.app, like this: use Finder to navigate to /Applications and double-click [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2488 Automator.app]. Select the document type "Application" and click "Choose". In the list on the left, select "Library". In the next list, find "Run Shell Script" and drag it into the workflow area on the right. In the new shell script, delete the text and replace it with:
<pre>
cd # Start in my home directory.
# Use my environment:
echo '/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs "$@"' | bash --login -s "$@"
</pre>
Select "Shell: /bin/bash" and "Pass input: as arguments". Click "File > Save..." and choose a name and location for your new app. For example, you might choose the /Applications directory and name the app "Emacs for Dock." Don't replace Emacs.app.

If you like, you can change your new app's icon to match Emacs.app, like this: select Emacs.app and right-click "Get Info" or press cmd+i. In the info window, select the small icon in the top left corner and copy it (cmd+c). Next, select your new application, get its info, select the small icon and paste (cmd+v).

Drag your new app into [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2474 the Dock] as usual, and you're good to go.

Your new app does two things that the Dock doesn't (on Mac OS 10.9).  The "cd" command causes emacs to start in your home directory, instead of the root directory "/".  The --login option gives emacs the same environment as an interactive [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X) Terminal]. [Beware if using zsh: the environment is that for a non-interactive login shell; that is [.]zshrc is *not*sourced; Mac OS 11.6]. In particular, it gives emacs your usual PATH environment variable, so you can run commands in emacs the same as commands in Terminal. An alternative to --login is -i, which sets the environment differently, as described in the [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files Bash reference manual].

If you followed above guide, and registered the app to the dock, and clicked it, it will actually create another icon in the dock for the running Emacs application.  After that, if you click the original app icon, it will not create another running app in the Dock, but the Automator might spin infinitely, as you already have it (as in the second app icon).

If you're using "M-x server-start", then you could use following script instead above one:
<pre>
EMACS=/Applications/Aquamacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Aquamacs
EMACSCLIENT=/Applications/Aquamacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient

cd # start in my home directory

if pgrep -U $(id -u) $(basename $EMACS) >/dev/null; then
  if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
    # set -- -e '(select-frame-set-input-focus (car (or (visible-frame-list) (frame-list)))'
    echo "\"$EMACSCLIENT\" -e '(select-frame-set-input-focus (car (or (visible-frame-list) (frame-list))))'" | bash --login -s "$@";
  else
    echo "\"$EMACSCLIENT\" -n \"\$@\"" | bash --login -s "$@";
  fi
else
  echo "\"$EMACS\" \"\$@\"" | bash --login -s "$@" &
  disown %-
fi
</pre>

Above script is tested in Aquamacs, but it may work with Emacs.  What it does, if you click the original App Icon twice, it will just give the focus to the Emacs(Aquamacs), and if you drag a file to it, it will call emacsclient to transfer it to the Emacs process.  If there is no Emacs process, it will create it. -- CinSK

If you want the Automator gear to stop spinning, try replacing the two lines between the last else and fi with 
<pre>
  nohup bash --login -c "$EMACS "$@"" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
</pre>

=== Use Alt/Option as Meta Key under terminal emulators ===

For Terminal.app, starting from Snow Leopard: Go to  Preferences > Settings > Keyboard > Use option as meta key.
Starting from El Capitan (or maybe earlier): Go to Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard > Use Option as Meta Key.

For iTerm: Go to Manage Profiles > Keyboard profiles > (your profile) > Option Key as...
For iTerm2: Go to Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Left/Right option key acts as: Meta

If you want to use Option key for both international characters and [MetaKeyProblems Meta key] in Emacs, see [http://swissarmyhammer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/osx-terminal-meta-key-national-characters/ this page] for iTerm 0.10.x patch and/or binary.

Alt-b and Alt-f for navigating by word also works for your shell now.

=== Use Left Command as Meta Key under iTerm2 terminal emulator ===

# In iTerm2 go to Preferences > Keys
# Under Remap Modifier Keys, change Left Command Key to behave like Right Option
# Then go to Preferences > Profiles > $YourProfile > Keys
# On the bottom right of the screen click "Right option key acts as: +Esc"

=== Call AppleScript from Emacs ===



=== Encoding for Terminal.app on OS X  ===

* UTF-8

The OS X Terminal.app uses UTF-8 by default.  To get the correct behaviour from the Emacs that comes with OS X,
I use the following settings in my InitFile file:

    (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)

you also can write accents like this C-x 8 ' character
see C-x 8 C-h

See UnicodeEncoding.

This also works with XEmacs 21.5.9 and above, at least.

* Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down in shell-mode

In shell-mode, the [C-up] and [C-down] key-bindings do not work as expected to browse the history ring. The problem
is that Terminal.app does not properly send these control sequences. To fix this behavior, open Terminal.app
Preferences>>Settings>>Keyboard. Select the "+" button and you will see that you can add bindings to the "cursor down" 
key with the "control" modifier. Select "send string to shell", and enter "ESCp", i.e., emacs M-p. Similarly,
define control cursor up to send "ESCn" to the shell.

=== Binding modifier keys ===

The variables available for binding the modifier keys: 
<pre>
mac-function-modifier
mac-control-modifier
mac-command-modifier
mac-option-modifier
mac-right-command-modifier
mac-right-control-modifier
mac-right-option-modifier
</pre>

values can be <code>'control, 'alt, 'meta, 'super, 'hyper, nil</code> (setting to nil allows the OS to assign values)

Also see http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2011-02/msg00019.html

example usage:
<pre>
;; key bindings
(when (eq system-type 'darwin) ;; mac specific settings
  (setq mac-option-modifier 'alt)
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
  (global-set-key [kp-delete] 'delete-char) ;; sets fn-delete to be right-delete
  )
</pre>

Example to bind the <code>mac-right-option-modifier</code> to <code>'none</code> so you can still use it to [http://osxdaily.com/2017/03/22/type-accents-mac-easy/ write accents]:

<pre>
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (setq mac-right-option-modifier 'none))
</pre>

=== Emacs keybindings in Cocoa Apps ===

This information does not regard the actual use of emacs, but I think many people will be happy to find out that some cursor movement / text editing keybindings can be used in Cocoa Apps. If you ever happen to use any other application on your Mac ... You can also set up additional keybindings as described in [https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/TextDefaultsBindings.html this document].

http://www.lorax.com/FreeStuff/TextExtras.html provides additional Emacs like features to every Cocoa application like alt-/ completion

=== Emacs keybindings in Terminal ===

[new]
So control-s is just beeping at me in emacs in the Mac OS X Terminal (10.4) on my home machine but works fine on 10.2 on my work machine -- what gives?  I've looked into the flow control tty issue and tried to disable it -- still emacs just sits there beeping.  M-x save-buffers and M-x isearch gets to be a pain.  Any hints for the Mac OS X Terminal?
[new]
: I don't know the answer to this, but the fact that it is beeping means that Emacs is probably getting it and just not understanding it. If it had anything to do with flow control, you wouldn't get even beeping. -- JonathanArnold
: this can be caused by checking the "speak selected text when the key is pressed" in the "Speech" control panel/sysprefs. The default key is ctrl-s. -- JeremyLeipzig

[new]
Say I want to run the function "forward-sexp" bound to C-M-f. I *should* be able to get at it with "hold ctrl, hold alt, hit f". However, if I actually do that I get the
result of the command forward-word (M-f). To actually get forward-sexp I must "hit esc, hold ctrl, hit f". However the alt key works fine as meta for things like M-x and basically anything that doesn't also require ctrl. Anyone know how to fix this? (This is using Terminal.app on 10.4.9 btw).

[new]
: iTerm sends C-M-keys and mouse events.  Remote emacsen run for months via iTerm + ssh + [[screen]].
Any volunteers to hack C-M- and mouse input into Terminal.app with GDB and Objective-C?

See the following [http://andrewmcdermott.blogspot.com/2009/11/cmd-key-happy-swap-cmdalt-keys-in.html
 blog post] for swapping the cmd and meta key. Also, if you want to retain one of the Option key functions as modifier for national characters, see [http://swissarmyhammer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/osx-terminal-meta-key-national-characters/ this] page for iTerm patch and/or binary.

[new]
: Terminals on most operating systems (including Terminal.app) have a very limited set of keys that they send to applications. Rarely will they send C-M-keys to the app.  For this and several other reasons I recommend running Emacs as a full app, not inside a terminal, except for quick changes.  You can use Esc C-f in a pinch but it's not as efficient as M-C-f.

[new]
: C-M-f binding is processed properly in Leopard's Terminal.app. I filed a bug-report with Apple when running Tiger and actually received an email reply telling me this would be fixed in Leopard (which it was).

=== Emacs full disk access on Catalina / Big Sur ===

Recent macOS versions require you to separately give Emacs (and Terminal!) access to your disk.

GNU Emacs for OSX runs a Ruby wrapper, so you actually have to grant full disk access both to Emacs and to <tt>/usr/bin/ruby</tt>.

=== Emacs Keybindings under X11 ===

See the following blog post for using alt as your meta key:

http://tylerkieft.com/archives/2006/10/05/redefine-the-x11-meta-key-in-mac-os-x/

=== Use macOS default shortscuts for Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All ===

If you want to use the default shortcuts for copy, paste, cut etc. macOS, put this is your .init.el.
Since M-x is overwritten in line 2, don't forget to reassign it. See the last line as an example.

<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "M-c") 'kill-ring-save) ; ⌘-c = Copy
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'kill-region) ; ⌘-x = Cut
(global-set-key (kbd "M-v") 'yank) ; ⌘-v = Paste
(global-set-key (kbd "M-a") 'mark-whole-buffer) ; ⌘-a = Select all
(global-set-key (kbd "M-z") 'undo) ; ⌘-z = Undo
(global-set-key (kbd "≈") 'execute-extended-command) ; Replace ≈ with whatever your option-x produces
</pre>

=== Maximize Emacs 23.3 and 24+ in Mac OS X Lion ===

Fullscreen mode is not offered in either 23.3 or 24+.  In trying to adapt the "maximize-frame" function below I inadvertently discovered that if one uses the maximize control button once the frame is maximized vertically, twice the frame is maximized both vertically and horizontally and three times results in the frame restored to its original size.  Good enough for me!

-pmr

You can also use Right Zoom ( http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/30591/right-zoom ) with 

-dwd

=== Enable / Disable Anti-Aliasing ===
To turn on/off anti-aliasing, use the following commands. By default, anti-aliasing is on.

 (setq mac-allow-anti-aliasing t)    ;; turn on anti-aliasing (default)
 (setq mac-allow-anti-aliasing nil)  ;; turn off anti-aliasing

For Emacs >= 24.4 and OS X >= 10.5, the default font backend has changed,
and no longer supports these commands. The old backend can be used instead
by running the following command in Terminal.app.

 $ defaults write org.gnu.Emacs FontBackend ns

The commands will then work normally.

Another option is to use the following defaults command, which has some effect,
but not as much as using the previous method.

 defaults write org.gnu.Emacs AppleAntiAliasingThreshold 100

To reverse the changes, use

 defaults delete org.gnu.Emacs AppleAntiAliasingThreshold

=== Make fullscreen work with posframe.el ===

<pre>
;; On Mac platform, Emacs can't enter Mac's native full-screen mode,
;; otherwise it will cause white screen and left and right sliding
;; after the original full-screen property is also integrated when
;; `make-frame' is created.
;;
;; So set `ns-use-native-fullscreen' and `ns-use-fullscreen-animation'
;; first to prevent Emacs from using Mac's native full-screen mode.
;; Instead of switching to the separate full-screen workspace of the
;; Mac, the traditional full-screen mode, traditional full-screen
;; mode, will only be in full screen in the current workspace.
;;
;; This way to execute `make-frame' when closing the code or plugin,
;; there will be no bugs caused by the sliding of the Mac's separate
;; workspace.
;;
;; On the Mac platform, you can't use `set-frame-parameter' and
;; `fullboth' directly to set the full screen.  That would also cause
;; the Mac window manager to directly throw the Emacs window into a
;; separate workspace, thus producing the same bug for `make-frame'.
;;
;; Therefore, when starting, set Emacs to maximize the window state by
;; `set-frame-parameter' and `maximized', and then set it to full
;; screen state after 5 seconds.
;;
;; Mac will not move the Emacs window to a separate workspace, and
;; finally solve the problem that the native full-screen window on the
;; Mac platform causes the `make-frame' to slide left and right.

                 ;; If emacs has in fullscreen status, maximized
                 ;; window first, drag from Mac's single space.

Don't fullscreen frame when emacs starts, otherwise the macOS window manager will move emacs window to another single space, above code can make emacs just fullscreen frame in current space.  ---AndyStewart


== Hacking on the Sources ==

The section is meant to collect useful hacks to the C sources (or to Lisp sources that are executed before any init files are read, such as ##startup.el##).

=== True fullscreen for the Cocoa build in Emacs 23 ===

This fork has patches for true fullscreen and it works wonderfully.

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/typester/emacs.git
$ cd emacs
$ ./configure --with-ns
$ make bootstrap
$ make install
$ mv nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications
</pre>

<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "M-RET") 'ns-toggle-fullscreen)
</pre>

=== Changing the Scrollbar Appearance ===

The size of the "knob" in a given window's scrollbar is proportional to how much of the buffer is displayed in the window.  When the whole buffer is displayed in the window, the knob takes up the entire scrollbar.  I find this distracting (not to mention aesthetically objectionable), and much prefer the behavior of applications like iTerm that show an empty scrollbar slot in such cases.  

You can get that effect in Emacs by making a small change to src/nsterm.m.   Look for this bit of code:

<pre>
- setPosition: (int)position portion: (int)portion whole: (int)whole
{
  NSTRACE (setPosition);

  em_position = position;
  em_portion = portion;
  em_whole = whole;

  if (portion >= whole)
    [self setFloatValue: 0.0 knobProportion: 1.0];
  else
    {
      float pos, por;
      portion = max ((float)whole*min_portion/pixel_height, portion);
      pos = (float)position / (whole - portion);
      por = (float)portion/whole;
      [self setFloatValue: pos knobProportion: por];
    }
  return self;
}
</pre>

and replace it with:

<pre>
- setPosition: (int)position portion: (int)portion whole: (int)whole
{
  NSTRACE (setPosition);

  em_position = position;
  em_portion = portion;
  em_whole = whole;

  if (portion >= whole)
    [self setEnabled:NO];
  else
    {
      if (![self isEnabled])
        {
          [self setEnabled:YES];
        }
      float pos, por;
      portion = max ((float)whole*min_portion/pixel_height, portion);
      pos = (float)position / (whole - portion);
      por = (float)portion/whole;
      [self setFloatValue: pos knobProportion: por];
    }
  return self;
}
</pre>

A further change is to have the knob be of constant, minimal size, so that it only indicates position in the buffer, instead of changing size according to the portion of the buffer displayed in the window (I find the variable sizes distracting).  To do this, use the replacement code:

<pre>
- setPosition: (int)position portion: (int)portion whole: (int)whole
{
  NSTRACE (setPosition);

  em_position = position;
  em_portion = portion;
  em_whole = whole;

  if (portion >= whole)
    [self setEnabled:NO];
  else
    {
      if (![self isEnabled])
        {
          [self setEnabled:YES];
        }
      float pos;
      portion = max ((float)whole*min_portion/pixel_height, portion);
      pos = (float)position / (whole - portion);
      [self setFloatValue: pos knobProportion: 0];
    }
  return self;
}
</pre>
