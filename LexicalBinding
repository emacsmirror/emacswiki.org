For a discussion, see DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding.

Emacs 24 has optional lexical binding, which can be enabled on a per-buffer basis.\\
To use it, set the buffer-local variable `lexical-binding' to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

For closures on previous versions of Emacs, see FakeClosures.

{{{
(setq lexical-binding t)
(setq test (let ((foo "bar"))
	     (lambda () 
	       foo)))
=> (closure ((foo . "bar") t) nil foo)
(funcall test)
=> "bar"                                ; without lexical binding, it would have failed due to an unbound variable
(let ((foo "something-else"))
  (funcall test))
=> "bar"                                ; without lexical binding, it would have returned "something-else"
}}}

==Problem with defun in lexically bound contexts. (For Emacs 24 prior to 24.3)==

Prior to Emacs 24.3, the <code>defun</code> special form didn't work properly in lexically bound
contexts (i.e. when the buffer-local variable <code>lexical-binding</code> in not <code>nil</code>).  For example: 

<pre>
(let ((counter 0))
  (defun counting ()
    (setq counter (1+ counter))))
</pre>

would not work as expected because the symbol <code>counter</code> in the
function's body would be dynamically bound instead of binding to the variable defined in the <code>let</code>.

The byte compiler did give a warning if you used <code>defun</code> in this way.

This issue was resolved in Emacs 24.3, where the <code>defun</code> special form was replaced by a macro that doesn't have this issue.\\
In versions prior to 24.3, the following macro can be used as a work-around:

<pre>
(defmacro defun** (name arglist &rest body)
  "Define NAME as a function in a lexically bound context.

Like normal `defun', except that it works correctly in lexically
bound contexts in versions of Emacs 24 prior to 24.3.

\(fn NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)"
  (when (fboundp `,name)
    (message "Redefining function/macro: %s" `,name))
  `(eval-and-compile
     (fset (quote ,name) (lambda (,@arglist) ,@body))))
</pre>

If you define <code>counting</code> as follows:

<pre>
(let ((counter 0))
  (defun** counting ()
    (setq counter (1+ counter))))
</pre>

it will work as expected and update the lexically bound variable
<code>counter</code> every time it is invoked, while returning the new value.

**NOTE:** The macro *always* makes a globally visible function
  even if you try to use it in a lexical closure.
  For instance, if you do the following:

<pre>
(let ((something 10))
  (defun** something ()
    .........
    .........))
</pre>

you get a lexical closure with a variable binding for the symbol <code>something</code>, but the function being defined will still be stored in the function cell of the symbol <code>something</code>, which is global. In short, remember that elisp is a lisp-2, and <code>let</code> binds variables only.\\

If you want lexically bound functions, you can use <code>cl-flet</code> or <code>cl-lables</code> from the **cl** package.\\
Alternatively, you can assign lambdas to variables and then use them with <code>funcall</code>, for example:
<pre>
(let ((foo (lambda ()
	     "I am foo.")))
  (defun bar ()
    (funcall foo)))
(bar)
=> "I am foo."
</pre>
However, like with <code>cl-flet</code>, this doesn't allow the functions to recurse.\\  
If you know of a simple way (other than <code>cl-flet</code>) to have lexically-bound functions that can recurse, please edit this page.


Note: I have named the macro <code>defun**</code> so that it doesn't clash with
the macro <code>defun*</code> in the **cl** package, however it doesn't depend on
that package. --- [[Bernard Hurley]]

== Using lexical binding in elisp libraries ==

To enable lexical binding in your elisp library, put a line like this at the top of the file:

{{{
;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
}}}

This will enable lexical-binding for the code in the file, but <b>note that global variables declared with <code>defvar</code>, <code>defcustom</code> or <code>defconst</code> will be dynamically bound</b> due to the global binding being marked as "special" by those forms.\\
Note: as of Emacs 24.4, any closures created **before** marking the variable as "special" are unaffected by this effect. It's not clear whether this is intentional. (I could reproduce this in SBCL, but not CLISP. Maybe it's supposed to have undefined behavior.)

Note: as of Emacs 24.4, the undocumented <code>internal-make-var-non-special</code> function does *not* work as expected, and the only known way to revert a special variable status is restarting Emacs. <code>makunbound</code> doesn't help, either.

=== Real world issues ===
One problem with using lexical binding is debugging. `eval' in especially in edebbug is unusable because the `print'ed version of the closures would take half a screen. Is there any way to tell emacs to reduce the printout a closure (e.g. #<closure>)? --LinhDang
