For a discussion, see DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding.

Emacs 24 has lexical binding, if you want it.
To use it, set `lexical-binding' and evaluate code in the same buffer.

You can have closures in Emacs -- no need for FakeClosures!

{{{
(setq lexical-binding t)
(setq test (let ((foo "bar"))
	     (lambda () 
	       (message foo))))
=> (closure ((foo . "bar") t) nil (message foo))
(funcall test)
=> "bar"
(let ((foo "something-else"))
  (funcall test))
=> "bar"                                ; would have printed "something-else" with dynamic binding
}}}

==Using defun in lexically bound contexts.==

the <code>defun</code> special form doesn't work properly in lexically bound
contexts (i.e. when <code>lexical-bindint</code> has value <code>t</code>) as of
Emacs 24.2.1.  For example: 

<pre>
(let ((counter 0))
  (defun counting ()
    (setq counter (1+ counter))))
</pre>

will not work as expected because the symbol <code>counter</code> in the
<code>defun</code> will be bound to the global variable of that name, if there is
one and not the lexical variable define in the <code>let</code>.  When the
function <code>counting</code> is called, if the variable doesn't, exist then it
will obviously fail.  Hoever if there is such a global variable it be updated,
which is probably not what was intended and could be a hard to trace bug since
the function might appear to be working properly.

The byte compiler does give a warning if you use <code>defun</code> in this way
and presumably the issue will be addressed in some future version of Emacs, but
until then the following macro can be used:

<pre>
(defmacro defun** (name arglist &rest body)
  "Define NAME as a function in a lexically bound context.

Like normal `defun', except that it works correctly in lexically
bound contexts.

\(fn NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)"
  (when (fboundp `,name)
    (message "Redefining function/macro: %s" `,name))
  `(eval-and-compile
     (fset (quote ,name) (lambda (,@arglist) ,@body))))
</pre>

If you define <code>counter</code> as follows:

<pre>
(let ((counter 0))
  (defun** counting ()
    (setq counter (1+ counter))))
</pre>

it will work as expected and update the lexically bound variable
<code>count</code> every time it is invoked, while returning the new value.

**NOTE:** The macro *always* makes a globally visible function
  even if you try binding the function to a lexical variable.
  For instance, if you do the following:

<pre>
(let ((something 10))
  (defun** something ()
    .........
    .........))
</pre>

you get two symbols with the same name: <code>something</code>.  One is lexically bound to number 10 and one is bound to a non-lexically bound function.  If you want lexically bound functions you can use the <code>lables</code> macro from the **cl** package.

Note: I have named the macro <code>defun**</code> so that it doesn't clash with
the macro <code>defun*</code> in the **cl** package, however it doesn't depend on
that package. --- [[Bernard Hurley]]

As of 2013-01-15, `defun` in the Emacs trunk appears to work correctly in lexically bound contexts
so this hack is no longer needed. --- [[Bernard Hurley]]

== Using lexical binding in elisp libraries ==

To enable lexical binding in your elisp library put a line like this at the top of the file:

{{{
;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
}}}

This will enable lexical-binding for the code in the file, but global variables declared with `defvar' will still be
dynamically bound.

=== Real world issues ===
One problem with using lexical binding is debugging. `eval' in especially in edebbug is unusable because the `print'ed version of the closures would take half a screen. Is there any way to tell emacs to reduce the printout a closure (e.g. #<closure>)? --LinhDang
