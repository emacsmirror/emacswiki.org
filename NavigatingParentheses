== Navigating over parenthetical groups ==

A /parenthetical group/ is an expression starting with an open delimiter
and ending with a closing delimiter, What is exactly an open and
ending delimiter is determined by the syntax table. This syntax table
depends on the mode currently activated. In lisp-mode, for example,
parentheses () and brackets [] are delimiters, whereas braces {} are
just symbol constituents.

The EmacsSyntaxTable of the current mode can be displayed by typing 
<code>C-h s</code> or <code>F1 s</code>. See ParenthesisMatching for
details concerning the syntax table. You will find there how to add
or remove pair of delimiters from the syntax table.

Navigation from parenthesis to another is done with the help of the 
following shortcuts:

  C-M-n  Move forward over a parenthetical group 

  C-M-p  Move backward over a parenthetical group 

== Navigating over balanced expressions ==

A /balanced expression/ can be a parenthetical group, a number, a word or a 
symbol. The precise definition of a balanced expression may depend on the
current mode. Here is how to move from a balanced expression to another:

  C-M-f     Move forward over a balanced expression

  C-M-b     Move backward over a balanced expression

See ParenthesisMatching for additional details about balanced expressions.


== How to find next delimiter ==

You can match delimiters with the help of regular expressions. Recall that 
<code>C-M-s</code> is the shortcut for incremental search based on 
regular expression. The following is available in regular expressions.

  \s(    matches an open delimiter

  \s)    matches a closing delimiter
  
  \S(    matches anything but an open delimiter

  \S(    matches anything but a closing delimiter

So, <code>C-M-s RET \s( </code> will highlight all opening delimiters.
You can then hit <code>C-M-s</code> repeatedly to jump from one delimiter
to the next.

A reminder: double escape is needed when using these expressions
in Lisp code, e.g. <code>\\s(</code>


== Over ways to handle parentheses and delimiters ==

Several other means have been devised to jump from parentheses to parentheses. Some are described below. 
Other can be found in ParenthesisMatching.

I made it by myself. Now I got it. :-）

      (defun move-forward-paren (&optional arg)
       "Move forward parenthesis"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at ")") (forward-char 1))
        (while (not (looking-at ")")) (forward-char 1))
      ) 
      
      (defun move-backward-paren (&optional arg)
       "Move backward parenthesis"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at "(") (forward-char -1))
        (while (not (looking-at "(")) (backward-char 1))
      ) 
      
      (defun move-forward-sqrParen (&optional arg)
       "Move forward square brackets"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at "]") (forward-char 1))
        (while (not (looking-at "]")) (forward-char 1))
      ) 
      
      (defun move-backward-sqrParen (&optional arg)
       "Move backward square brackets"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at "[[]") (forward-char -1))
        (while (not (looking-at "[[]")) (backward-char 1))
      ) 
      
      (defun move-forward-curlyParen (&optional arg)
       "Move forward curly brackets"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at "}") (forward-char 1))
        (while (not (looking-at "}")) (forward-char 1))
      ) 
      
      (defun move-backward-curlyParen (&optional arg)
       "Move backward curly brackets"
        (interactive "P")
        (if (looking-at "{") (forward-char -1))
        (while (not (looking-at "{")) (backward-char 1))
      ) 

These are my key bindings for these functions


       (global-set-key (kbd "M-)")           (quote move-forward-paren))
       (global-set-key (kbd "M-(")           (quote move-backward-paren))
      
       (global-set-key (kbd "M-]")           (quote move-forward-sqrParen))
       (global-set-key (kbd "M-[")           (quote move-backward-sqrParen))
      
       (global-set-key (kbd "M-}")           (quote move-forward-curlyParen))
       (global-set-key (kbd "M-{")           (quote move-backward-curlyParen))
  

I modified my global key binding. Replaced Ctrl with Meta here because C-[ will make Emacs behave quite strangely. Although some default key bindings are overrided, but it's OK to me
