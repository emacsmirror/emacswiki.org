[http://nschum.de/src/emacs/test-case-mode/ test-case-mode] is a minor mode for running unit tests.  It is extensible and currently comes with back-ends for [[JUnit]], CxxTest, CppUnit, [[Python]] and [[Ruby]].

The back-ends probably need some more path options to work correctly. Please let me know, as I'm not an expert on all of them. -- [[nschum]]

There is a [https://codeberg.org/emacs-weirdware-abandoned/test-case-mode version with changes by ieure] that supports tramp mode (and has a phpunit backend).
