Edit with Emacs is an extension for editing text areas in [[Google Chrome]].

* Extension: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh
* Development: http://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome

== Tips and Tricks ==

* If you use proxy, you may need to add "--proxy-bypass-list=127.0.0.1:9292" parameter to chrome command line.

=== Customisation ===

The extension has a number of variables that allow various behaviours to be customised. Currently they are:

* edit-server-new-frame - If not nil, edit each buffer in a new frame (and raise it)
* edit-server-new-frame-alist - Frame parameters for new frames.  See `default-frame-alist' for examples. If nil, the new frame will use the existing `default-frame-alist' values.

There is currently two hooks

* edit-server-start-hook - called with current buffer ready to edit
* edit-server-done-hook - called when the user has finished editing and exited the edit buffer

=== Controlling invocation ===

If you're already running an instance of Emacs in <code>--daemon</code> mode then you can wrap the code in something like:
<pre>
 (if (and (daemonp) (locate-library "edit-server"))
     (progn
       (require 'edit-server)
       (edit-server-start)))
</pre>

The edit
To open pages for editing in a new buffer instead of a new frame on
your running Emacs instance do:
<pre>
(if (locate-library "edit-server")
    (progn
      (require 'edit-server)
      (setq edit-server-new-frame nil)
      (edit-server-start)))
</pre>
