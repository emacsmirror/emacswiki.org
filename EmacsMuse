[[es:EmacsMuse-es]]
== Executive summary ==

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writing documents and publishing them to
various output formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook, LaTeX, and more).

The Emacs Muse is similar to EmacsWikiMode, especially its markup.
A comparison of the two is available on this page.

== What is it? ==

Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs.  It
simplifies the process of writing documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

What makes Muse distinct from other text-publishing systems is a modular
environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles" are derived
from to create new styles.  Much of Muse's overall functionality is
optional.  For example, you can use the publisher without the
major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or if you don't
load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be available.

The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions.  The focus in this revision is on the authoring and
publishing aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default
behavior (available in the optional muse-wiki module).  CamelCase
words are no longer special by default.

One of the principal aims in the development of Muse is to make it very
easy to produce good-looking, standards-compliant documents.

== Documentation ==

The Muse manual is available on-line in several forms.

* PDF: http://mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.pdf

There is an IRC channel devoted to discussion of Muse (as well as
EmacsWikiMode and perhaps PlannerMode) at <code>#muse</code> on
<code>irc.freenode.net</code>.  The current maintainer (MichaelOlson)
occasionally hangs out there.

== Status ==

The initial stable version of Muse has been released.  Nested list support and context-aware escaping of specials have been added to it, as of the 3.03  release.  The 3.10 release also includes an EmacsWikiMode migration guide in the etc/ directory.

PlannerMode has been ported to Muse.  See PlannerMusePort for history.

On 2/1/2010, Michael Olson released the 3.20 version and claimed it would be his last release of Emacs Muse. There was no active maintainer since then.

== Why use Muse? ==

The big question is: Why shouldn't I just use EmacsWikiMode for
publishing my stuff?

* Muse can handle different output formats.
* Muse is easier to hack on than EmacsWikiMode; its code is laid out much more nicely.
* It is easy to derive your own special publishing style from an existing one.
* A much improved journaling mode exists in Muse that can output to RSS 1.0 (RDF) or RSS 2.0.

== Miscellanea ==

=== What's missing in Muse that exists in emacs-wiki? ===

* emacs-wiki-menu.el, and emacs-wiki-macros.el

=== Customizing Latex output ===

Jim Ottaway has written a latex style that allows you to specify latex options
using the muse directives. So you can do things like 

 #latex-class-option +draft

=== Don't use the ".muse" extension; automatically select muse-mode depending on file contents ===

I do not like using ".muse" as file extension; after all, muse files are text files.  But opening all ".txt" files in muse-mode is also undesirable.  The following lines in my .emacs automatically open muse-mode if:

* the file starts with "#title"

, or,

* the file extension is ".txt" and there is a section header on one of the first 4 lines (it starts with "* ")

<pre>
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist 
           '("#title " . muse-mode))

(add-hook 'text-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (eq major-mode 'muse-mode)
              (when (equal (file-name-extension buffer-file-truename) "txt")
                (save-excursion
                  (goto-line 5)
                  (if (re-search-backward "\* [A-Z][a-z]+.*" 1 t)
                      (muse-mode)))))))
</pre>

I had multiple problems with the code above:
1st: According to the manual, auto-mode-alist controls "the correspondence between file names and major modes", so the first expression doesn't work as intended. I modified the 2nd expression to do all the work.
2nd:  it prevented me of running text-mode on an unsaved buffer - 
(progn
	(interactive)
	(switch-to-buffer "my-new-buffer")
	(text-mode)) - 
would fail. This was preventing me of running remember mode.
Below are my modifications on  FelipeCsaszar's code.
<pre>
;; muse-mode on *.txt files, if a #title or sect. header is on top 4 lines
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (or (eq major-mode 'muse-mode)
			(not (stringp buffer-file-truename)))
              (when (equal (file-name-extension buffer-file-truename) "txt")
                (save-excursion
                  (goto-line 5)
                  (if (re-search-backward "\* [A-Z][a-z]+.*\\|#title " 1 t)
                      (muse-mode)))))))
</pre>

=== Customize the Markup Rules ===

*Do NOT modify existing upstream source files*
* muse-publish.el regexps for markup rules.
* muse-color.el markup font faces in Emacs

/I prefer markup rules like LDP WikiText, which is designed for authoring before converted to DocBook/

[new:MichaelOlson:2005-05-30 05:28 UTC]

It would be nice to have a Muse add-on that can handle MoinMoin-style
rules.  Here is a transcript from a discussion that I had with
JohnWiegley concerning this issue.

[new]

<pre>
<johnw> now, you could make muse-moin.el, however
<johnw> and have it change muse-publish-markup-regexps, rule 1600
<johnw> and then you'd have what you want, and all styles would honor it
<mwolson> that would be cool
<johnw> the muse core allows for complete customization
</pre>

[new:XavierMaillard:2008-10-25 05:27 UTC]
What about having a more sophisticated way to customize the markup ? I
mean, we could have different markup used inside a muse-project or
even for each file in a muse-project. I opened a bug in the
bugtracker. I am still waiting for answers and support to start
hacking something.

[new]

There's a [http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/EmacsForMoinMoin moinmoin-mode] on MoinMoinWiki. The add-on can make use of the code.

=== More Muse Tips ===

Can get enough of Muse?  Find yourself spending more and more time with it?  Well now you can make your life even more Muse-centric by evaluating code (M-C-x). Thus referencing files within Muse becomes easy:

<pre>
  (find-file "~/.emacs")
</pre>

...also works great with Tramp:

<pre>
  (find-file "/you@example.com:~/.emacs")
</pre>

Or use Muse to launch your favorite file-browser!  Add this function in your dot-emacs:

<pre>
    (defun browse-dir (dir-as-string)
        (start-process-shell-command 
         "browse" 
         "*scratch*" 
         ;(concat "/usr/bin/rox-filer --new " dir-as-string)
         (concat "/usr/bin/nautilus --no-desktop " dir-as-string)))
</pre>

...then evaluate within Muse:

<code>
  (browse-dir "~/project/foo/src")
</code>

== Bugs & Wishlist ==

See [http://gna.org/bugs/?group=muse-el the bug-tracking interface].
Wishlist items are those with a severity of 1.

== Questions and Answers ==

'''Q:''' Could you provide a step by step guide about how to generate
a project of pages?

'''A:''' Check out the "Creating and Managing Muse Projects" part of the Muse manual;
hopefully that will be of use to you.  The <code>examples</code> directory in the
Muse tarball might also be worth looking at.

'''Q:''' Could you show how to set up muse to render mathematical formulae?

'''A:''' Muse now comes with muse-latex2png.el.
Check out its header for directions.
