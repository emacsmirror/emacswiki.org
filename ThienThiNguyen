Some EmacsLisp is under dir:

I use Emacs due to the kindness of David Asher of DEC HLO2 (Hudson, MA, USA)
in thwarting my innocent/imminent investment in EDT with the simple and direct
advice: "Don't do that! Here, use Emacs!".  Thanks David.

At the time, it was Emacs 18 under VMS.  Prominent concerns, now solved, were
the backspace/delete mystery, flow control (C-s / C-q) over remote DECNET
and w/ "strange" (not DEC-designed or VMS-sanctioned :-) terminals, and the
proper care and feeding of KEPTEDITOR.COM.

Over the years, Emacs has taught me many things, mostly by allowing me to
confront my assumptions about my abilities at the programming craft in an
interactive and non-threatening way.  I like making my mistakes in Emacs,
because a M-x rename-buffer is enough to keep them around for months at a
time, for reflection.

Sometimes I feel inspired to write doggerel about Emacs and Emacs-related
topics, but that cannot be blamed on Emacs.  Poetry is mostly harmless, while
(bad) programs are anybody's guess.  Perhaps, some thoughts should avoid being
codified, lest the energy spent forging the cage kills the bird, silencing its
song.

Your Emacs packages gnugo, hideshow and qa can not be downloaded
from http://www.gnuvola.org/software anymore - do they have a new home?

(I mirror your packages on the [[Emacsmirror]].
