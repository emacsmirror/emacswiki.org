Some EmacsLisp is under dir:

I use Emacs due to the kindness of David Asher of DEC HLO2 (Hudson, MA, USA)
in thwarting my innocent/imminent investment in EDT with the simple and direct
advice: "Don't do that! Here, use Emacs!".  Thanks David.

At the time, it was Emacs 18 under VMS.  Prominent concerns, now solved, were
the backspace/delete mystery, flow control (C-s / C-q) over remote DECNET
and w/ "strange" (not DEC-designed or VMS-sanctioned :-) terminals, and the
proper care and feeding of KEPTEDITOR.COM.

Over the years, Emacs has taught me many things, mostly by allowing me to
confront my assumptions about my abilities at the programming craft in an
interactive and non-threatening way.  I like making my mistakes in Emacs,
because a M-x rename-buffer is enough to keep them around for months at a
time, for reflection.

Sometimes I feel inspired to write doggerel about Emacs and Emacs-related
topics, but that cannot be blamed on Emacs.  Poetry is mostly harmless, while
(bad) programs are anybody's guess.  Perhaps, some thoughts should avoid being
codified, lest the energy spent forging the cage kills the bird, silencing its
song.

Your Emacs packages gnugo, hideshow and qa can not be downloaded
from http://www.gnuvola.org/software anymore - do they have a new home?

(I mirror your packages on the [[Emacsmirror]].

We have learned with deep sadness that Thien-Thi Nguyen (ttn) died in October 2022.  Thien-Thi was a hacker, artist, writer, and long-time maintainer and contributor to many GNU programs as well as other free software packages.  He was the GNU maintainer of the rcs, guile-sdl, alive, and superopt packages, and he was working on GNU Go as well.

Thien-Thi especially loved GNU Emacs, GNU Taler, and GNU Go: he was the author and maintainer of the xpm, gnugo, ascii-art-to-unicode, and hideshow GNU Emacs packages and made substantial contributions to many others such as vc, as well as to GNU Taler and its documentation.

We greatly miss Thien-Thi in the free software community - his death is a great loss to the Free World.
