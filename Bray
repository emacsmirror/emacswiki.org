Bray ([https://melpa.org/#/bray MELPA] [https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-bray CodeBerg]), is a minimal modal editing mode for Emacs.  Bray allows you to define a modal editing workflow through your own configuration with minimal overhead.

Unlike most other systems, Bray doesn't make any assumptions about which modes (called states) are defined, so you may define any number of states each with their own key-maps. While states cannot inherit settings, key-maps can be shared between states.
