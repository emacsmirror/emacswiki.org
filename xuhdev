I use Emacs for a majority of my code and text editing and I enjoy it. I have a [[https://www.topbug.net Homepage and Personal Blog]], with an [[https://www.topbug.net/blog/category/programming-tools/emacs/ Emacs category]]. I also run the [[https://8hob.io 8 Hobbies Tech Blog]]. You can also find me on various social networks:
