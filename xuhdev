== About Me ==

Since 2014, I've been using Emacs for a majority of my code and text editing and I enjoy it. I created [[https://www.topbug.net/blog/2016/08/17/dired-quick-sort-sort-dired-buffers-quickly-in-emacs/ dired-quick-sort]], an Emacs extension for sorting [[DiredMode|Dired]] buffers quickly. I'm also one of the main maintainers of the [[https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-emacs EditorConfig Emacs extension]]. Additionally, I've been making minor contributions to Emacs itself and [[Spacemacs]] from time to time. My personal blog also includes an [[https://www.topbug.net/blog/category/programming-tools/emacs/ Emacs category]].
