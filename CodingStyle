This is a collection of general coding style guidelines (mostly for Elisp), not an official Emacs coding style guide.

== C ==

A good place is your friendly linux kernel source tree, at
Documentation/CodingStyle.  At the other end of the spectrum are the
GNU Coding Standards (used by Emacs), available at
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html.

It's worth mentioning that TabsAreEvil and that 6-8 spaces for a tab
are preferable as they force the coder to find better ways to do
things than infinite nesting.  6-8 spaces is of course very hard to
maintain with something like java where just a method name can take up
40 columns.

== Emacs Lisp ==

=== Indenting ===

Use the default indentation.  Closing parenthesis shall never stand on
their own.

=== Overall Structure ===

Split the code into many small functions.  Functions should not be
longer than 24 lines, and no line should be longer than 80 characters.
Eventhough not many people use displays limited to the traditional
sizes anymore, its a good limit to set yourself so that you force
yourself to split the code up into small functions.

These are easier to document, maintain, and test.

When your source files grow too big, consider splitting them up into
various modules, to make it easier for other people to work on them
using [[Git]].

=== Functional Style ===

As many functions as possible should be writen in a functional style,
ie. they should not work by side effect.  This means that the they can
use parameters and defvar variables as input, but they should not
modify them.  All they should do is return interesting values.  Thus,
these functions do not change the internal state of Emacs when called.
All variables continue to have the same values.  Therefore they can be
tested again and again easily.

Usually that means that you have some functions that do change the
state -- functions that deal with input and output, and that you have
tons of small helper functions that split the tasks up into smaller
and smaller pieces.

Often a function A needs to call function B with some variable being
set to a specific value X.  Use `let' to bind these temporarily:

    (defvar X nil
      "...")

    (defun A ()
       "..."
       (let ((X "foo"))
          (B)))

Consider writing tests, Emacs uses the convetion of a `foo-tests.el` file for each `foo.el` file.

    (ert-deftest uber-fun-test ()
      (should (equal '(foo bar) (ueber-fun 12))))

=== Documentation ===

You can use M-x checkdoc and friends to check part of the documentation style for an elisp module.


=== Setting Long Strings ===

The following example shows how *long strings* can be
defined over several physical lines, thereby preserving
the maximum column requirement dictated by good style
(typically 80 chars).

{{{
(let ((msg "A long one line message \
with continuation breaks and not much \
content."))
  (message msg))
}}}

The trailing '\' must be followed immediately by a newline.

=== Module Header ===
Each elisp module should have header with information about the module. 
See Emacs Info for more.

Lisp:header2.el is a tool that lets you create module headers automatically. 
It can also update last update time, dependencies etc.

M-x copyright-update and M-x copyright-fix-years are useful too.

=== Symbols (functions, variables, macros etc) ===

Document every function, variable, macro etc. using DocStrings -- or
at least every such entity that you expect users to inquire
about. DocStrings must be ''split'' into separate lines, each of which
should be ''shorter than 71 characters''. The ''first'' DocString line
should be able to stand on its own as a ''summary'' of the documented
entity. When a doc-string line starts with a left parenthesis, precede
it with a backslash: `<code>\(</code>' (this shouldn't be needed as 
of Emacs 27 (refer [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=30393 Bug#30393]]),
but it's nice to keep compatibility for older editors).

In the documentation of functions, mention every formal parameter, and write the names of the formal parameters (variables) in upper case.  The actual parameters are not in upper case, of course.

    (defun foo (input)
      "Calculate output based on INPUT.
    INPUT is a number specifying the number of intervals."
      (bar))

Refer to other functions and variables that might be of interest --
usually the variables that can be customized the result, or the hooks
where the functions can be used, etc.  When referring to such other
functions or variables, enclose their names like ##`this'##.  Emacs will
then automatically link to these other symbols when the doc string is
displayed.

    (defun foo ()
      "Calculate output based on `bar'.
    This function can be added to the list of actions `baz'."
      (bar))

== ChangeLog ==

Use `C-x 4 a' to maintain a ChangeLog.  Depending on the project, this
file may or may not be checked in.  When you commit, remove the file
name and the indentation, and use the same text for your commit
message.

In the <nowiki>ChangeLog</nowiki> file:

    2002-12-24  Alex Schroeder  <alex@emacswiki.org>

            * erc-track.el (erc-make-mode-line-buffer-name): Removed a
            superfluous if construct around erc-track-showcount-string.
            (erc-track-modified-channels): Use 1+.
            Plus some doc and comment changes.

When checking into [[Git]]:

    (erc-make-mode-line-buffer-name): Removed a 
    superfluous if construct around erc-track-showcount-string.
    (erc-track-modified-channels): Use 1+.
    Plus some doc and comment changes.

Remember what the purpose of the ChangeLog is:  It helps to find when
variables and functions were introduced, when they were changed, why
they where changed, and by whom.  For doc strings, this is much less
interesting.  Often changes to doc strings are not listed in the log
when other, more important changes were also made.  Generally, making
an entry for doc string changes is only necessary when you want to
record that somebody made a contribution without writing any code, or
when the usage of a variable changed in backwards-incompatible ways.
But those are special circumstances, anyway.

== Unified Configuration Across Editors ==

Unified configuration across editors can be useful for a team in which
everyone uses their own editing tool. This can be done by using
[http://editorconfig.com EditorConfig]. Its Emacs extension is available
[https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-emacs here].
