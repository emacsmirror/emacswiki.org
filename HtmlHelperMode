== Overview ==

`html-helper-mode' was created by Nelson Minar in 1994 and has been improved and maintained by Arni Magnusson since 2023 (version >= 4.0.0).

A relatively simple mode without special dependencies, it provides syntax highlighting, indentation, and a few handy functions documented in the mode help page.

The indentation seems to be more useful than what some of the alternative HTML modes offer.
