Library <tt>[[info+.el]]</tt> extends the standard Emacs library ##info.el## in several ways.  '''[::Info+]''' provides:

* Additional, finer-grained highlighting.  This makes a '''''big''''' difference in readability.
** Quoted names, like this: `name-stands-out', and strings, like this: "<code>string-stands-out</code>" are highlighted if '''`Info-fontify-quotations-flag'''' is non-`nil'.
** Angle-bracketed names, like this: `TAB', are highlighted if '''`Info-fontify-angle-bracketed-flag'''' and `Info-fontify-quotations-flag' are non-`nil'.
** Isolated single quotes, like this: ##'foobar##, are highlighted if '''`Info-fontify-single-quote-flag'''' and `Info-fontify-quotations-flag' are non-`nil'.
** In the Emacs Lisp manual, reference items are highlighted, so they stand out.  This means: constants, [[command]]s, functions, [[macro]]s, special forms, syntax classes, [[user option]]s, and other [[variable]]s.

:: You can toggle each of the `Info-fontify-*-flag' options from the `Info' menu or by command.

:: Here is a screenshot of the <code>*Info*</code> buffer, showing some of the highlighting:

:: [[image:DrewsEmacsInfoImage]]

* You can show breadcrumbs in the [[mode line]] or the [[header line]], or both.  See where you are in the Info hierarchy, and access higher nodes directly. 

** In the mode line. Turned ''on'' by default. See `##Toggle Breadcrumbs##' in `mouse-3' mode-line menu and `##Toggle Breadcrumbs in Mode Line##' in `Info' menu (e.g. in the minor-mode indicator). You can customize [[option]] '''`Info-breadcrumbs-in-mode-line-mode'''' if you want to turn it off by default. (Available for Emacs 23+ only.)

** In the header (just below the header line).  I added this to vanilla Emacs 23. Turned ''off'' by default in '''Info+'''.  See `##Toggle Breadcrumbs in Header Line##' in `Info' menu.  Be aware that unlike breadcrumbs in the mode line, this can occasionally throw off the destination accuracy of cross references and searches slightly. (Available for Emacs 22+ only.)  Here is a screenshot showing breadcrumbs in the header line (only):

* New key bindings, commands, and menus.
* Improved standard commands.  For example:
** `info-display-manual': Completion for manual name.
** `Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node': If the key's [[command]] is not found, then it searches for the [[key sequence]] in the text.

* Syntax table that respects EmacsLisp: apostrophe ('''##'##''') and non-breaking space have ''punctuation'' syntax, not ''word'' syntax.  So for example, you can easily use `C-s C-w' to select text between ##`##...##'## without also grabbing the ##'## at the end. (I reported this as Emacs bug [[http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3312|#3312]], which was fixed a couple years later in Emacs 24.)

* Redefinitions of some standard Emacs functions
** An Info [[frame]] is dynamically shrink-wrapped to fit each node individually (if `Info-fit-frame-flag' is non-`nil').
** Searching highlights the found regexp (if `search-highlight' is non-`nil').
** Better default values for input.
** More informative messages -- e.g. how many additional matches found.
* `*info*' has been removed from `same-window-buffer-names', so that a separate window can be used if you so choose.


* New commands
** '''`Info-virtual-book'''' (bound to '''`v'''') -- Open a virtual Info manual of saved nodes from any number of manuals.  The nodes are those saved in [[option]] '''`Info-virtual-book''''.  With `C-u', [[bookmark]]ed Info nodes are also included.  See also `<tt>[[Icicles - Info Enhancements#VirtualInfoBooks|icicle-Info-virtual-book]]</tt>'.
** '''`Info-save-current-node'''' (bound to '''`##.##'''') -- Save name of current node to list `Info-saved-nodes', for use by `v' (`Info-virtual-book').
** '''`Info-merge-subnodes'''' -- Integrate the current Info node with its subnodes (the nodes in its Menu), perhaps recursively. 

:: Use `Info-merge-subnodes' to extract a self-contained report (possibly the whole manual) from an Info manual. The report is itself an Info buffer, with hyperlinks and normal Info behavior.

:: There are various prefix-argument options that govern just how subnodes are treated (recursively or not, for instance). There are a few user variables that let you customize the report appearance.

:: Here is a screenshot of a report. I removed most of the text in each node (replacing it by a narrow band of white with "'''. . .'''") so that I could show more than one node in the screenshot; the real report is a buffer 322 lines long.

:: [[image:DrewsEmacsInfoMerged]]

:: You can convert such a report to HTML using menu Tools > HTMLize Buffer (`mkhtml-any-buffer') from library Lisp:mkhtml.el. For more information, see SaveAsHtml.  (That code is quite old, however.)

Your recognition of info-quoted-name seems like is not right, e.g.
<code>
 `(a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
</code>
info-quoted-name highlight it. -- [[ahei]]


[new:DrewAdams:2009-11-06 18:40 UTC]
Only if it is followed (somewhere) by a normal single-quote: ##'##. But yes, otherwise, you are correct.

Highlighting ##`...'## and ##"..."## strings is problematic. In general, the results are good, but there are several things that can throw it off. Fortunately, these things do not occur that commonly in manuals -- but they do occur. The more typical problem is an isolated ##"## character referred to as such in the manual (e.g. ##?"##). You'll just have to live with it or, if you think it's not worth it, customize `Info-fontify-quotations-flag' to nil. -- DrewAdams

OK, I see -- [[ahei]]

Hi!
A quick question: how to prevent info+ to split my window. I want the original info behavior, if i type M-x info, i want a full window to read.
Thanks!  --[[PasJa]]

[new:DrewAdams:2011-08-23 17:48 UTC]
Should be OK now.  I had some hard-coded cruft leftover from 1999.  Thx -- DrewAdams

Hi!
Version info in current update is inconsistent with previous one. We had Version 21.1 Update #: 4855 while currently Version is 0 with Update #: 4857
Could you correct this? Thanks!  --[[Marcin]]

[new:DrewAdams:2013-08-14 14:30 UTC]
Hi [[Marcin]].  It is correct as is.  I don't use version information for <tt>[[info+.el]]</tt> (or for most of my other libraries either).  ##package.el## needs header field `Package-Requires' to include a version number, however.  (Pseudo) version `0' allows any package requiring the given package to use any version of the required one.  

Each of my library files has a `Last-Updated' field that has the date and last `##Update ###' (which is incremented each time I save the file).  This is the best info to use for reporting/communicating (e.g. about bugs).  Users can ignore the `Version' field for most of my libraries.

Thx -- DrewAdams
