Often referred to collectively as 'Ivy', however all 3 of these (related) tools live in the same repository: https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper.  They are also available via GNU ELPA and MELPA.

Ivy strives for minimalism, simplicity, customizability and discoverability.  Many consider Ivy to follow Emacs paradigms more closely than similar packages (aka 'completion frameworks', in particular, [[Helm]]).

From the repo:

flexible, simple tools for minibuffer completion in Emacs

This repository contains:

* Ivy - a generic completion mechanism for Emacs.
* Counsel - a collection of Ivy-enhanced versions of common Emacs commands.
* Swiper, an Ivy-enhanced alternative to Isearch.
