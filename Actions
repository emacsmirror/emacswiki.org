This page describes package Lisp:actions.el, by ViniciusJoseLatorre.

: .:: ''v0.16'' ::.

== About actions ==

This package provides an action menu which items are visible depending on
the point context.

As an usage example, it can be used with DiredMode to expand ##.tar.gz##
files, or view/edit an image file by just clicking ##M-F6## on file, then an
menu with defined actions is shown.

Or grep a word by clicking ##M-F6## on the word.


== Using actions ==

To use Lisp:actions.el insert in your ##~/.emacs## file (or ##c:/_emacs##, if you're
using Windows 9x/NT or MS-DOS):

   (require 'actions)


== Options ==

Below it's shown a brief description of `actions' options, please, see the
options declaration in the code for a long documentation.

; `actions-menu' : Define a submenu the same way as `easy-menu-define' does it.

; `actions-options' : Alist for tool options (see tool manual).

To set the above options you may:

[new]
a) insert the code in your ~/.emacs, like:

   (setq actions-menu '("Action" ["Option" (action) :visible t]))

This way always keep your default settings when you enter a new Emacs session.

[new]
b) or use `set-variable' in your Emacs session, like:

   M-x set-variable RET actions-menu RET
   '("Action" ["Option" (action) :visible t]) RET

This way keep your settings only during the current Emacs session.

[new]
c) or use customization, for example:

# click on MenuBar ##Help## option,
# then click on ##Customize##,
# then click on ##Browse Customization Groups##,
# expand ##Tools## group,
# expand ##Actions## group
# and then customize Actions options.

Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
you leave out the current Emacs session.

[new]
d) or see the option value:

   C-h v actions-menu RET

and click the ##customize## hypertext button.
Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
you leave out the current Emacs session.
