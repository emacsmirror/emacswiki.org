==Overview==
Set Emacs faces based on available fonts.

==dynamic-fonts==
Dynamic-fonts.el makes font configuration more portable between
machines.  When Emacs is starting up, dynamic-fonts chooses fonts
for your basic faces based on which fonts are actually available.

You may set a list of fonts in order of preference using customize.

To use dynamic-fonts, place the dynamic-fonts.el file somewhere
Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

	(require 'dynamic-fonts)
	(dynamic-fonts-setup)

==See Also==
M-x customize-group RET dynamic-fonts RET

==Notes==
The secondary purpose of this library is to provide some font
utility functions to be called from Lisp.  See in particular
`dynamic-fonts-font-exists-p', which tests font availability.

==Availability==
dynamic-fonts.el is available at github:
