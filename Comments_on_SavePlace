Enabling save-place slowed down my emacs exiting by a huge amount - 9 seconds.  I tracked it down to save-place-forget-unreadable-files, which removes any file that can't be read from the list to save.  I have many files loaded over NFS.  When exiting, save-place-forget-unreadable-files checks if each file is readable, which for hundreds of files seems to be slow when they're on NFS.

(setq save-place-forget-unreadable-files nil) restores my emacs exit to nearly instantaneous.

I believe the advice about the problems with the daemon might be a bit outdated, given that if you have emacs as a systemd service (as will be the default way of running the daemon on most linux systems atm), it is correctly exited with 
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)".
