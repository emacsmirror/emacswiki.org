I maintain a comprehensive [https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d Emacs config for polyglot programmers], which seems to have been adopted by a large number of other people, and I've authored 50+ original Elisp packages, including LessCssMode, [https://github.com/purcell/package-lint package-lint], [https://github.com/purcell/elisp-slime-nav elisp-slime-nav], [https://github.com/purcell/whitespace-cleanup-mode whitespace-cleanup-mode] and many more. Additionally, I co-maintain a number of other packages, including ledger-mode, haskell-mode, and symbol-overlay.

In 2015 I recorded an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq0hG_om9xY Emacs Chat] with Sacha Chua, covering my work on MELPA and other Emacs-related things. (Sacha has [http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/emacs-chat-with-steve-purcell/ notes on the talk here].)
