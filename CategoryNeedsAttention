Maybe you found something on the wiki that needs some help.  Great!
Arguably, you should just go ahead and make the change.  Be brave!  Old
revisions are saved, and stored in source control, so you can't break
anything.  That said, maybe there are time pressures with daily life, or
maybe you feel like you don't have enough experience, or a host of other
reasons.  That's where this category comes in.

If you flag a with CategoryNeedsAttention, that means another helpful
visitor can get in there and fix the problem.  Try to localize the
portion of the wiki that needs attention, and put in a small explanation
as to what exactly needs attention.

There might also be some discussion of areas in need of work in
EmacsWikiContent

== How To ==

Say you find some elisp code that sucks, and doesn't work with a current
Emacs.  Here's what you do:

# click the _Administration_ link at the bottom
# find the item where it says that this page "needs attention" and
  provide a reason
# click the Submit button

If you provided "outdated lisp" as the reason, clicking the Submit
button adds the following to the bottom of the page:

{{{
CategoryNeedsAttention (outdated lisp)
}}}

People interested in fixing pages that need attention can click on the
header of this page and find all the pages that mention it.
