I've seen this but the fact that this needs Javascript on the client side disqualifies it for now. I'm really into the silly idea that the wikis can be edited with text browsers as diverse as lynx, w3m, cha, links2, shell scripts using curl and applications written in Emacs Lisp. I love that, even if I rarely use it. Maybe it even works with edbrowse! I haven't tried that, though.
