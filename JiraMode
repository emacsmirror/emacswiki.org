`jira-mode' is a major mode for connecting and using a Jira bug tracking server from emacs. Currently, only GNU emacs (22 and 23) is tested and supported; that's not to say other versions will or won't work.

The source can be found [[jira.el|here]].

*New in 0.3.3*

Issue keys, project keys, and filter ID's are now "links" that can be loaded by pressing return while the cursor is on the word. Mouse clicking is not available, yet.

== What is Jira? ==

Jira is a bug and issue tracking program. More information can be found on [[http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/|the Atlassian website]].

== What is `jira-mode'? ==

`jira-mode' is an emacs major mode for working with Jira. Using `jira-mode', you can:
* create tickets, 
* comment on tickets,
* assign tickets,
* list projects and issues,
* search projects and issues

== Requirements ==

In order to run jira-mode you will need:
* [[XmlRpc]]

== How do I start `jira-mode'? ==

# Download the source file: [[jira.el]]
# Place the source file in your emacs load path.
# Put the following line in your .emacs:
<code>(require 'jira)</code>
# Before running `jira-mode' the first time, use `M-x customize-variable' to set `jira-url' to the XML-RPC url of your jira server. This is typically at <tt><nowiki>http://<where jira is installed>/rpc/xmlrpc</nowiki></tt>.
# Type `M-x jira-mode <return>'.
# Enter your username and password.
# You are in `jira-mode' when you see <tt>"Welcome to jira-mode!"</tt>

== How do I use `jira-mode'? ==

When `jira-mode' loads, it creates a new buffer called *Jira*. Once you are in `jira-mode', you use simple key strokes to perform actions. For instance, to quit `jira-mode', press 'Q'. To view an issue, press 'i' then give the project key (i.e. MYPROJ-1). To make reading the comments for a ticket easier, you can press 'n' and 'p' which will place the next or previous (respectively) comment at the top of the buffer. There are many  other functions that can be used. For a full list of key-bindings an functions, type `C-h m' from within `jira-mode'.

When you search for issues, list issues or projects, and the like, issue keys, project names, etc. will be underlined links that, if return is pressed while the cursor is on an underlined key, will load the issue/project/etc.

== Known Issues and Problems ==

# Currently, some tasks seem to run a bit slow, especially logging in. I believe this has to do with the connection xmlrpc has to establish. It seems that once the connection is established things run much more quickly and smoothly. However, the connection will timeout, which can cause the next action to take longer again. 

# Atlassian does not support all functions over XMLRPC. For instance, ticket resolution and changing ticket status can not be performed over XMLRPC. This is a part of Jira by design and I can do nothing about it. I have looked into possibly using SOAP instead of XMLRPC, as SOAP seems to support more functions, but have not done more than a little reading and research.
  Have a look at http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/, I use it to access the JIRA SOAP interface and supports ticket resolution and ticket status and all the rest of the stuff :-)

# If the jira system not the newest, you may get "Exception: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: com.atlassian.jira.rpc.xmlrpc.JiraXmlRpcService.getProjectsNoScheme(java.lang.String)" exception, you can just replace the getProjectsNoScheme with getProjects method in jira.el, which is a old interface, which may cause the list efficiency is low, but you can use;) - fireinice

# I got following error when opening a ticket.
Please let me know further information for analyse.

Hi! I just ran into the same (or similar?) problem. I was able to get it working by changing the following lines in jira.el (around line 502):

     ;;; Original broken code
     ;; (let ((s (jira-get-type-name (cdr (assoc "type" issue)))))
     ;;   (put-text-property 0 (length s) 'face 'jira-issue-info-face s)
     ;;   (insert s "\n"))

     ;; rml new version, Wed Nov 28 16:06:59 EST 2012
     (let ((s (cdr (assoc "type" issue))))
       (put-text-property 0 (length s) 'face 'jira-issue-info-face s)
       (insert s "\n"))

This allows me to call up issues without an error.

# Question: Is there a git repo or project page where I can submit patches? In addition to the one above, I've had to fix another little bug in order to get this to work on new JIRAs, but now it's working fine (I'm the guy from the next bullet up)
