[[OpenDocument]] text files carry the <code>.odt</code> extension.   Emacs provides varied support for working with such files.

==Create==
[[OrgMode]] files can be exported to OpenDocumentText. You need Org >= 7.8 or Emacs >= 24.1.

==View and edit==

Since 2006 there is  preliminary support for viewing and editing OpenDocument files with Emacs using [http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/lisp/editing/odf-mode.el odf-mode].  YMMV :-)

==Convert==

Use [https://bitbucket.org/josemaria.alkala/odt2org/wiki/Home odt2org] to convert ODT files to OrgMode. The tool is Python-based and can handle lists, links, images, tables etc. 

Once a document is exported as an <code>.org</code> file, converting it to other file formats like HTML, PDF, LaTeX, DocBook, MediaWiki is quite a breeze.
