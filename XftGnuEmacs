With XFT support, GnuEmacs is able to use anti-aliased fonts in the X11 UI
since version 23.1, released on 2009-07-29. Note that GnuEmacs already
supported anti-aliased fonts for the Carbon and W32 UIs before.

== Status ==

Xft support is included and enabled by default since emacs 23.1.


== Debian Prerequisites ==

A GNOME emacs from cvs for Debian:

  $ sudo aptitude install build-essential gnome-dev libxpm-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libgtk2.0-dev

(Watch out! The above command caused the gdm package to get uninstalled, along with a bunch of gnome packages, which meant X does not even invoke upon reboot. I am trying to figure out why via a  [http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=179966#179966 Debian Forum posting].)

For Ubuntu with all the extra goodies:

  $ sudo aptitude install build-essential libxpm-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libjpeg-dev libgtk2.0-dev libdbus-1-dev texinfo

== Configuration ==

Your ./configure invocation should resemble the following:

  $ ./configure --with-x-toolkit --with-xft

Check the output of this script to make sure that the required libraries 
were found on your system and Xft is enabled.  You may also need to specify the --prefix=some_installation_directory option.

You may also need to add an X resource setting to get emacs to use the
Xft renderer. You can place this line in your .Xresources file:

  emacs.FontBackend: xft

Or you can use this command to set it for the current X display:

  $ echo "Emacs.FontBackend: xft" | xrdb -merge

== Compilation ==

If this is the first time you've built emacs, or if you had build errors on
your last try, you should use:

  $ make bootstrap

Otherwise just

  $ make all

Regardless of using either make bootstrap or make all, install it with

  $ make install

== Choosing Fonts ==

Note that selection of Xft fonts through the user interface is not yet
working at the time of writing --- presumably there's a lot of X
ilLogical Font Description code to be worked around. ;-) 

You can specify a default font from the command line like so:

  $ emacs --font "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-10"

Setting X resources appears to work as well:

  Emacs.font: Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-8

If you want to use bold font, use "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-10:bold"
or "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-10:weight=bold". You can even do it in
your InitFile.

    (set-default-font "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-14")
    (set-fontset-font (frame-parameter nil 'font)
      'han '("cwTeXHeiBold" . "unicode-bmp"))

=== Emacs menubar on X11 with Xt ===

To set the font of the menubar when the GUI was compiled using the X toolkit (Xt) intrinsics (such as an Athena (Xaw) variant or Motif, for example, rather than GTK+ or Qt), the resource `emacs.pane.menubar.font` can be used.  Set it using a FontConfig pattern if Emacs was compiled with Xft, otherwise use an Xfs fontspec:

  ! Xft:
  emacs.pane.menubar.font: PragmataPro 9
  
  ! Xfs:
  emacs.pane.menubar.font: -*-anonymous pro-medium-r-*-9-*

Remember to run `xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources` after editing the file to have the X server refresh its resource database.  You may need to quit and re-start Emacs for the changes to take effect.

The `editres` program that comes with Xorg can be used to determine the appropriate resource and dynamically set its value even while Emacs is running.

The `xfontsel` program can be used to determine a proper Xfs fontspec for a given font (note that a suffix of multiple `-*` attribute wildcards can be flattened into a single wildcard, as shown above).

See the `FcPatternFormat(3)` manpage for a description of FontConfig patterns.



== Fixed problems ==

=== FreeBSD support ===

Use *gmake* rather than *make* to compile on !FreeBSD.

=== UI widgets ===

By default the scrollbars use the toolkit that has been specified on
the configure command line. Some distros might require special flags
for this. For example, Gentoo  requires a
<code>-toolkit-scroll-bars</code> use flag to get a GTK scroll bar.

If you encounter a monochromatic toolbar, be sure to have libxpm
dev-headers installed.

=== 100% CPU usage ===

A solution to the 100% CPU usage is mentioned here:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/2006-10/msg00016.html 
I applied the patch at
http://cedet.cvs.sourceforge.net/cedet/cedet/semantic/semantic-idle.el?r1=1.34&r2=1.35
and now emacs-cvs-23 works fine.

Please update this section with further occurrences of this behaviour.

=== Font specification/quality ===

Fonts can be specified on the command line, in
<code>.Xresources</code> or in <code>.emacs</code>.

With the GTK UI, it is possible that settings are being picked up from
somewhere in your environment, most likely gnome-settings-daemon,
whereas urxvt and Emacs are not, and are using the default system-wide
xft settings. Try setting the X resources Xft.dpi, Xft.hinting,
Xft.hintstyle, etc., or fooling with settings in ~/.fonts.conf or
system-wide settings in /etc/fonts/

On SUSE 10.3, the default hinting for Xft is hintfull (from 
/etc/fonts/suse-hinting.conf), which looks bad (at least it does for me).
I prefer hintslight, my ~/.fonts.conf:

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
 <match target="pattern" >
  <edit mode="assign" name="rgba" >
   <const>rgb</const>
  </edit>

  <edit mode="assign" name="hinting" >
   <bool>true</bool>
  </edit>

  <edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle" >
   <const>hintslight</const>
  </edit>

  <edit mode="assign" name="antialias" >
   <bool>true</bool>
  </edit>
 </match>
</fontconfig>
</pre>

Note <match target="pattern"> as opposed to <match target="font"> is 
necessary, otherwise apparently emacs ignores the settings for the 
actual editor font (although GTK applies them to the menu bar etc).

There was a problem with some weight (bold) not being visible. Setting
the X server colour depth to 24 seems to have resolved this problem.

If one frame uses the specified font but new frames don't, add

    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Bitstream Vera Sans
Mono-10"))

to your InitFile.

If you're having trouble with latin characters being displayed in a
different font, try the following, which is mentioned in passing at
the end of README.unicode:

    (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'latin '("arial" . "unicode-bmp"))

If you're having trouble with the euro symbol â‚¬ character being
displayed in a different font, try the following:

    (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'gb18030 '("dejavu sans mono" . "unicode-bmp"))

Or, to change ONLY the Euro symbol (or any other specific characters
that aren't covered by a suitable predefined charset or script), try
something along the lines of

    (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" '(#x20ac . #x20ac) '("dejavu sans mono" . "unicode-bmp"))

where the hexadecimal numbers are the first and last Unicode codepoints you want to affect.

[Note: for all of the above suggestions, you should replace the font name with the one that
you want...]

=== Memory leaks ===

The MEMFULL errors have been fixed in CVS. 

=== Background colour ===

The problem where the area of the window not covered by text is grey
(window background color) as reported
[http://uncle-toby.livejournal.com/9536.html here] seems to have been
a gtk-qt problem it is fixed. See
[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1539310&postcount=78 this]
!UbuntuForum post.

=== Indic font support ===

The support for Devanagari, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam are
correct as far as I can see. There might be bugs in the font
encodings. See SupportHindi.

== Unfixed problems ==

Has anyone noticed that buttons (links) blink much more than in Emacs
22? For example in irc #emacs via erc, there are so many user name
buttons that Emacs 23 is using quite a bit of CPU and the window
flickers once in a while. I try to track down this bug, but I don't
know how to get more details for the developers to fix it. -- Leo

I find a recipe to see the bug. "C-u 3 2 M-x hanoi" you can see the
screen is acting weirdly.

All I get is square outlines, and aliased fonts otherwise (latest code
on the branch as of today). libxft and libxft-dev are installed,
ttf-bitstream-vera as well, current Debian Sid amd64. What are
directions for troubleshooting and fixing? Is this branch going to be
merged into trunk and part of an official release eventually? More
than a year since this was started and there's still no consumer ready
binary package? Emacs is the last app on my desktop not using AA
fonts, I am starting to notice.

I got it working for the most part, but the Italic and Bold Italic
faces aren't anti-aliased, even though they seem to be with the same
font (see the screenshot below).  Any ideas?

: I fixed this by adding <tt>Emacs.fontBackend: xft</tt> to my .Xresources.

For set-fontset-font, I can find a list of charset (latin-iso-8859-1,
etc) with list-character-sets, but I can't find a list of scripts
(han, etc). charset-script-alist lists some scripts, but I've ran
across .emacs snippets that use script names not on that list (like
cjk-misc). Where can I find the whole list?

Starting emacs with

emacs -fn "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-12" -g 80x40

doesn't show a frame with 80 columns width, but a frame with 66 columns width.

emacs -g 80x40

i.e. starting emacs without using true type fonts shows the frame with the correct width: 80 columns.

I did not get these when I compiled from CVS two days ago.  Is this
because of my local settings, or did something change in the CVS tree? 
I see no notes in the Changelog JoelAdamson

I only get things properly displayed with "DejaVu Mono-10":

With all other truetype fonts dired, calendar and so on, look a little
weird:

''A.''  I think what's happened here is that the font specification
doesn't match an actual font on your system, so a fallback font is
used instead. In this case it is variable-width and it has thrown out
the alignment of your calendar. Try one of the interactive methods of
choosing fonts -- that way you'll be sure to pick one that's
displayable.

JohnBrow got it to run under Fedora 8, looks very nice.  After
checking the source out of CVS he had to do "yum install gtk-*" to
pull all the required development packages in for the ./configure
command to work.
