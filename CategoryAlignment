There are facilities provided by emacs to align text, comments, assignments, or columns.

* AlignCommands explains how to use the <code>align</code>, <code>align-current</code> and <code>align-regexp</code> commands provided with emacs.


* AlignColumn deals with the <code>align.el</code> extension written by
Matthias Helmling. Do not confuse with the align.el lisp file
provided with recent emacs versions and described above.

* BackspaceWhitespaceToTabStop
  
* ColumnizeWords is an extension written by [[Rick_Bielawski]]. It provides the
<code>columnize-text</code> command, which lines up words or numbers, 
either by rows or columns.  This function is designed to be used manually
when editing buffers.

  
* AlignLet is meant to align <code>let</code> assignments in Lisp code.
  The align-let.el extension is written by Kevin Ryde.



<b>Other ways to align text or figures</b>

[English:CategoryTables Tables] can also be used to line up text. 
The extension <code>table.el</code>, by
Takaaki Ota is now available by default with emacs22. 

Converting text
to table gives access to a number of neat formatting features from
TableMode. The next example is obtained by capturing a short text with
<code>M-x table-capture</code>, using space as the column delimiter
and a newline as the row delimiter (the newline can be entered by
hitting <code>C-q C-j</code> or <code>C-o</code>). The table is then
removed with <code>M-x table-release</code>, leaving the default left
alignment.
