As you must have noticed, system recovery has been taken quite some time. Currently the wiki runs under [http://oddmuse.org/wiki/Using_mod_perl mod_perl and ModPerl::Registry]. My notes are [https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2014-12-19_Emacs_Wiki_Migration on my blog].

There are many things that still don't work:

# git integration (some issues regarding a cleanup that was planned)
# backup (due to permission issues which I haven't been able to look into)
# frequent outages (the page comes up empty) -- I'm not sure what is happening, here: processes crashing? taking too long?
# broken reloads after editing a page (but trying again solves the problem)
# we lost foreign language support (at the top it will always say SiteMap even if your browser preferences are for a different language)

And there are probably many more. I haven't looked at the ElispArea, RSS feeds, all the cron jobs, etc. Yikes!
