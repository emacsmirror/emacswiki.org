This mode changes mark behaviour to emulate Motif, MAC or MS-Windows cut and paste style.
(DeleteSelectionMode and TransientMarkMode are also enabled.)

This allows you to use the `<code>S-<left></code>' and `<code>S-<right></code>' to extend or shrink the region.  Ditto for `<code>C-S-<left></code>' and `<code>C-S-<right></code>' as well as lots of other combinations well known from the Windows 3.11 world.  My favorite is `<code>S-<insert></code>', `<code>C-<insert></code>', and `<code>S-<delete></code>' to paste, copy, and cut the region.

Those key bindings are also available from DeleteSelectionMode and TransientMarkMode. -- DrewAdams

<code>pc-selection-mode</code> is only defined in GnuEmacs.  For [[XEmacs]], load the pc-select file.  In order to make it work for both emacsen, put the following in your <code>~/.emacs</code> file:

    (if (fboundp 'pc-selection-mode)
        (pc-selection-mode)
      (require 'pc-select))

My PcSelectionMode is working for emacs-22 in an XWindow console but it's not working for emacs-22 in a tty console (Ctrl Alt F2 or F3...). In a tty console, it does copy but it does not delete and does not reverse the video. I tried the both hacks below:

 (if (fboundp 'pc-selection-mode)                                              
      (pc-selection-mode)                                                   
      (require 'pc-select))   

 (custom-set-variables
  '(pc-selection-mode t nil (pc-select))

I believe it is called shift-select-mode now.
