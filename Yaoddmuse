Comprehensive Emacs integration with Oddmuse wikis (like Emacswiki)
which enables fast browsing, authoring and editing of wiki pages from
within Emacs.  All up/download commands are asynchronous for fast
transfers.

Yaoddmuse stands for "Yet Another Oddmuse Mode" for Emacs. It is a
rewrite of the oddmuse.el code with modularity and extensibility in
mind. 

: Please send suggestions and bug reports to [[rubikitch]], he's the new maintainer. Thanks! -- AndyStewart

==Why yaoddmuse.el ?==
# *The goal* of yaoddmuse mode is to help increase both the amount and
quality of documentation and code on Emacswiki, by making it easy,
quick and comfortable to contribute your ideas, edits, elisp fragments
and libraries---all from within Emacs.  
# *As with oddmuse*, yaoddmuse lets you use powerful features of Emacs
(like dired file marking and quick load-edit-update cycles) to *make
multiple edits easy.*
# *Asynchronous processing.* The default package for editing oddmuse
pages, Lisp:oddmuse.el, is great for editing or posting Oddmuse wiki
pages, but it handles wiki pages with synchronous processes.  This
means that the user has to wait for Emacs to finish loading or saving
before he can do anything in emacs.  'yaoddmuse.el' is rewritten
(using `url-retrieve'), which enables downloading and posting
asynchronously, so you can do your work and handle wiki pages at the
same time.  This makes a difference when you are handling big pages or
multiple pages.

# *Advanced commands.* yaoddmuse.el provides some advanced commands
for fast posting of wiki pages.
# *Better syntax highlighting.* yaoddmuse.el enhances the syntax
highlight features of Lisp:oddmuse.el.
# *Compatible with Oddmuse.* yaoddmuse.el has all the features of
Lisp:oddmuse.el.  You won't miss your favorite features of oddmuse.el

==Installation==
* Put Lisp:yaoddmuse.el in your load-path, and then add the following
to your ~/.emacs:
{{{
    (require 'yaoddmuse)
}}}

* If your computer is always connected Internet when Emacs starts up,
: You can add the following to your ~/.emacs.  It updates the list of
Wiki pages at start up: 
{{{
     (yaoddmuse-update-pagename t)
}}}

: This line is optional, since Yaoddmuse will automatically
: update its list of Wiki page names when you call yaoddmuse for the
first time.
: The advantage of the above setup is that it avoids a *delay* when
you first call the function.

==Usage==
* To edit your first EmacsWiki page:
## M-x yaoddmuse-edit-default RET, input page name you want edit.
## Yaoddmuse will download the current page content. Then edit page
using Oddmuse Markup (See TextFormattingRules)
## Type "C-u C-c C-c" when your edits are complete. 
## Write your summary for the modifications, typically something like
"Update".
: That's all.  Yaoddmuse will view your edited page after a successful
post.

* To view a wiki page:
## M-x yaoddmuse-browse-page-default RET
## Input page name that you want view.
: If wiki page is image page, it will decode image and view it. (You
can test image page: YaoddmuseExamplePicture)

* To upload your first package:
: Want to upload your packages to EmacsWiki fast? Do the following:
## C-u M-x yaoddmuse-post-library-default RET, 'input library name'
## Type your summary for this post, typically something like
"Created".
: Yaoddmuse will view the page after a successful library post. 
: Simple, no?

* To upload picture or compress file:
: Upload picture or compress file directly in Emacs; you don't need the browser
anymore!
## C-u M-x yaoddmuse-post-file-default RET
## Input picture or compress file path
## Type page name for this post.
## Write  your summary for the modifications.
: Yaoddmuse will view page after a successful post.
: Of course, yaoddmuse-post-file-default can post any type file.
: [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=mimetypes Here] have
file type that EmacsWiki allowed upload.

* To upload screenshot:
: It's true, you can screenshot and then upload it. Do the following:
## C-u M-x yaoddmuse-post-screenshot-default RET
## Use mouse select region that you want screenshot
## Input upload page, typically something like
"YaoddmuseExamplePicture".
: That's all, Yaoddmuse will view picture page after post successful.
: Cool? :)

: The local directory to store oddmuse pages.  This is created if it
does not exist.

* "yaoddmuse-assoc-mode" 
: Whether to associate files in "yaoddmuse-directory' with
`yaoddmuse-mode".
: You can set this value with `nil' if you don't want to associate
these with `yaoddmuse-mode".

* "yaoddmuse-wikis" 
: Is alist mapping wiki names to URLs.
: You can add Oddmuse wikis element in the format: ("WikiName"
"WikiUrl" coding "Captcha").
: But don't modified default element of `yaoddmuse-wikis', change
probably causes trouble!

* "yaoddmuse-default-wiki" 
: The default wiki for the command "yaoddmuse-edit-default".

* "yaoddmuse-username" 
: User name for posting. Default is the value of "user-full-name".

* "yaoddmuse-password" 
: Password for posting,
You only need this if you want to edit locked pages and you have an
administrator password.

* "yaoddmuse-close-after-post" 
: Whether to close the edit buffer after posting a wiki page.

* "yaoddmuse-post-dired-confirm" 
: Whether confirmation is needed to post dired-marked files.

* "yaoddmuse-edit-protect" 
: Some wikis, such as EmacsWiki,
use a text 'captcha' to protect pages from being edited.
This option enables a user to post to wiki pages without using the
captcha.
So if you edit a wiki (such as EmacsWiki),
please make sure this option is "non-nil".

* "yaoddmuse-use-always-minor" 
: When t, set all the minor mode bit to all editions.

* "yaoddmuse-browse-function"
: You can customize your own advanced function for browsing wiki
pages.  The default is "browse-url".
: You can find my customized browse function in
Lisp:yaoddmuse-extension.el

* `yaoddmuse-notify-function' 
: The default notify function for get/post message.
: You can find my customize notify function in
Lisp:yaoddmuse-extension.el

* "yaoddmuse-highlight-elisp-page"

current page is an elisp file.
: If you don't like this, change it to `nil'.

* `yaoddmuse-screenshot-program'
: The default tool program for screenshot.

* `yaoddmuse-screenshot-filename'
: The default file for save screenshot.

==Tips==
* Get the page whose name is around point:
: Command `yaoddmuse-follow' tries to get a valid page link around
point. If it is found it loads the page for editing, otherwise it
returns: "No link found at point." 
: If you type "C-u" before you call this command, it will let you edit
the page name before loading the page. 

* Reload or switch edit page:
: When you use command `yaoddmuse-edit' or `yaoddmuse-edit-default',
it will prefer to switch edit page if already have one exist. 
: If you want to reload edit page forcibly, just hit "C-u" before
executing the command.

* Smart display edit page. 
: Default, edit page buffer *popup* when current major-mode is not
`yaoddmuse-mode', or use *switch* edit page buffer when current
major-mode is `yaoddmuse-mode'.

* Revert edited page:
: The command `yaoddmuse-revert' reverts current edited page, without
requiring wiki name or page name.

* Browse page after successful post:
: If you type "C-u" before call post command, yaoddmuse will present
the page for browsing after a successful post.

* Post buffer to wiki:
: The command `yaoddmuse-post-buffer' posts a specified buffer to
wiki.  Alternately, you can use the command
`yaoddmuse-post-current-buffer' to post the current buffer to wiki.

* Post file to wiki:
: The command `yaoddmuse-post-file' posts a specified file to a wiki. 
It's useful for fast posting when you don't want open file.

* Post marked files in dired to wiki:
: The command `yaoddmuse-post-dired' posts dired-marked files to a
wiki, this command is useful when you want to update many files to the
wiki.

* Post library to wiki:
: Command `yaoddmuse-post-library' and
`yaoddmuse-post-library-default' will post specified library to a
wiki.  It finds the local path automatically, if you're feeling lazy. 

* Remember last summary:
: By default, yaoddmuse remembers the last `summary' string. If you
want the same summary as the previous time, just hit RET.

* Toggle edit mode:
: You can use command `yaoddmuse-toggle-minor' to toggle edit mode
state, if you just do *small* changes, please switch to *minor edits*
state.
: By default, Yaoddmuse will notify current edit status at mode-line.

* Pick up file name:
: By default, when you use command `yaoddmuse-post-library' and
`yaoddmuse-post-library-default', those commands can pick up file name
around point, if it's library name you want, just hit RET.  ;)

* Pick up page name:
: When you use commands `yaoddmuse-browse-page' or
`yaoddmuse-browse-page-default', it will try to pick-up page name
around point.

* Encode speical file:
: If you post speical file, such as picture or compress file, it can
encode file content before post it.

* Redirect page:
: You can use command `yaoddmuse-redirect' redirect page. Just input
page name that you want redirect to. You need input redirect from page
if current buffer not `yaoddmuse' buffer.

* Delete page:
: You can use command `yaoddmuse-delete' delete page. Just input page
name that you want delete.

* Insert special file:
: You can use command `yaoddmuse-insert-file-content' insert file
content. This command will try to encode special file content, such
as, picture or compress file.

* Save page:
: You can use command `yaoddmuse-save-as' save special page, such as
picture or compress format, and it will notify you correct suffix to
save.

* Toggle image view:
: By default, when got image page, it will decode image and view it.
You can use command `yaoddmuse-toggle-image-status' to toggle image
status for view different content.

* Integrate with [[Yasnippet]]:
:: I recommand you integrate [[Yaoddmuse]] with [[Yasnippet]], then
you can fast insert Wiki template, see TextFormattingRules for Oddmuse
Markup.
::
[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/AndyStewart_YasnippetTemplate#toc4
Here] have my yasnippet template code for Yaoddmuse mode.

* Lisp:yaoddmuse-extension.el has some enhanced functions for
Yaoddmuse.
** Function `yaoddmuse-browse-page-in-w3m' is an enhanced function to
replace the default browse function (`browse-url) in
Lisp:yaoddmuse.el. By default, `browse-url' just opens a *new* buffer.
`yaoddmuse-browse-page-in-w3m' will search for an *existing* buffer
containing the page, and update that instead of duplicating the page
in w3m. It's very useful when you edit a lot of pages in a single
session. 
:: Setup like below:
{{{
            (setq yaoddmuse-browse-function 'yaoddmuse-browse-page-in-w3m)
}}}
** `yaoddmuse-w3m-edit-emacswiki-page' is a lazy function. You can use
this function to edit the EmacsWiki page displayed in the current w3m
buffer without entering the page name.
** Command `yaoddmuse-yasnippet-insert-file' and
`yaoddmuse-yasnippet-insert-directory' can fast transform
[[Yasnippet]] template code with EmacsWiki format and insert it. So
you can update your [[Yasnippet]] template fast, handy to sharing with
others. :) 
** Function `yaoddmuse-notify-popup-window' use program `notify-send'
notify yaoddmuse message. 
:: Setup like below:
{{{
            (setq yaoddmuse-notify-function
                  'yaoddmuse-notify-popup-window)
}}}
* Integration with [[ToDoChiKu]]:
** The latest version of todochiku integrates with yaoddmuse to provide
the same notifications as yaoddmuse-notify-popup-window, except it can
use notify-send, growl, snarl, a tooltip, or even just an emacs message
to display a notiication.   If you have Todochiku >= 0.7:
{{{
       (require 'todochiku)
       (setq yaoddmuse-notify-function 'yaoddmuse-todochiku)
}}}
* Integration with [[Anything]]:
** Install:
:: Put Lisp:anything.el and Lisp:anything-config.el in your
load-path, then add
{{{
        (require 'anything)
}}}
:: in your ~/.emacs
** Usage:
### You can use the command
`anything-yaoddmuse-emacswiki-edit-or-view' to edit or view an
EmacsWiki page. If you don't see anything, just wait for Yaoddmuse to
update the list of page names (for autocomplete) and try again.
### You can use the command
`anything-yaoddmuse-emacswiki-post-library' to post a library on
EmacsWiki. 
### Or you can integrate this package with [[Anything]], just setup
like this:
{{{
            (setq anything-sources
                  (list
                   anything-c-source-yaoddmuse-emacswiki-edit-or-view
                   anything-c-source-yaoddmuse-emacswiki-post-library
                   ))
}}}
** Tips:
### When you use [[Anything]] interface, you can type "TAB" to switch
second-level interface for more command for same candidate.

I do not see why you did not send patches to OddMuse instead of
"forking". Some ideas could be contributed to OddMuse, that would be
perfect.
[new:AndyStewart:2009-01-12 20:14 UTC]
: If you see source code of oddmuse.el, you will find there have big
different between oddmuse.el and yaoddmuse.el, because oddmuse.el use
`url-retrieve-synchronous' to handle wiki page, so it will hang emacs
when it work, and fix this problem need `url-retrieve' and use unique
buffer to hande. And those chnage not just a patch to oddmuse.el, need
rewrite all module for hande *asynchronous* process. And the patch's
size is bigger than size of oddmuse.el, and will make the code of
oddmus.el became *dirty*, i need *clear* and *module* code to add new
feature (like post command). So i rewrite new one.  -- AndyStewart

Any bug reports or advice are welcome! Please write your idea or bug
below. I will add or fix it. Or mail to me. :) -- AndyStewart

A little note on the 'minor' not appearing on my mode line: I am using
23.0.91. I start using 'emacs --quick', then I do:

{{{
(setq default-mode-line-format
      (append default-mode-line-format
	      (list "more text")))
}}}

like you do in yaoddmuse.  This ain't gonna work because
default-mode-line-format ends with "-%-" which spans as far as it can.
Maybe this wasn't the case before 23 and nobody else tried yaoddmuse
on 23?! Without investigating this any furthur I believe you should
append to global-mode-string instead. It is part of
default-mode-line-format, just before the "-%-". You might have to
make it buffer local, I do not know.

[new:AndyStewart:2009-03-31 01:32 UTC]
: I use 23.0.91.1, i can display edit status on the mode-line, see screenshot YaoddmuseEditStatusScreenshot, i think mode-line-format is right place for update status on the mode-line, because it is buffer-local default. And have another guy send me mail for same problem, unfortunately, i haven't find cause that those code can't work. If someone find solution, please contact me. Thanks! -- AndyStewart

A quick question: Shouldn't ThingAtPoint be required by
yaoddmuse? Without requiring thingatpt.el the function word-at-point
on line 1636 results in a void-function error. Thanks! MattLundin

: Yep, yaoddmuse.el need thingatpt.el for get word around current point. -- AndyStewart

I am having problems trying to access a private wiki (as explained [http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/Private_Wiki here]). I get garbage for my list of possible page name completions:

Possible completions are:
"-//W3C//DTD
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
/><link 	/><meta
1.0 	<!DOCTYPE
<html 	PUBLIC
Required</h1><p><a 	Strict//EN"
XHTML 	charset=UTF-8"/></head><body
class="error"><h1>Password

and even if I give it a valid page name I get this error: "Get page 'HomePage' form 'MyWiki' failed."
If I make the wiki public there are no problems, and if I make it private again in the same emacs session (after accessing it as a public wiki) I can still access it as normal. 

[new:Memnon Anon:2010-01-22 12:48 UTC]
Hi, I just started using yaoddmuse (again), so sorry if this is a stupid question.
I just delete my old Homepage with yaoddmuse-delete. I kind of expected a way to 
enter a comment (like it is [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MinorEdit suggested]]), but
there was no prompt. Probably, I had used yaoddmuse-toogle-minor previously. Is there
any way to have yaoddmuse-delete //always// prompt me for a comment, regardless of the 
minor state? If there is one, is there a reason this is not default? I think no matter which
wiki you edit, deleting a page demands for an explanation, no?

[new]
Is there any way to preview the on-going editing page in browser? -- Kiwon Um

[new:stepnem:2010-04-21 09:28 UTC]
I've been thinking about that, too... and you finally made me actually do it! (-;

Try this:
<http://github.com/stepnem/emacs-libraries/raw/priv/yaoddmuse.el>

It contains some other fixes, too; but I don't use Yaoddmuse that often, and
when I do, then it's only a small part of its functionality, so it might need some
testing. Comments welcome (best via e-mail or IRC).

[new]
Please, the code should contain a way for detect if the user is at a
text console, like I usually do.  --SuSo

[new:MatthewSnyder:2013-01-22 16:15 UTC]

Is there a way to tell Yaoddmuse to create a page upon follow if it doesn't exist?
