Damn, this page is  nightmare.

I'm going to rework it at some point:

* pointer to explanatory scope page
* emacs24 lexical scope
* dynamic scope
* how the 2 interract, especially let binding things

: Each use of `let' creates a fresh location, even if you use the same name:

      (let ((a 1))
        (let ((a 2))
           (let ((a 3))
             (print a))
           (print a))
        (print a))
        ==> 3
            2
            1

Know little about elisp. But the result of this expression is as follows on my Emacs(24.3).  So am I missing something?

(Moved HongxuChen's comment here from main page.)

I think your question is "Why do I see an extra `1' at the end?"  If so, the answer is that when you evaluated the `let' form you probably used something like `##M-:##', that is, some command that, itself, prints the result of the evaluation.  The `3 2 1' is printed by the `let' form, and the final `1' is printed by whatever command you used to evaluate the `let' form.
