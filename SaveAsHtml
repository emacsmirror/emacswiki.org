Mkhtml, by DrewAdams, lets you create hypertext-linked HTML output from Emacs buffers. It uses the [[Htmlize]] library by HrvojeNiksic.

Htmlize, by itself, creates HTML (without links) that corresponds to any font-lock-using Emacs buffer.  The HTML uses CSS, which reflects the
definitions of the font-lock [[Face]]s you are using.

Mkhtml adds preservation of links to the functionality provided by Htmlize: It interprets mouse-face'd text in Info and Dired buffers as links. These Emacs links then become hypertext links in the output HTML.

In ''Info'', Mkhtml adds these items to the MenuBar '''Info''' menu:
* '''HTMLize Buffer''' (`mkhtml-info-buffer') -- Save the current Info buffer as a new HTML file (named after the Info node).
* '''HTMLize Whole Info File''' (`mkhtml-file') -- Create a new HTML file for ''each node'' in the current Info ''file'' (whole manual).

The Info mouse-face links are converted to HTML links.

In ''DiredMode'', Mkhtml adds this item to the menu-bar '''Operate''' and '''Immediate''' menus:
* '''Create HTML''' (`mkhtml-dired-files') -- Create an HTML file that corresponds to each marked (or pointed) file. DiredMode mouse-face links are converted to HTML links.

In buffers other than `Info' and `Dired', Mkhtml adds item '''HTMLize Buffer''' (`mkhtml-info-buffer') to the menu-bar '''Tools''' menu.

Mkhtml works with GnuEmacs 20; it has not been tested with Emacs 21 or more recent.
