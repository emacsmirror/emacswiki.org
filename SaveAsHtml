Mkhtml, by DrewAdams, lets you create hypertext-linked HTML output from Emacs buffers. It uses the [[Htmlize]] library by HrvojeNiksic.

Htmlize, by itself, creates HTML (without links) that corresponds to any font-lock-using Emacs buffer.  The HTML uses CSS, which reflects the
definitions of the font-lock [[Face]]s you are using.

Mkhtml adds preservation of links to the functionality provided by Htmlize: It interprets mouse-face'd text in Info and Dired buffers as links. These Emacs links then become hypertext links in the output HTML.

In ''Info'', Mkhtml adds these items to the MenuBar '''Info''' menu:
* '''HTMLize Buffer''' (`mkhtml-info-buffer') -- Save the current Info buffer as a new HTML file (named after the Info node).
* '''HTMLize Whole Info File''' (`mkhtml-file') -- Create a new HTML file for ''each node'' in the current Info ''file'' (whole manual).

The Info mouse-face links are converted to HTML links.

In ''DiredMode'', Mkhtml adds this item to the menu-bar '''Operate''' and '''Immediate''' menus:
* '''Create HTML''' (`mkhtml-dired-files') -- Create an HTML file that corresponds to each marked (or pointed) file. DiredMode mouse-face links are converted to HTML links.

In buffers other than `Info' and `Dired', Mkhtml adds item '''HTMLize Buffer''' (`mkhtml-info-buffer') to the menu-bar '''Tools''' menu.

Mkhtml works with GnuEmacs 20; it has not been tested with Emacs 21 or more recent.

* Mkhtml: Lisp:mkhtml.el

Hey, mkhtml.el calls the function `htmlize-make-face-hash', that seems to have been dropped out of htmlize.el ages ago! Cheers :), EduardoOchs

Yeah, I know. I haven't really updated mkhtml.el in years. It works with an old version of htmlize.el. Maybe someday I'll get around to updating it. Sorry about that :-(. -- DrewAdams

your package mkhtml need package mktml-htmlize, but I can not found it, :-(. -- [[ahei]]

I just uploaded it: <tt>[[mkhtml-htmlize.el]]</tt>. See the `NOTE' I just added to the Commentary. MKHTML is very old. There are no doubt better things nowadays that do something similar. I posted MKHTML in case someone finds it useful. 

I used to use MKHTML a lot, and it worked well for what it did. I no longer maintain it, and it does not work with recent versions of ##htmlize.el##. (If someone else wants to maintain MKHTML and bring it up to date, they are welcome to -- let me know.) Personally, I no longer have any need to create HTML pages from text files, code files, [[Dired]] buffers, and [[InfoMode|Info]] pages. If you need to do that, then it might be that MKHTML is still the best thing for that -- dunno.

I posted ##mkhtml-htmlize.el## only for use with MKHTML. It is simply an old version of ##htmlize.el##, the version that I believe I was using with <tt>[[mkhtml.el]]</tt>, back when I used that.  I thought I had posted it before (perhaps someone deleted it). Sorry for any confusion.  HTH.  -- DrewAdams

mkhtml does not wok well in emacs 22 and 23, but thank you all the way. -- [[ahei]]

OK, thanks for the info. I'm not surprised. It probably needs a little tweaking.  -- DrewAdams
