ClojureMode is a major mode that provides font-lock, indentation, and functions for communication with subprocesses for [http://clojure.org Clojure].

It's more useful if used together with swank-clojure to interact with subprocesses. See http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Emacs for a tutorial (older tutorial at: http://technomancy.us/126)
