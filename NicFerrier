I am [::nicferrier], a hacker trying to do interesting things. I use Emacs every day all the time. [[http://nic.ferrier.me.uk|Here's my blog]].


I've used Emacs in some form since 1989. And GNU-Emacs every day, all the time for the last 15 years. I've done extensive Java, C, Python, ActionScript and Shell development inside Emacs, as well as a bunch of other languages. 

The last couple of years I've started to look at ELisp as a practical language (since it had closures basically) in which I might //one day// do all my work.

== About me ==

I work for [[http://bwinparty.com|BwinParty Gaming]] as the Chief Technical Architect.

I used to work for ThoughtWorks, teaching people how to get shit live. Before that I was the CTO of woome.com where we built web video tools to help people get laid.

I've just started the [[http://emacstapas.com|Emacs Tapas]], a series of screencasts about programming in Emacs and EmacsLisp. I would like to help more people learn Emacs as a second language so they can build tools for themselves.

I maintain the [[http://marmalade-repo.org|marmalade Emacs package repo]] and am porting it to [[Elnode]] [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade|here]] and it's running in draft state [[http://marmalade-repo.ferrier.me.uk|here]]

I am the author and maintainer of [[Elnode]], the Emacs Async Webserver; more information about that in this page.

I hang out on [[EmacsChannel|#emacs]] a lot, I'm listed [[EmacsChannelPeople|here]] and [[EmacsChannelDemographics|here]].  I wish that both of those references could be auto-generated.

Check out my [[http://nic.ferrier.me.uk#emacslisp|blog]] which has lots of stuff about Emacs.

== Things I do with Emacs that are interesting ==

=== Use Emacs for Google Talk ===
I started talking to people who use Google Talk so I started to use JabberEl and GoogleTalk - it's a breeze actually.

=== Use an IRC Bouncer in EmacsLisp ===
I wrote ShoesOff because an IRC bouncer in EmacsLisp was obvious. I use it a lot.

I run a laptop at home with ShoesOff running all the time. 

I have a NAT forwarded port on my home router to the bouncer port on the laptop so I can connect to ShoesOff even when I am not at home. 

My home connection is reliable enough that this is rarely a problem. 

=== Frame size ===
Changing font size is a pain so I wrote [[FrameSize]], it's now a major part of my workflow.

=== Read my Email under Emacs ===
I've read my Email in Emacs since 1999 and I have always used my own email client which has changed over time as email has changed.

Right now I use an IMAP free solution but am considering switching to an IMAP fetch solution.

My current MUA is [[http://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-maildir|Emacs Maildir]]

=== Building Emacs from source ==
I mostly always build Emacs from source (though I think the emacs-snapshot packages are great) so I use this [[EmacsSnapshotAndDebian|page]] to track what I need to do.

Here is how to get a git clone of Emacs these days:

{{{
git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs -b emacs-24
}}}

You can also clone these tags:

* emacs-24.3 - stable 24.3
* emacs-24.3.91 - approaching 24.4, quite unstable, lots of changes sadly

== Elnode: an asynchronous HTTP server for Emacs ==
// ... or node.js for Emacs //

[[Elnode]] is an asynchronous TCP server handling HTTP.

Elnode is in the [http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/elnode marmalade repository]

As of now Elnode is functional. I am starting to write things with it:

* a pastebin style collabarative editor
* [[http://teamchat.net|TeamChat.net]] a ChatOps engine mashing up IRC, webapps and ChatBots.
* [[https://github.com/nicferrier/seville|the new version of Marmalade]] which would also be a reusable ELPA archive
* [[Elwiki]] an EmacsWiki engine

Other stuff I am considering:

* dynamic OrgAgenda export
* browser integration tools, for example an Emacs password store

== Creole ==

[[Creole]] is a Wiki markup language very like the one used here on [[Oddmuse|EmacsWiki]]. 

I develop and maintain the EmacsLisp version of a [[Creole]] [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikicreole|parser and HTML exporter]].

We are using [[Creole]] to develop [[Elwiki]], an EmacsWiki engine in EmacsLisp run with [[Elnode]].

 
== Emacs in a screen terminal: colors ==

I do some remote pair programming inside screen. I would like to use emacs. Standard colors are too difficult for me to read (my eyes are going!).

vim has the very nice: 

{{{
set background=dark
}}}

which turns up the brightness on dark font faces. According to #emacs we have no equivalent.

So I wrote one:

{{{
(defvar dark-background nil)

(defun toggle-dark-background ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((difficult-colors
         '("red" "blue" "medium blue")))
    (mapc
     (lambda (face)
       (and (member (face-attribute face :foreground)  difficult-colors)
            (set-face-bold-p face (not dark-background))))
     (face-list)))
  (setq dark-background (not dark-background)))
}}}  

This toggles bold on the dark ones, which I think is all the vim thing is doing.

== Project occur ==

Everyone needs a project occur. I have a good one for elisp inside [[Elpakit]] but I do a lot of webapp programming that isn't Elisp exclusive so I need a more general one.

[[NicFerrier_projectoccur|This page]] details my latest attempt at this.

== Config and Customize ==

[[NicFerrier_config|This page]] describes how I do my config which is somewhat interesting for a wierd section of the population who are obsessed with it.

== Packages For Config - Small, Portable Init Files ==

[:PackagesForConfig]Another interest of mine is achieving portable Emacs config.  My plan is to achieve this through use of packages.

The idea is to:

* put your config in a package and make it depend on the packages you are using
* whenever you install something re-check the depends in your config package and make a new package if necessary
* have a command to uninstall something, or to garbage collect no longer used dependancies
* installing your emacs elsewhere is just installing the config package
* encrypted packages would be useful for config
* separate config for machine specific things, this can be done with CustomizeThemes

[[https://gist.github.com/3159186|This gist]] shows my self installing Emacs config except for the customizations.  The customizations are insecure because they contain passwords and such, hence the need for encrypted packages.

Solving the problem of what is machine specific and what is not is hard.

== Gravatar from Emacs ==

The image above is my [[http://gravatar.com|Gravatar]]. It's a useful service that ties an email address to an image, so if someone gives you an email you can maybe find a picture of them.

You need to hash the email to generate the url though, here's how in EmacsLisp:

{{{
(print (md5 (downcase "nic@example.com")) (current-buffer))
}}}

== List of various other ELisp bits and pieces ==

I've done quite a few other packages for Emacs, most are on github but check these out:

* [[WikiDoc]] -- a program to make wiki documentation from Elisp functions, [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/wikidoc|marmalade repo here]], [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elwikidoc|github here]]
* fakir -- a library to make faking Emacs Lisp functions easier [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/fakir|marmalade repo here]], [[http://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-fakir|github here]]
 
And some other stuff I haven't packaged and probably never will:

* [[pastebin]] -- a simple interface to the [http://www.pastebin.com pastebin.com] webservice
* [[rcircPresence]] -- for syncing rcirc with some other presence thing (eg: skype)
* [[imapua]] -- a purely IMAP based email client for Emacs
* [[trac_editor]] -- a very simple interface to trac.py
* WorldTime -- showing a whole day of times
* [[tzhelp]] -- a small set of tools for dealing with timezones

== Emacs under Mercurial ==

I used to maintain a mercurial copy of the emacs bzr repo at [https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs bitbucket].

[https://bitbucket.org/nic/emacs-update/changeset/14a32e93c535 here is the update script I used].

I no longer maintain that, people weren't interested.
