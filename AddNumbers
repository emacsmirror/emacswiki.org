'''Add Numbers in a Column'''

This little function kills the [[rectangle]] between [[point]] and [[mark]] and reinserts it.  The rectangle is also inserted into a temporary [[buffer]], where all the numbers are added together.

 (defun calculator-sum-column (start end)
   "Adds numbers in rectangle."
   (interactive "r")
   (save-excursion
     (kill-rectangle start end)
     (exchange-point-and-mark)
     (yank-rectangle)
     (set-buffer (get-buffer-create "*calc-sum*"))
     (erase-buffer)
     (yank-rectangle)
     (exchange-point-and-mark-nomark)
     (let ((sum 0))
       (while (re-search-forward "[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+" nil t)
	 (setq sum (+ sum (string-to-number (match-string 0)))))
       (message "Sum: %f" sum))))

The code above used `exchange-point-and-mark-nomark' which is from pc-select-mode.  A user complained:

My Emacsen don't define exchange-point-and-mark-nomark, so I had to do

 (defun exchange-point-and-mark-nomark ()
   (exchange-point-and-mark nil))

I hope the code is fixed, now.  These -nomark functions should never be used in EmacsLisp source.  When I wrote it, I was still young and just checked the binding of C-x C-x... -- AlexSchroeder

My version of emacs (20.1) does not let you put `nil' after `exchange-point-and-mark'.  But if you omit the `nil', then when the function finishes, the rectangle is no longer marked.

To solve this problem, I modified the function somewhat.  Now, instead of [[kill]]ing and [[yank]]ing the rectangle (thus modifying the buffer), I just copy it to a [[register]].  Now, you don't need the nomark function, and you don't need to exchange-point-and-mark at all.

  (defun sum-column (start end)
    "Adds numbers in a rectangle"
    (interactive "r")
    (copy-rectangle-to-register 9 start end)
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create "*calc-sum*"))
    (erase-buffer)
    (insert-register 9)
    (let ((sum 0))
      (while (re-search-forward "-?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+" nil t)
        (setq sum (+ sum (string-to-number (match-string 0)))))
      (message "Sum: %f" sum)))

'''Or Just Use Emacs Calc'''

The column of numbers between point and mark can be summed by entering: <kbd>C-x * :</kbd>

The sum appears in Emacs Calc's buffer at the top of its stack.

To copy the sum back to the original buffer, press <kbd>y</kbd>.

To sum a row of numbers instead, use <kbd>C-x * _</kbd>
