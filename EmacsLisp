Emacs Lisp, or Elisp (see EmacsLispLegalName), is a variant of MacLisp that much of Emacs is written in, as
well as being the extension language that customizations and extensions are written in.

Emacs Lisp is what makes Emacs ExtensibleSoftware. Customizations and
extensions can be made quickly and portably. Some of the ways that
Emacs Lisp is used to extend Emacs include hooking custom Emacs Lisp
functions into events, binding functions to key combinations, 
creating new editing modes and even writing whole applications for the WorldWideWeb or other Internet clients.

Lisp has been rumored to stand for Lots of Insignificant Silly
Parentheses, but it really means '''LIS'''t '''P'''rocessor.

To read about other kinds of Lisp and how to use them in conjunction
with Emacs, see CommonLisp and [[Scheme]].

EmacsLispReference is the official documentation.

EmacsLispIntro is a book for non-programmers available from the FreeSoftwareFoundation and is shipped with Emacs.

For help on using other people's Emacs Lisp, see InstallingPackages.
