==About Me==

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Søren Lund, and I've been an Emacs user since the early nineties (around version 18 dot something).

I've always used the GnuEmacs version—never [[XEmacs]] or other variants (besides NTEmacs back in the day, when an official build did not exist for Windows and I had to use Windows for whatever reason).

==How I Install and Configure Emacs==

On Linux, I prefer to build Emacs myself, as I want the latest release and the packaged versions are usually behind. To automate building, I've written a Bash script:

* https://codeberg.org/slu/my-dev-utils/src/branch/main/bin/slu-install-emacs.sh

The script should work equally well on Debian and Ubuntu.

On Windows, I download the zipped binaries, e.g., [tt]emacs-30.2.zip[/tt], from https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html—and then I

# unzip that into [tt]C:\Users\<username>\opt\emacs-30.2[/tt]
# create a junction (from a Command Prompt): [tt]mklink /j C:\Users\<username>\opt\emacs C:\Users\<username>\opt\emacs-30.2[/tt]
# run [tt]C:\Users\<username>\opt\emacs\bin\addpm.exe[/tt]

In either case, I keep my Emacs configuration in Git. You can find it here: https://codeberg.org/slu/dot-emacs

==My Emacs Contributions==

I've contributed with a Danish CalendarLocalization, that also adds Danish holidays.

I've written about integrating CfnLint into Emacs.

I've written [https://github.com/soren/App-TimeClock timeclock.pl]—a TimeClock reporting utility
