==About Me==

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Søren Lund, and I've been an Emacs user since the early nineties (around version 18 dot something).

I've always used the GNU/Emacs version, never XEmacs or other variants (besides the NTEmacs when I've had to use Windows).


==My Dot Emacs File==

You can find my Emacs configuration here: https://codeberg.org/slu/dot-emacs


==My Emacs Contributions==

I've contributed with Danish CalendarLocalization, that also adds Danish holidays.

I've written about integrating CfnLint into Emacs.
