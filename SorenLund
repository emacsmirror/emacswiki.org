==About Me==

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Søren Lund, and I've been an Emacs user since the early nineties (around version 18 dot something).

I've always used the GnuEmacs version, never [[XEmacs]] or other variants (besides NTEmacs back in the day when not official build existed for Windows and I had to use Windows for whatever reason).


==My Dot Emacs File==

You can find my Emacs configuration here: https://codeberg.org/slu/dot-emacs


==My Emacs Contributions==

I've contributed with a Danish CalendarLocalization, that also adds Danish holidays.

I've written about integrating CfnLint into Emacs.

I've written [https://github.com/soren/App-TimeClock timeclock.pl] - a TimeClock reporting utility
