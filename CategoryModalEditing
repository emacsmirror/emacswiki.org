This page describes support for modal editing in Emacs, 

Modal editing is a style of text-editing with different modes of operation, each with a different set of commands that can be used. For example Vim has an "insert mode" for inserting text and a "normal mode" for navigation, searching, and other operations.

Emacs in its default configuration is generally considered to be a modeless editor.
