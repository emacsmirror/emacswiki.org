Is it possible to set the current directory for Emacs? After
closing "all" buffers, `C-x C-f' reverts to the home directory.

The easy answer is `M-x cd'.
But usually I just try to start Emacs in whatever I want the
default directory to be.

Basically the way it works is that you cannot ever close "all"
your buffers. The last buffer will have a current directory, and
when you use `C-x C-f' there, that's what you'll get. `M-x cd' will
just change /that/ buffer's default directory.

If you then close all buffers and end up with a /different/ last
buffer, then you'll get that buffer's default directory. So I'm
not sure that `M-x cd' is what you really need. I find it hardly
ever helps.

You just need to make sure that almost all buffers (including
those most likely to be your "last" buffers such as ##*scratch*## or
##*Messages*##) get created with the right default directory. And
that means making sure you start Emacs in the correct
directory.

(The value of [[variable]] `default-directory' is the default (aka current) directory.)
