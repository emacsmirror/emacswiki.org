The rest of this page contains interesting conversations from EmacsMailingLists about releasing Emacs 21.

An excerpt from Irving Stone's ''Agony and the Ecstasy.''

''During all these months the Pope kept insisting that Michelangelo complete his ceiling quickly, quickly! Then one day [Pope] Julius climbed the ladder unannounced.

'' 'When will it be finished?'

'' 'When I have satisfied myself.'

'' 'Satisfied yourself in what? You have already taken four full years.'

'' 'In the matter of art, Holy Father.'

'' 'It is my pleasure that you finish it in a matter of days.'

'' 'It will be done, Holy Father, when it will be done.' ''

We've had different answers, too, however.
It all started with a mail by Thaddeus L. Olczyk in summer 01 [http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=29&as_minm=3&as_miny=1995&as_maxd=13&as_maxm=7&as_maxy=2001&selm=3b4e80f0.620366593%40nntp.interaccess.com]:

People are once again asking about Emacs 21,
and it's been about four weeks since I asked this question.
So once again I ask this question to stall all the posters that
will soon come asking.

: Will Emacs 21 be released:
: Immenently (next 2-3 weeks)?
: soon ( 2-3 months)?
: not so soon (6 months to a year)?
: a long time off ( one year to five years)?
: almost never (10 years)?

[...]

It's not that we know the date but don't want to tell.  We really don't
know.  As long as there are reports about crashes on popular platforms, we
won't release.  And just the other day I saw two crash reports, after at
least 2-3 weeks without a single one.

: So will Emacs 21 be released:
: Immenently (next 2-3 weeks)?

Hopefully.

: soon ( 2-3 months)?

Most probably.

: not so soon (6 months to a year)?

Unlikely.

: a long time off (one year to five years)?
: almost never (10 years)?

Inconceivable.

First column is prerelease number, second one is the number of days
between the prerelease and the previous one.

Discounting the one-digit rows as quick corrections of small
oversights, it is easy to see that things seems to be converging
towards stabilization.

(BTW, I'm *not* speaking for the Emacs maintainters, which I am not).

: OK. This would seem to be bad news. It means we have to wait at least
  66 days after 104 was released before we can be sure that there won't
  be a 105.

  pretest 21.0.N, we need to wait N^Pi days, and if there no crashes or
  other similarly grave problems reported, only then we can make a release.

And what exactly are you going to _do_ about that, huh?  Switch to XEmacs,
perhaps??

      ToDate[FromDate[{2001,7,13,0,0,0}] + Floor[N[104^Pi]] 3600 24])

: Emacs' calendar package couldn't handle this:

</pre>

I think your calculations are wrong (3000 years is much closer to the
accurate result than 5944), and I didn't have any trouble adding that with
calendar (you just have to add days instead of years).  But if you think
something is wrong with calendar, please make a bug report.  E.g., "Emacs's
Calendar is unable to compute the date of its own final release".
