Some of [[ERC]]’s modules aren't part of GnuEmacs due to copyright assignment issues or because they depend on other packages that aren't a part of it.

* ErcBbdb
* ErcChess
* ErcList
* ErcNicklist
* ErcSpeak

If you use the version of ERC that comes with GnuEmacs you'll have to download the ##erc-5.x-extras## (replace ##x## with the number from your version of ERC) package from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/erc/ (or http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/erc/) or one of GNU's mirrors.
