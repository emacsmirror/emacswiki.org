Emacs can insert the current date and time in a file and keep it updated automatically.  See [[Manual:Time Stamps]].

Add the following Lisp to your InitFile.

  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)

By default, Emacs can update the time stamp for the following two
formats if *one* exists in the first 8 lines of the file.

   Time-stamp: <>
   Time-stamp: " "

The default `time-stamp-pattern' in Emacs is roughly this,

  "8/Time-stamp:[ \t]+\\\\?[\"<]+%:y-%02m-%02d %02H:%02M:%02S %u\\\\?[\">]"

The format starts with a number and then a slash.  This is the number
of lines to search from the beginning.  It can be negative for the
number of lines from the bottom of the file.  After the slash, a
regular expression will find the beginning of the time stamp in the
file, followeed by the time format string which you provide and is
based on the format more precisely described in GIT:time-stamp.el and
not the Lisp function `format-time-string'.  The pattern ends with
another regular expression.  It matches the end of the time stamp.

According to the documentation for this variable, it's important to
not change the default value for `time-stamp-pattern' globally.  It's
better to change it with FileLocalVariables.

For example, to maintain a time stamp for a string constant in the
third line of a C program, add this section of file local variables
found at the end of this C source file.

  #include <stdio.h>
  
  static char const *ts = "f.c 1993/11/09 17:40:15 eggert";
  
  int main()
  {
    return printf("%s\n", ts) == EOF;
  }
  
  /* Local Variables: */
  /* time-stamp-pattern: "4/static char const \\*ts = \"%f %:y/%02m/%02d %02H:%02M:%02S %u\";" */
  /* End: */

To add a time stamp to the end of an HTML file set the
`time-stamp-pattern' to search in the last eight lines (-8) for a
paragraph element containing "Last modified".  Also, this inserts a
universal date with the `time-stamp-time-zone' variable.

     <p>Last modified: </p>
    </body>
  </html>
  <!-- Local Variables: -->
  <!-- time-stamp-pattern: "-8/<p>Last modified:[ \t]+%3a %3b %02H:%02M:%02S %Z %:y by %u</p>" -->
  <!-- time-stamp-time-zone: "UTC" -->
  <!-- End: -->

You might not want to pollute all your HTML files with the local
variables.  Using DirectoryVariables could help reduce the clutter, 
e.g., put the following in ##.dir-locals.el## to set the variables 
for all html-mode files under that directory:

    ((html-mode . ((time-stamp-pattern . "-8/<p>Last modified:[ \t]+%3a %3b %02H:%02M:%02S %Z %:y by %u</p>")
                   (time-stamp-time-zone . "UTC"))))

Alternatively, customize HtmlMode to affect all your HTML files with the
following hook.

    (add-hook 'html-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                (set (make-local-variable 'time-stamp-pattern)
                                     "-8/<p>Last modified:[ \t]+%3a %3b %02H:%02M:%02S %Z %:y by %u</p>")
                                (set (make-local-variable 'time-stamp-time-zone) "UTC")))

* Library <tt>[[header2.el]]</tt> has code to insert and update a date and time field in a file header. Unlike vanilla Emacs time stamps, such a time stamp need not be within the first eight lines of the file. The default time stamp format used by ##header2.el## looks like this, but you can customize it any way you like (option `header-date-format'):

          Sun Dec 04 13:46:31 2005 (Pacific Standard Time)

* HtmlHelperMode also supports time-stamps.
* VersionControl backends have keyword subtitution which supports inserting time-stamps.
