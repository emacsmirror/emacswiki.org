Hi, I am an academic computer scientist and started to use Emacs as a teenager in 2014.

== Work ==

I maintain a few packages that are on GNU ELPA.  Of these, [[CompatLibrary]] is the most successful one I comaintain with DanielMendler.

In the Emacs project I mostly work on PackageEl and GnuELPA.  I have the self-assigned job of reviewing incoming packages, providing feedback and trying to contextualize the submissions.  Besides this I have occasional contributions all over the place, fixing up minor annoyances or trying to polish features.

On EmacsWiki I have started the EmacsThirtyHighlights and EmacsThirtyOneHighlights pages.

== Opinions ==

(I preface this with the assurance of my apologies for a inclination to theatrics.) 

* Emacs should be usable OOTB without having to install hundreds of packages.
* Emacs being usable doesn't mean that it should mimick other programs UI and UX.
* Emacs virtues lie in a consistent abstraction (rich text) and a simple, low-barrier extensibility (Lisp).
* Emacs is both a program and the totality of users.  A re-implementation that breaks with the latter, peruses the former in vain.
* Discussions on appearance are mostly a distraction.  The main advantage of the current look and feel is that it scares away people without taste.
* Most attempts to brush up the appearance of Emacs are doomed to indulge in a design language that will feel outdated much faster than their designers anticipate.  Worse yet, in most cases is is already worn out, unbeknown to these innovators. 
* Systems like OrgMode or Magit, while neat, are a distraction.  For the most part, they are coincidentally implemented in Emacs and do not demonstrate any inherent advantages.
* GnuEmacs resembles a UnixShell more than a LispMachine.  Accepting that it is a part of a UnixSystem and utilizing the OS concurrency and tools is a fruitful exercise. 
* GnuEmacs is a transitory stage of a certain diaspora between universal, generalized computing or man's mechanized subjugation.   

== Links ==

I have a personal website: https://sdf.org/~pkal/ with some articles on Emacs and some Elisp scripts.

I am also on the Fediverse: https://social.sdfeu.org/@pkal, but I don't only post about Emacs.
