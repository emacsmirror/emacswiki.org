== IELM: Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode ==

A nice little mode that acts like an interactive Lisp interpreter.
It doesn't do all the fancy shell stuff such as redirection -- use the EmacsShell if you need that.  IELM is an alternative to Lisp Interactive mode, which is the mode of buffer `*scratch*'.

Start it using `M-x ielm'.  Then type `C-h m' as usual for more help.

It's real little [WikiPedia:Read-eval-print_loop read-eval-print loop] (REPL).

IELM is a ComintMode.

== Common customization ==

You can put this in your init file to enable eldoc mode by default:

    (defun my-ielm-mode-hook ()
      (turn-on-eldoc-mode))
    (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook (lambda () (run-hooks 'my-ielm-mode-hook)))

If you use ParEdit, and already have it installed, you can enable it in IELM automatically by using this instead:

    (defun my-ielm-mode-hook ()
      (turn-on-eldoc-mode)
      (and (featurep 'paredit) (paredit-mode 1)))

== Icicles Enhancements to IELM ==

You can use [[Icicles]] [[completion]] in IELM. Whenever there are multiple completion candidates, Icicles completion is used (if Icicle minor mode is on). This means you can [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]] to choose a candidate, complete using one or more substrings or [[regexp]]s ([[progressive completion]]), and so on. See [[Icicles - Completion in Other Buffers#ShellCommandCompletion|Icicles - Completion in Comint Modes]]. 

== Emacs as an `inferior-lisp-program` ==

You can use [https://web.archive.org/web/20160404232014/http://people.internetconnection.net/2009/06/emacs-as-an-inferior-lisp-program/ emacs itself as an inferior-lisp-program] (Archive.org link) which means you're still sending lisp forms to an external process.
