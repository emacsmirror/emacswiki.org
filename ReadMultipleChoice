<code>read-multiple-choice</code> is a natively compiled function built-in to Emacs.

It can be used as a lighter-weight alternative to menu-driven packages like [[Transient]] or [[Hydra]], for when a simple selection menu with several options and a single input is desired.

           (setq completion-styles (read sentry))))
