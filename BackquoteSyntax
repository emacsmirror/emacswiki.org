Often when setting variables (particularly [AssociationList Alists]) or when [MacroBasics writing macros], you need to quote
most, but not all of a list.

When this is the case, <code>quote</code> is too "greedy", it quotes
_everything_ with no option of unquoting bits.  You can use
<code>list</code> instead of quote, and then individually quote the
bits of the list that you don't want evaluated.  So you might write:

    (list 'foo bar 'baz)

To produce a list where <code>foo</code> and <code>baz</code> are
returned literally, but <code>bar</code> is evaluated.

This is where the backquote "<code>`</code>" comes in.  It quotes all
of a form, except for those bits which you decide you want
evaluated.  You can introduce evaluation with a comma
"<code>,</code>".  So, instead of writing the above form, you might
write:

    `(foo ,bar baz)

Which produces the same effect.  In fact, the backquote is a
reader-macro, i.e. it introduces the beginning of a form which gets
macroexpanded (into the list-like syntax), we can see this with:

    (macroexpand '`("%b - " ,(getenv "USERNAME") "@" ,(getenv "USERDOMAIN")))
        => (list "%b - " (getenv "USERNAME") "@" (getenv "USERDOMAIN"))

(This from FrameTitle).

Backquotes are also useful when writing macros.  Since, when using
them, you can write your macro such that it looks very similar to a
defun.  Compare:

    (defmacro my-macro-1 (arg1 arg2)
      (list 'setq arg1 (list 'cons arg2 arg1)))

and

    (defmacro my-macro-2 (arg1 arg2)
      `(setq ,arg1 ,`(cons ,arg2 ,arg1)))

Comparing the macroexpansions:

    (macroexpand '(my-macro-1 list 'foo))
        => (setq list (cons 'foo list))

    (macroexpand '(my-macro-2 list 'foo))
        => (setq list (cons 'foo list))

Another backquote-specific operator is the comma-at
"<code>,@</code>", which acts as a "splicing" operator.  This is best
demonstrated with an example:

    (let ((list '(a b c d)))
      `(elt1 ,list elt2))
        => (elt1 (a b c d) elt2)

Compared to:

    (let ((list '(a b c d)))
      `(elt1 ,@list elt2))
        => (elt1 a b c d elt2)

This is particularly useful when writing macros with an
<code>&rest</code> specifier.

Very informative section, thanks! -- GlauberPrado


Short but sweet - the prefect intro to backquotes! Thanks! -- [[halloleo]]
