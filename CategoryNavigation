Navigating through the text of large buffers, or multiple buffers, especially code.

== General Navigation Facilities Included with Emacs ==

* BookMarks -- Record locations so you can return to them later.
* MarkCommands -- Common commands for manipulating and using the [[mark]].
* GrepMode -- Search via external "grep" utility.
* OccurMode -- List all lines of the current buffer that match a regexp.
* CompilationMode -- Navigate based on the output of compilers or any other utility that gives the line numbers.
* ImenuMode -- Move quickly among definitions of functions, macros, classes, types, whatever.
* WhichFuncMode -- Displays the current function name in the mode line.
* [http://cedet.sourceforge.net CEDET] -- An advanced development environment in Emacs.

== Navigation by Tags ==

* Emacs tags -- Record and locate identifier definitions in source files based on a [[tags file]].
** Overview: EmacsTags (etags)
** Building tags files
*** BuildTags -- How to create them.
*** ExuberantCtags (ctags) -- Support for more languages and editors than etags.
** Navigating to tags (definitions)
*** [[Icicles - Emacs Tags Enhancements]] -- Find or browse tags from all tags files (including multiple matches for a tag).
*** EtagsSelect -- Select from multiple matches to a tag.
*** EctagsSelect -- Etags replacement that uses ExuberantCtags and eldoc.
*** EtagsStack -- Navigate the tags stack.
*** EtagsTable -- Set the tags-table-list based on the current file.
* GnuGlobal -- Database of code identifiers and tags.
* OpenGrok -- Database of symbols and references

== Navigation By Hyperlink ==

* EevMode -- EmacsLisp hyperlinks that help navigate source code.
* LinkdMode -- Embed hyperlinks in all kinds of text files
* WikiNavMode -- Navigate text files via &#91;&#91;wiki-style&#93;&#93; double-bracketed links

== Other Navigation Libraries ==

* VisibleBookmarks -- Visible buffer-local bookmarks and the ability to jump between them.
* [[EAssist]] -- find a function name by typing only part of it
* GonzuiForEmacs -- Emacs interface of `gonzui', a source code search engine.
* BackButton -- an alternative method for navigation by analogy with the “back” button in a web browser
* FixmeeMode -- Quickly navigate to FIXME notices in code.
* FixmeMode -- Highlighting FIXME, TODO, BUG, and other warning comments, and jumping to these tags
* IdeBridge -- Code completion, refactoring, and compilation for C# (only available on win32 now).
* IdUtils -- Database of code identifiers.
* [[Icicles - Other Search Commands#IciclesImenu|Icicles Imenu]] -- Imenu with [[regexp]] [[completion]]. Like EmacsTags, works across multiple buffers, files, and saved regions.
* SimpleCallTree -- A call-tree data structure that says which function calls which function. Highlights functions.
* Lisp:simple-call-tree+.el -- major mode for displaying and navigating simple call tree
* XreFactory -- Code completion, source browsing, and code refactoring.
* SrSpeedbar -- Displays information about the current buffer, allowing you to better navigate your sources.
* CScopeAndEmacs -- Look up where a symbol is defined, called, and so on.
* ToggleTest -- Quickly toggle between Test files and Test Subject (Source) files
* Tree: Multi-directory find, grep, tags generation

== Extension Libraries ==

These navigation utility libraries are useful from Emacs Lisp, but do not have user-facing interfaces.

* NavFlash -- Temporarily highlight the line containing the point.

* CategoryProgrammerUtils
* CategoryBookmarking
