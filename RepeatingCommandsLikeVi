=== DotMode ===

Emacs' `repeat' command (`C-x z') only repeats the last command, DotMode is a better emulation of vi's `.' command as it actually tries to repeat the last buffer change.

=== EmacsFaq ===

As seen in the EmacsFaq:

: '''Is there an equivalent to the `.' (dot) command of vi?'''

: ''(`.' is the redo command in `vi'.  It redoes the last insertion/deletion.)''

: ''As of Emacs 20.3, there is indeed a `repeat' command (`C-x z') that repeats the last command.  If you preface it with a prefix argument, the prefix arg is applied to the command.''

: ''You can also type `<tt>C-x <ESC> <ESC></tt>' (`repeat-complex-command') to reinvoke commands that used the minibuffer to get arguments.  In `repeat-complex-command' you can type `M-p' and `M-n' (and also up-arrow and down-arrow, if your keyboard has these keys) to scan through all the different complex commands you've typed.''

: ''To repeat a set of commands, use keyboard macros.  (See KeyboardMacros)''

: ''If you're really desperate for the `.' command, use VIPER, a `vi' emulation mode which comes with Emacs, and which appears to support it.  (See ViperMode)''
