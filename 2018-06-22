Sometimes people try to download the entire site, not realising that is is hosted on a tiny VM together with all my private stuff. And then I get stuff like this in my logs:

This is the result:

And then of course my monitoring services decided to shut the site down.

Whoever you are, whenever you are thinking about downloading thousands of pages, please start reading WikiDownload.

The link is one of the first links of the SiteMap. It leads you to the [[Git repository]]. What else would you want?

This is the repo you want:

{{{
https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org.git
}}}

Or follow the link to the [[Rsync repository]].

This is the command you want:

{{{
rsync -avz --no-perms theshire.emacs.cl::emacswiki emacswiki
}}}

Please don't treat every website like it's a run by a big company using cloud-something-something to cache and distribute and whatever. Think of the good old days when we thought the Internet was going to be distributed and everybody would be connected, directly, with small machines and tiny cables.
