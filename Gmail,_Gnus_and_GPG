AlexSchroeder wrote [https://github.com/kensanata/ggg a short tutorial on how to setup Gnus to send and receive encryped mail via Gmail] and hosted it on !GitHub. Here's a copy! :)

= Gmail Gnus GPG Guide (GGGG) =

This page is about sending and receiving encrypted mail using
[https://mail.google.com/ Gmail], [http://www.gnus.org/ Gnus] and
[https://www.gnupg.org/ GPG]. If you're just interested in sending
and receiving encrypted mail, you should probably see [https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/ Email Self-Defense] by the [https://www.fsf.org/ Free Software Foundation].

I'm assuming you know a bit about all the tools involved: *Gmail* is
Google's email service. *Gnus* is a mail and news reader that comes
with [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs]. *GPG* is actually
GnuPG, a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as
defined by [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt RFC4880] (also known
as PGP). My problem has always been putting it all together. Hopefully
this page will help you do just that.

We're going to use Gmail to send and receive encrypted mail. Google is
doing a good job defending us against criminals. This setup will not
prevent network analysis from criminal investigators and US spying
agencies. People will be able to reconstruct who you're communicating
with because the email senders and recipients are never hidden. This
setup will also not prevent you and your partners from making mistakes
such as leaving unencrypted emails lying on their computers. And finally,
this setup will also not help you if your computer has been taken over
by a government
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29 Trojan]
(malware such as
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging keystroke loggers] or
screen loggers). But,
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29 defense in depth]
is important. Every little thing helps. And it definitely makes mass
surveillance much harder and more expensive to do.

== Getting a secret key for GPG =

We'll generate a new secret key using GPG. A secret key is like your
identity. You need to keep it safe. Every secret key comes with a public
key. This is what other people will need to send you email. You'll have
to get it to them somehow. In return you will get the public keys of
your partners. Both secret and public keys are stored in keyrings in
your home directory.

Here's what an initial run of gpg looks like:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg --list-keys
gpg: directory `/Users/Guest/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: /Users/Guest/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
}}}

For this example, I did not change any settings in my ##gpg.conf##. If
you're interested in learning more, you might want to read
[https://gist.github.com/bnagy/8914f712f689cc01c267 GPG / Mutt / Gmail]
by Ben Nagy.

Let's create our secret key using ##gpg --gen-key##.

Here's what you want to answer:

# we want the default kind of key (option 1: RSA and RSA)
# we want the largest size (4096 bits)
# we want the key to be valid for one year (1y)
# we'll provide our name and our email address to identify the key
# we'll provide a passphrase

A /passphrase/ is like a very long password. Use a good one and don't
forget it. All your other passwords will end up being protected by
this one passphrase.

Here's what the entire process will look like:

{{{

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

The first hex number is your Key ID. In this case that would be
##7893C0FD##. You'll need to remember that.

I like to expire my keys. This simplifies things because I don't have to
worry about revocation certificates and all that. If you do, you could
learn more by reading

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
}}}

They would save this block in a file such as ##alex.pub## and import it.
Here, I got a public key from a friend called "oliof" and imported it.

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg --import oliof.pub
gpg: key 5F871B02: public key "keybase.io/oliof <oliof@keybase.io>" imported

gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
}}}

If you meet your partners face to face, giving them a copy of your
public key is easy. If you never met, it's harder. How do you make sure
that criminals didn't interfere? This is called a
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack man-in-the-middle attack].
You could make it harder by publishing your fingerprint on various
channels. Attackers would have to replace these fingerprints everywhere.
It's not perfect, but it's much better than nothing.

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg --fingerprint kensanata@gmail.com
pub   4096R/7893C0FD 2015-07-24 [expires: 2016-07-23]

}}}

The fingerprint is right here: `1A38 75FD 21ED 85BE 5AC6 BF49 5C1A C924
7893 C0FD`. Put it on your web page, in your email signatures, tweet it,
and so on. Consider using [https://keybase.io/ Keybase]. It allows you
to "Get a public key, safely, starting just with someone's social media
username(s)."

== Getting a password for Gmail =

This setup assumes that you have
[https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ enabled 2-step authentication]
for your Gmail account. If you haven't done that, you should do that
first.

Now, you'll need to
[https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords get an app password for your Gmail account].
Visit the link and generate a new one. Where it says "Select app" pick
"Other" and answer "Emacs". Where it say "Select device" answer "laptop"
or whatever. These two are just used to generate a good looking name in
the list above. This app password allows an app to access your Gmail
account even though you enabled 2-step authentication. The benefit is
that you can disable this password and generate a new one once you learn
that somebody may have stolen it.

Let's assume that the password generated is "thisismysecretpw".

== Storing your Gmail password for Gnus, using GPG to encrypt it =

We want Gnus to know about this password. Gnus uses a file called
##~./authinfo.gpg## for all your passwords. This file will be protected by
the passphrase for your GPG key!

Edit the file:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ emacs ~/.authinfo.gpg
}}}

This is the content of your new file. Make sure to /change email address
and password!*

{{{
machine imap.gmail.com login kensanata@gmail.com password thisismysecretpw port 993
machine smtp.gmail.com login kensanata@gmail.com password thisismysecretpw port 587
}}}

When you save the file, Emacs will ask you about the recipients:

{{{
Select recipients for encryption.
If no one is selected, symmetric encryption will be performed.
- `m' to mark a key on the line
- `u' to unmark a key on the line
[Cancel][OK]

  u 5C1AC9247893C0FD Alex Schroeder <kensanata@gmail.com>
  - FF13FA295F871B02 keybase.io/oliof <oliof@keybase.io>
}}}

Move the line marked with the ##u##. This is the key with "ultimate trust"
-- your own. Hit ##m## and tab to the ##[OK]## button, hit Enter.

If you exit Emacs and try to open the file again, you'll be asked for
your passphrase. Excellent!

== Setting up Gnus for Gmail =

Gnus is a powerful tool. Originally, it was intended to read news on
USENET. Then backends were added and now it can read RSS files, mail in
various formats, and more. We'll use it to access Gmail via IMAP and to
send mail via SMTP.

When sending your first email from Gnus, you might get a STARTTLS error.
If you’re using [http://brew.sh/ Homebrew] in Mac OS X, you can install
the necessary package with ##brew install gnutls##.

We'll keep our settings in a separate ##~/.gnus## file. Gnus will read
this file when it starts.

{{{

}}}

== Run Gnus =

Do it now! Start Emacs and run ##M-x gnus##. You will be prompted for your
passphrase to unlock the Gmail password, and then Gnus will start
running. You should see something like the following:

{{{
       1: INBOX
      22: [Gmail]/All Mail
     984: [Gmail]/Spam
     174: [Gmail]/Trash
    7806: [Gmail]/Chats
      19: [Gmail]/Important
*      0: [Gmail]/Starred
}}}

== Send encrypted mail =

Let's test sending some encrypted mail. Hit ##m## to create a message
buffer. The tag ##<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>## makes sure that
Emacs will encrypt the mail before sending it.

{{{

Subject: Testing Gnus Setup

--text follows this line--
<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>
Hi Oliof

This is a test for my tutorial.

Cheers
Alex
}}}

The message log in the echo area should says something like the following:

{{{
Sending via mail...
Opening STARTTLS connection to `smtp.gmail.com:587'...done
Sending email
Sending email done
Sending...done
}}}

Done!

If you go back to your ##*Group*## buffer, you might want to verify that
the email got sent. Use ##3 L## to display all the groups at level three,
even if they are empty. You should see a group called ##[Gmail]/Sent Mail##.
Enter it, and move to the end. You should see the mail you just wrote:

{{{
O. [   ?: -> oliof@keybase.io    ] Testing Gnus Setup
}}}

When you enter it, Gnus will ask you: ##Decrypt (PGP) part? (y or n)##.
If you answer correctly, you will see the email you sent. Maybe you'll
have to provide your passphrase again. The only reason you can read
this email is because it was encrypted both for the mail recipient
(oliof) and your own key (because of the ##mml2015-signers## setting).

Here you go:

== Troubleshooting =

If you installed Emacs for Windows and you're reading an email message
containing HTML, Gnus will try to render it for you. This uses the
libxml2 library which doesn't come with the default installation.
You'll see an empty mail body and Emacs will show "libxml2 library not
found" in the echo area. This is sad but what are you going to do?
Install ##libxml2##, of course!

The [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/README Emacs README] tells
you to install it from Eli Zaretskii's collection [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ on SourceForge]. The
important part is that the files in its ##bin## directory are on your
##PATH##.

== Keyservers =

You can install support for keyservers. Modify your ##~/.gnupg/gpg.conf##
and add the following two lines:

{{{
keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver-options ca-cert-file=~/.gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
}}}

I'm also going to "trust" them all, so I've changed this setting:

{{{
= More like "Web of Mistrust", amirite?? =
trust-model always
}}}

You need to download the [https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem PEM] file [https://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php#pool_hkps from their site] and save it in your ##~/.gnupg## directory.
Then download their [https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem.asc signature].
Verify it!

(If you're on a Mac with ##curl## and without ##wget##, use ##curl --remote-name URL## instead of ##wget URL##.)

Now we can do a little test with a bot!

Export your public key as explained above and paste it into an email
to ##edward-en@fsf.org## with a subject such as "hello bot". This first
email is not going to be encrypted. That's why you need to /delete/
the ##<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>## tag. This time only,
promised!

You'll get back a reply:

{{{

I received your public key. Thanks.

Next, retrieve his public key from the keyserver. That's why we needed
the keyserver: to get keys of strangers.

And now we can send him an email, signed and encrypted. This time we
won't be removing the ##<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>## tag!

We should get back another reply:

{{{
I received your message and decrypted it.

Your signature was verified.

Yay!

== The GPG Agent and Emacs =

The GPG Agent is a service that will remember your passphrase for a
short while. If you don't use it, Gnus will ask you for your
passphrase for every backend it uses (because it needs to decrypt the
##~/.authinfo.gpg## file) and for every encrypted mail you read and for
every encrypted mail you send. You'll be typing your passphrase a lot.

For this to work we need three pieces:

# we want to start the gpg-agent as soon as possible; it should write
   its contact information into an environment file

# we want to contact an existing gpg-agent from the shell using this
   environment file

# we want to contact an existing gpg-agent from Emacs using this
   environment file

I also find that sometimes the agent doesn't work as expected. Perhaps
the agent died after a while, or Emacs was started before the agent
was launched, whatever. I need some functions to help me out.

Here's some code for your Emacs init file. It reads the environment
file, checks whether the gpg-agent still exists, and if it does not,
it tries to kill any unresponsive instances of the gpg-agent and
starts a new one, writing a new environment file, and then it reads
this environment file.

{{{
(defun gpg-agent-restart ()
  "This kills and restarts the gpg-agent.

To kill gpg-agent, we use killall. If you know that the agent is
OK, you should just reload the environment file using
`gpg-agent-reload-info'."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command "killall gpg-agent")
  (shell-command "gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --write-env-file")
  ;; read the environment file instead of parsing the output
  (gpg-agent-reload-info))

(defun gpg-agent-reload-info ()
  "Reload the ~/.gpg-agent-info file."
  (interactive)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file (expand-file-name "~/.gpg-agent-info"))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward "\\([A-Z_]+\\)=\\(.*\\)" nil t)
      (setenv (match-string 1) (match-string 2)))))

(defun gpg-agent-startup ()
  "Initialize the gpg-agent if necessary.

Note that sometimes the gpg-agent can be up and running and still
be useless, in which case you should restart it using
`gpg-agent-restart'."
  (gpg-agent-reload-info)
  (unless (member (string-to-number (getenv "SSH_AGENT_PID"))
                  (list-system-processes))
    (gpg-agent-restart)))

(gpg-agent-startup)
}}}

Sometimes setup instructions will tell you how to start the gpg-agent
for a shell. The contact information is stored in environment
variables which are exported to child processes. This works if you
stick to a single terminal. All the processes you start inherit the
environment and thus they can all contact the gpg-agent you started.
However, if Emacs is started by a window manager, it does not inherit
the environment from a shell. That's why we're using an environment
file.

== The GPG Agent and the Shell =

If you want to use GPG from the shell, we repeat the same process
using a shell script.

Hopefully the gpg-agent was started for you by the operating system.
This is what you hope to see:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: gpg-agent running and available
}}}

If you just installed gpg-agent and it's not active, this is what you'll see:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: no gpg-agent running in this session
}}}

Here's what you should put in your ##~/.bashrc## file (this is
[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html#Bash-Startup-Files read by interactive non-login shells]
and usually ##~/.bash_profile## sources it as well).

{{{
= GPG =
function gpg-agent-restart {
    killall gpg-agent
    gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --write-env-file
    gpg-agent-reload-info
}

function gpg-agent-reload-info {
    source ~/.gpg-agent-info
    export GPG_AGENT_INFO
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    export SSH_AGENT_PID
}

function gpg-agent-restart {
    if test -f ~/.gpg-agent-info && \
            kill -0 ##grep GPG_AGENT_INFO $HOME/.gpg-agent-info | cut -d: -f2## 2>/dev/null; then
        gpg-agent-reload-info
    else
        eval ##gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file##
    fi
}

gpg-agent-restart
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
}}}

Hopefully everything is working as intended, now.

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: gpg-agent running and available
}}}

== Using Homebrew to Install GPG =

Using [http://brew.sh/ Homebrew]:

{{{
brew install gpg2
brew install gpg-agent
brew install pinentry-mac
}}}

Installing ##gpg-agent## tells you to make sure you use
##use-standard-socket## in your ##~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf##. This appears
not to be necessary, however.

=== Starting the GPG Agent as a Service on a Mac =

If you need the gpg-agent to be available to other applications aside
from Emacs and the shell, you might want to have it launched when you
log in.

Note: If you only use GPG from the shell and within Emacs, you don't
need to this. Skip this section.

First, let's verify that the gpg-agent doesn't run:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg-agent
-bash: gpg-agent: command not found
}}}

Create the file ##~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.gnupg.gpg-agent.plist##
with the following content. Make sure you change my username ("Guest")
to something else!

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
   "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>org.gnupg.gpg-agent</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/Users/Guest/bin/start-gpg-agent.sh</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
}}}

Now create the shell script ##~/bin/startup-gpg-agent.sh## -- create the
##~/bin## directory if you need to. This shell script must be executable
(##chmod 700 ~/bin/startup-gpg-agent.sh##). It examines the default
environment file, and if it finds the file, it
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012527/what-does-kill-0-pid-in-a-shell-script-do checks whether the agent is usable].
If so, we use the file. If not, we start a new agent and tell it to
write an environment file.

{{{
= ${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info is the default filename =
if test -f $HOME/.gpg-agent-info && \
    kill -0 ##grep GPG_AGENT_INFO $HOME/.gpg-agent-info | cut -d: -f2## 2>/dev/null; then
    # do this in case we were called from the shell
    . "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"
    export GPG_AGENT_INFO
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    export SSH_AGENT_PID
else
    eval ##/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent --daemon --write-env-file##
fi
}}}

Log out and log back in to check whether you get the correct answer:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg-agent
gpg-agent: gpg-agent running and available
}}}

=== Pinentry on a Mac =

On a Mac, when decrypting a message using Emacs started from the GUI,
you'll see a simple, cut off message saying
`epa-file--find-file-not-found-function: Opening input file:
Decryption failed,`. Something is wrong!

If you only use Emacs within terminal windows, no problem. No need to
do anything. Skip this section!

We need to make sure that the agent uses *pinentry for a Mac*. This
is what I have in my ##~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf##.

{{{
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
enable-ssh-support
}}}

If you don't do that, the default ##pinentry## is linked to
##pinentry-curses## which will work in a terminal but it won't work in
Emacs!
