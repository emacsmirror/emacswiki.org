AlexSchroeder wrote a short tutorial on how to setup [[Gnus]] to send and receive encryped mail via Gmail and hosted it on !GitHub. It's called [https://github.com/kensanata/ggg Gmail Gnus GPG (GGG)]. Here's a copy!

Sending and receiving encrypted mail using
[https://mail.google.com/ Gmail], [http://www.gnus.org/ Gnus] and
[https://www.gnupg.org/ GPG]. I'm assuming you know a bit about all the
tools involved: Emacs, Gnus, Gmail, GPG. My problem has always been
putting it all together. Hopefully this file helps.

We're going to use Gmail to send and receive encrypted mail. Google is
doing a good job defending us against criminals. This setup will not
prevent network analysis from criminal investigators and US spying
agencies. People will be able to reconstruct who you're communicating
with because the email senders and recipients are never hidden. This
setup will also not prevent you and your partners from making mistakes
such as leaving unencrypted emails lying on your computers. And finally,
this setup will also not help you if your computer has been taken over
by a government
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29 Trojan]
(malware such as
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging keystroke loggers] or
screen loggers). But,
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29 defense in depth]
is important. Every little thing help. And it definitely makes mass
surveillance much harder and more expensive to do.

== Getting a secret key for GPG

We'll generate a new secret key using GPG. A secret key is like your
identity. You need to keep it safe. Every secret key comes with a public
key. This is what other people will need to send you email. You'll have
to get it to them somehow. In return you will get the public keys of
your partners. Both secret and public keys are stored in keyrings in
your home directory.

Here's what an initial run of gpg looks like:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg --list-keys
gpg: directory `/Users/Guest/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/Users/Guest/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: /Users/Guest/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
}}}

For this example, I did not change any settings in my ##gpg.conf##. If
you're interested in learning more, you might want to read
[https://gist.github.com/bnagy/8914f712f689cc01c267 GPG / Mutt / Gmail]
by Ben Nagy.

Let's create our secret key. It will ask us for a *passphrase*. Use a
good one and don't forget it. All your other passwords will end up being
protected by this one passphrase.

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

The first hex number is your Key ID. In this case that would be
##7893C0FD##. You'll need to remember that.

I like to expire my keys. This simplifies things because I don't have to
worry about revocation certificates and all that. If you do, you could
learn by reading

They would save this block in a file such as ##alex.pub## and import it.
Here, I got a public key from a friend called "oliof" and imported it.

{{{

gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
}}}

If you meet your partners face to face, giving them a copy of your
public key is easy. If you never met, it's harder. How do you make sure
that criminals didn't interfere? This is called a
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack man-in-the-middle attack].
You could make it harder by publishing your fingerprint on various
channels. Attackers would have to replace these fingerprints everywhere.
It's not perfect, but it's much better than nothing.

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ gpg --fingerprint kensanata@gmail.com
pub   4096R/7893C0FD 2015-07-24 [expires: 2016-07-23]

}}}

The fingerprint is right here: `1A38 75FD 21ED 85BE 5AC6 BF49 5C1A C924
7893 C0FD`. Put it on your web page, in your email signatures, tweet it,
and so on. Consider using [https://keybase.io/ Keybase]. It allows you
to "Get a public key, safely, starting just with someone's social media
username(s)."

== Getting a password for Gmail

This setup assumes that you have
[https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ enabled 2-step authentication]
for your Gmail account. If you haven't done that, you should do that
first.

Now, you'll need to
[https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords get an app password for your Gmail account].
Visit the link and generate a new one. Where it says "Select app" pick
"Other" and answer "Emacs". Where it say "Select device" answer "laptop"
or whatever. These two are just used to generate a good looking name in
the list above. This app password allows an app to access your Gmail
account even though you enabled 2-step authentication. The benefit is
that you can disable this password and generate a new one once you learn
that somebody may have stolen it.

Let's assume that the password generated is "thisismysecretpw".

== Storing your Gmail password for Gnus, using GPG to encrypt it

We want Gnus to know about this password. Gnus uses a file called
##~./authinfo.gpg## for all your passwords. This file will be protected by
the passphrase for your GPG key!

Edit the file:

{{{
Guest@Megabombus:~$ emacs ~/.authinfo.gpg
}}}

This is the content of your new file. Make sure to *change email address
and password*!

{{{
machine imap.gmail.com login example@gmail.com password thisismysecretpw port 993
machine smtp.gmail.com login example@gmail.com password thisismysecretpw port 587
}}}

When you save the file, Emacs will ask you about the recipients:

{{{
Select recipients for encryption.
If no one is selected, symmetric encryption will be performed.
- `m' to mark a key on the line
- `u' to unmark a key on the line
[Cancel][OK]

  u 5C1AC9247893C0FD Alex Schroeder <kensanata@gmail.com>
  - FF13FA295F871B02 keybase.io/oliof <oliof@keybase.io>
}}}

Move the line marked with the ##u##. This is the key with "ultimate trust"
-- your own. Hit ##m## and tab to the ##[OK]## button, hit Enter.

If you exit Emacs and try to open the file again, you'll be asked for
your passphrase. Excellent!

== Setting up Gnus for Gmail

Gnus is a powerful tool. Originally, it was intended to read news on
USENET. Then backends were added and now it can read RSS files, mail in
various formats, and more. We'll use it to access Gmail via IMAP and to
send Mail via SMTP.

When sending your first email from Gnus, you might get a STARTTLS error.
If you’re using [http://brew.sh/ Homebrew] in Mac OS X, you can install
the necessary package with ##brew install gnutls##.

We'll keep our settings in a separate ##~/.gnus## file. Gnus will read
this file when it starts.

{{{

  "Report the current or marked mails as spam.
This moves them into the Spam folder."
  (interactive)
  (gnus-summary-move-article nil "nnimap+imap.gmail.com:[Gmail]/Spam"))
}}}

== Run Gnus

Do it now! Start Emacs and run ##M-x gnus##. You will be prompted for your
passphrase to unlock the Gmail password, and then Gnus will start
running. You should see something like the following:

{{{
       1: INBOX
      22: [Gmail]/All Mail
     984: [Gmail]/Spam
     174: [Gmail]/Trash
    7806: [Gmail]/Chats
      19: [Gmail]/Important
*      0: [Gmail]/Starred
}}}

== Send encrypted mail

Let's test sending some encrypted mail. Hit ##m## to create a message
buffer. The tag ##<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>## makes sure that
Emacs will encrypt the mail before sending it.

{{{

Subject: Testing Gnus Setup
From: Guest User <kensanata@gmail.com>
--text follows this line--
<#secure method=pgpmime mode=encrypt>
Hi Oliof

This is	a test for my tutorial.

Cheers
Alex
}}}

The message log in the echo area should says something like the following:

{{{
Sending via mail...
Opening STARTTLS connection to `smtp.gmail.com:587'...done
Sending email
Sending email done
Sending...done
}}}

Done!

If you go back to your ##*Group*## buffer, you might want to verify that
the email got sent. Use ##3 L## to display all the groups at level three,
even if they are empty. You should see a group called ##[Gmail]/Sent Mail##.
Enter it, and move to the end. You should see the mail you just wrote:

{{{
O. [   ?: -> oliof@keybase.io    ] Testing Gnus Setup
}}}

When you enter it, Gnus will ask you: ##Decrypt (PGP) part? (y or n)##. If
you answer correctly, you will see the email you sent. Maybe you'll have
to provide your passphrase again. The only reason you can read this
email is because it was encrypted both for the mail recipient (olio) and
your own key (because of the ##mml2015-signers## setting).

Here you go:
