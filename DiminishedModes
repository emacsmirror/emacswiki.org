diminish.el[http://www.eskimo.com/~seldon/diminish.el] lets you fight modeline clutter by removing or abbreviating minor mode indicators.

    (require 'diminish)
    (eval-after-load "filladapt" '(diminish 'filladapt-mode))

The `eval-after-load' form lets you diminish modes not loaded at Emacs startup.

== Mode lines containing `:eval' forms ==

`diminished-modes' doesn't work on mode lines that use `:eval' (for example, [[Projectile]] uses it to display the current project)

Quick hack:

{{{
  (defun diminished-modes ()
    "Echo all active diminished or minor modes as if they were minor.
The display goes in the echo area; if it's too long even for that,
you can see the whole thing in the *Messages* buffer.
This doesn't change the status of any modes; it just lets you see
what diminished modes would be on the mode-line if they were still minor."
    (interactive)
    (let ((minor-modes minor-mode-alist)
          message)
      (while minor-modes
        (when (symbol-value (caar minor-modes))
          ;; This minor mode is active in this buffer
          (let* ((mode-pair (car minor-modes))
                 (mode (car mode-pair))
                 (minor-pair (or (assq mode diminished-mode-alist) mode-pair))
                 (minor-name (cadr minor-pair)))
            (when (symbolp minor-name)
              ;; This minor mode uses symbol indirection in the cdr
              (let ((symbols-seen (list minor-name)))
                (while (and (symbolp (callf symbol-value minor-name))
                            (not (memq minor-name symbols-seen)))
                  (push minor-name symbols-seen))))
            (push minor-name message)))
        (callf cdr minor-modes))
      ;; Handle :eval forms
      (setq message (mapconcat
                     (lambda (form)
                       (if (and (listp form) (eq (car form) :eval))
                           (apply 'eval (cdr form))
                         form))
                     (nreverse message) ""))
