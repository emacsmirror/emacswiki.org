Getting stuck?  Trying to figure something out?

== Built-in Help ==

* Use the Emacs help commands to find out more about what's going on.  If you are not familiar with them, use '''`##C-h C-h##`''' now, to learn.  
* HelpMenuBarPlus can help. It has a '''[[HelpMenuBarPlus#Whoops|Whoops!?]]''' submenu just for when you're stuck.

== Get Un-stuck == 

* Use '''`C-g'''' to basically cancel whatever command you're in.  
* Use `##C-]##' (`abort-recursive-edit') like a super-`C-g', and command '''`top-level'''' as well.
* In many uneditable buffers, such as ##* help## buffers, '''`q'''' often quits that buffer/window.

== Check your configuration ==

* If starting emacs with ##emacs -q## fixes the problem, the problem is probably due to something in your configuration. Check your InitFile.
* If ##emacs -q## has problems but ##emacs -Q## doesn't, it might be related to your Emacs distribution or your local setup.

== Search for help ==

* Search this wiki and other Emacs sites for tips, links, and recommendations.

== Ask for help ==

* Remember that Emacs has many options, and the defaults might not be what you expect.  
* You might get better help if you describe what you want and politely ask for suggestions instead of saying that Emacs is broken.

=== Where to ask for help ===

* You can post a message in the appropriate EmacsMailingLists or EmacsNewsgroups.
* The EmacsChannel can be good for real-time help if you can explain your problem concisely. If you need to share your config, use a service such as Gist or Pastebin.
* You can post technical questions on EmacsStackExchange (http://emacs.stackexchange.com). Remember to accept correct answers in order to recognize people's help and make it easy for other people to find the answers.
* You can pay for real-time help through services like https://www.codementor.io/emacs-experts

Feeling frustrated? Relax, and EnjoyWrestlingWithEmacs, knowing that others have gone through it and survived. ;-)
