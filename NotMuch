NotMuch is an email indexing and search tool based on Xapian. Like Gmail, Notmuch relies on tagging and fast searching to organize mail. By default, incoming mail is given the tags "UNREAD" and "INBOX." When the mail is archived and read, the two tags, respectively, are removed.

Notmuch comes bundled with an emacs mail client that relies on message-mode for composing mail.

For more information about Notmuch, see [[http://notmuchmail.org/|the official wiki]].

== NotMuch and Gnus ==
It is also possible to use NotMuch to index mail that is otherwise read in [[Gnus]]. See http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.user/13308 for more details.

suggests one way of setting up notmuch to work with [[Gnus]]. However,
the functions for going from a notmuch result to the message in gnus
needed some fiddling with on my end:

     (defun notmuch-file-to-group (file)
       "Calculate the Gnus group name from the given file name."
       (let ((group (file-name-directory (directory-file-name (file-name-directory file)))))
         (setq group (replace-regexp-in-string ".*/.Maildir/" "nnimap+local:" group))
         (setq group (replace-regexp-in-string "/$" "" group))
         (if (string-match ":$" group)
     	(concat group "INBOX")
           (replace-regexp-in-string ":\\." ":" group))
         ;; Seems like we don't even need this part:
         (setq group (replace-regexp-in-string "nnimap\\+local:\\.?" "" group))))

     (defun notmuch-goto-message-in-gnus ()
       "Open a summary buffer containing the current notmuch
     article."
       (interactive)
       (unless (gnus-alive-p) (with-temp-buffer (gnus)))
       (let ((group (notmuch-file-to-group (notmuch-show-get-filename)))
     	(message-id
     	 (replace-regexp-in-string "\"" ""
     	  (replace-regexp-in-string "^id:" ""
     				    (notmuch-show-get-message-id)))))
         (if (and group message-id)
     	(progn
     	  (gnus-summary-read-group group 1) ; have to show at least one old message
     	  (gnus-summary-refer-article message-id)) ; simpler than org-gnus method?
           (message "Couldn't get relevant infos for switching to Gnus."))))

     (define-key notmuch-show-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'notmuch-goto-message-in-gnus)
