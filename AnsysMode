= Ansys mode documentation =

Ansys mode provides support for the FEA (Finite Element Analysis)
program Ansys (http://www.ansys.com) under Computer systems where
Ansys and Gnu Emacs is running.  It defines 'Ansys mode', a major mode
for viewing, writing and navigating in APDL (Ansys Parametric Design
Language) files and provides managing and communication capabilities
for various Ansys solver processes as well.

The mode's capabilities are rather sophisticated but the documentation
is still targeted for Ansys users with little Emacs experience.  Any
suggestions for improvements are very welcome.  The latest development
version is available at http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/.

== Requirements ==

The code is based on Ansys version 12.0 and is written for the editor
GNU Emacs (not consciously targeted for XEmacs).  It is tested with
Emacs 23.1 under XP and GNU/Linux.  The code won't run without some
minor adaptions with Emacs 21.4.  Please visit
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/windows/ for an official, precompiled
Windows versions of GNU Emacs.  You might unpack Emacs in any
directory.  Optionally you can run the program addpm.exe (located in
the bin directory) to add an Emacs entry to the Windows Start menu
(please refer to the README.W32 file).

The Ansys solver control and communication capabilities are mainly
restricted to UNIX systems.

== Features ==

* Ansys process management (viewing error files, license status, etc.)

* Solver comunication facilities, i. e. sending code fragments from
  the macro file or commands interactively to an Ansys solver instance
  (UNIX only)

* Command syntax help in the editor (similar to but more verbose then
  the Ansys dynamic prompt) also with hints for undocumented commands

* Keyword completion of Ansys commands, elements, get- and
  parametric-functions (case-sensitive) of nearly 2000 symbols

* Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for code navigation: Skipping
  comments, navigating number blocks, searching *DO-, *IF-, *DOWHILE-,
  *CREATE-blocks, etc.

* Sophisticated highlighting in various decoration levels (complete
  Ansys keywords, undocumented commands, deprecated elements, ...)
  and optionally also user defined variables (experimental)

* Overview in a different window of all definitions (*GET, *DIM, *SET,
  =, *DO, ...) of APDL variables in the current file

* Preview and insertion (optionally auto-insertion) of header and
  Ansys code templates for APDL files.  Respective snippets represent
  examples of APDL work flows and considerable Ansys know-how and are
  easily extensible to boot

* Convenient comment handling, commenting out whole paragraphs or
  whole control blocks and vice versa

* Auto-indentation of looping blocks and conditional control blocks
  together with closing of open blocks with auto-insertion of the
  appropriate end keyword (case-sensitive)

* Outlining (hiding and navigating) of code sections with Emacs'
  outline-minor-mode

* Use of the Emacs abbreviation facility for block templates
  i. e. with writting a "nickname" Emacs exchanges the characters with
  a whole code template

== Installation ==

=== Short instructions ===

==== Direct way; no file configuration necessary ====

Important prerequisite: Emacs must know where all the code (.el) files
reside!  Extract the mode archive into an Emacs directory which is in
its default load-path (a good place is the "site-lisp" folder in your
Emacs installation tree) or indicate the directory with the
environment variable EMACSLOADPATH).

From there on you must load first the mode definitions with `M-x
load-file ansys-mode RET', i. e. typing "M-x" (first) the "Alt" key
and then the "x" key simultaneously, you'll end up in the so called
Emacs minibuffer prompt, now type "load-file" (you might apply the
"TAB" key for the Emacs auto-completion feature at every intermediate
stage 8-)) and conclude this input with the "RET" key. Emacs will then
prompt you for a file, write "ansys-mode.el" and press RET.
Thereafter call the mode function itself with `M-x ansys-mode RET' for
every interesting macro file.

==== More convenient way; file configuration necessary ====

Extract the files somewhere on disc and put the following paragraph
into your ".emacs" configuration file (in your home directory), adjust
the stuff in capital letters, restart Emacs and ansys-mode will be
automatically applied for all files with suffixes ".mac" and ".inp".

    (add-to-list 'load-path "C:\\DIRECTORY-PATH\\WHERE\\THE\\ANSYS-MODE\\FILES\\RESIDE")
      ;assuming you extracted the files on drive "c:"
      ;for example: "c:\\emacs\\emacs-23.1"
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mac\\'" . ansys-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.inp\\'" . ansys-mode))
    (autoload 'ansys-mode "ansys-mode" nil t)

=== Verbose instructions ===

* direct way, no configuration necessary (loading "by hand")

  Please consult the "direct way" description above.

  If you are unfamiliar by these concepts I suggest working through
  the build-in tutorial of GNU Emacs (you'll find it in the help entry
  in the menu bar), it doesn't take too much time and the investment
  will be worth it since it will accelerate your general editing
  capabilities in the future.

* permanent configuration

  When it becomes tiring of loading 'ansys-mode.el' every time you are
  starting a new Emacs session, you should specify the installation
  path for the mode files in your '~/.emacs' file (the configuration
  file '.emacs' of GNU Emacs in your home directory '~\').

     (add-to-list 'load-path
                  "C:\\YOUR\\DIRECTORY\\WHERE\\MODE\\FILES\\RECIDE")
     (autoload 'ansys-mode "ansys-mode" "Activate Ansys mode." 'interactive)

  From here you are able to type "M-x ansys-mode RET" to activate the
  mode for every interesting file.

* automatic mode assignment

  When you intend to apply the mode automatically, e. g. for all files
  you are opening with the extensions '.mac' and '.inp' ( .inp is the
  WorkBench default solver input file suffix), add the following to
  your '.emacs' file:

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mac$" . ansys-mode))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.inp$" . ansys-mode))

  The suffix below belongs to the "anys neutral file" export format
  which contains also an APDL header and footer.

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.anf$" . ansys-mode))

* An important customisation option is `ansys-highlighting-level'
  "fontification.mac" example TODO:

* Templates, code snippets, skeletons can extended "ansys-template.el"
  and be used similar to a macro library.

* autoinsertion of code

  In case you also want to enjoy the auto insertion feature, which
  puts (optionally) some predefined body of Ansys commands to every
  new APDL file insert the following into '.emacs':

     (setq auto-insert-mode 1)
     (setq auto-insert-query t) ;insert only after request
     (add-to-list 'auto-insert-alist '(ansys-mode . [ansys-skeleton-compilation]))

* autoloading of helper functions

  With below section you are also able to use certain Ansys related
  commands in a new Emacs session without the need of previously
  having explicitely called ansys-mode.

     (autoload 'ansys-customise-ansys "ansys-mode" "Activate the Ansys customisation buffer." 'interactive)
     (autoload 'ansys-abort-file "ansys-mode" "Activate Ansys abort file function." 'interactive)
     (autoload 'ansys-display-error-file "ansys-mode" "Activate Ansys display error file function." 'interactive)
     (autoload 'ansys-start-ansys-help "ansys-mode" "Activate Ansys start help function." 'interactive)
 TODO: -license-file, -license-program variables
     (autoload 'ansys-license-status "ansys-mode" "Activate Ansys license status function." 'interactive)


* further configuration methods

  As a summary and example to further customisation options please have
  a look at the accompanying "default.el" example, this applies
  specifically for the mode's solver communication capabilities.  The
  file could be used as as system wide startup file in the
  "EMACS_INSTALLDIR/site-lisp" directory and is therfore an
  alternative way to customisations in "~/.emacs", your personal
  configuration file.

== Usage ==

When you have a file under `ansys-mode' check out the menu bar's
"Ansys" entry for its possibilities and select the entry "Describe
Ansys Mode" or type "C-h m" (i. e. the CTRL key together with the "h"
key and subsequently the "m" key), which will display the Ansys mode
help which is the "online" guide for its usage 8-).

== Ansys mode customisation ==

For a summary and documentation of available Ansys mode customisations
it is best to open the mode customisation buffer either with the
command M-x `ansys-customise-ansys' or from the menu bar -> 'Ansys' ->
'Customise Ansys Mode'

When you are changing code in the mode (.el) files itself it is
sometimes necessary to unload and restart Ansys mode.  Instead of
restarting Emacs you can do this with the interactive command M-x
`ansys-restart-ansys-mode' or with the respective, toplevel Ansys menu
entry.

== History: ==

The version scheme is a mixture of the Ansys version (12.0) on which
some code is based and the version of the Ansys mode (1) itself.

=== Version 12.0.1 ===

* The lisp code had to be split up for better maintance, the code
  files for are now provided in an archive.

* Reworked the fontification mainly for the sake of speed.  There are
  now highlighting levels to choose from, offering e. g. higlighting
  of deprecated element types in a warning-face, deprecated Ansys *
  comments, ...

* The output from the LMUtil license status tool (C-c C-l) is now
  filtered.

* The `ansys-send-to-ansys' (C-c C-c) command is now generalised so
  that it also does some useful work without a running Ansys process
  (it copies the cursor line or the chosen region to the clipboard).

* Added tooltips to all Ansys menu entries.

* Added menu entry for reloading Ansys Mode for the case when certain
  customisation options in the code files itself are changed and
  require a code reloading to take effect.

=== Version 11.0.2 ===

* Enabled the preview of code templates or fragments (called
  skeletons in this mode, please inspect `ansys-display-skeleton').

* Removed "buffer has no process" bug when killing an ansys-mode
  buffer.

=== Version 11.0.1 ===

* Submitting interactively Ansys commands (via minibuffer query not
  only written in a macro file) to the solver process,
  ansys-query-ansys-command (C-c C-q).

=== ansys-mode.el version 11.0.1 in comparison to its predecessor ansys-mod.el: ===

* New: Provides Ansys command parameter- and syntax help.

* New: Offers Ansys process management: Acquiring license server
  information in a buffer Starting and stopping asynchronously
  Ansys runs.  Sending code lines to running Ansys process (sort of
  code debugging facility) and getting the output into a buffer.

* New: Experimental highlighting of user defined variables.
  Redefinition and clearing of variables is not yet taken into
  account.

* New: Emacs customisation facility is available for the new Ansys
  mode group.

* New: Emacs outline-minor-mode is readily available in conjunction
  with this mode.

* Completions of Ansys commands are now case-sensitive, with
  additional completion of function and element names.

* Previously defined skeletons are fully functional now, new ones
  are added and enabled with the abbreviation and auto-load
  facilities of Emacs 22.

* Ansys' interpreter's disregard of any capitalisation is now fully
  taken into account in the highlighting.

* The apostrophe "'" is now assigned as the Ansys string and the
  value of character parameters delimiter and not wrongly "''";
  the strings are fontified accordingly.

* The dollar sign "$" is now emphasised as the Ansys condensed
  input character (multiple Ansys commands in one line).

* The colon ":" is now emphasised as the Ansys colon do loop
  character ("(x:y:z)" means from x to y, in z steps, z is equal to
  one as default).  For example: "n,(1:6),(2:18:2)" runs 6 loops.
  Colon loops are working also with real values: k,,(2.5:3:0.1) and
  with array parameters: k,,A(1:100), but the latter is an
  undocumented feature. Since ansys 11.0 the colon looping is also
  working with *GET functions (example: A(1:5)=NX(1:5))). A ":"
  indicates also a beginning of a label for the *GO and *IF
  command.

* "%" is now distinguished as the Ansys parameter substitution
  and format specifier character.

* The ampersand "&" is now correctly highlighted as the only
  available Ansys continuation character applicable to the format
  commands (*MSG, *MWRITE, *VREAD and *VWRITE) command and the
  subsequent format strings of the command are fontified.

* New: " *" (SPC before *) is indicated as an (Ansys deprecated)
  comment sign e. g.: "a = 3 **4" results in "a" setting to 3,
  whereas "a = 3**4" sets "a" to 81!

* New: A line beginning with a comma is indented to the lenght of
  the last non slash or asterisk command as a reminder that the
  Ansys solver interprets this as a space holder for the last
  command keyword (the Ansys default command concept).

* Extended documentation, code cleaning and simplification of
  commands (e.g. comment handling) with the application of standard
  Emacs 22 facilities among other things.

== Minor Bugs and Problems ==

C*** does no parameter substitution, neither the /SYS command; this is
wrongly suggested in the variable highlighting of Ansys mode.

Comments behind the C*** are not possible and wrongly highlighted

A resetting of variables (VAR= ) is not taken into account

Ansys format line (multi-line) highlighting is somewhat brittle,
please use M-o M-o to update the fontification in case the format line
is not correctly highlighted.

The *END command is special: It needs 8 characters in all (+ 4
whitespaces to differentiate it from *ENDIF) before a comment
character behind it is accepted from the solver (please see the Ansys
12.0 manual), this is not yet indicated in ansys-mode.

=== Getting help ===

If you experience problems installing or running this mode you have
the following options:

* Write an email to the mode maintainer (you can trigger a bug report
  from the menu--at least a useful template when you are not in the
  position of sending emails within Emacs--or calling directly the
  function `ansys-submit-bug-report').

* When you have already a (cost free) Google account you are able
  to issue a bug report at the Google Code hosted page
  http://code.google.com/p/ansys-mode/issues/list.  From this site
  you can also download the latest development version.

* It might be helpful for you to visit the Emacs Wiki
  (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AnsysMode).  At the Wiki you
  can add some comments or wishes.
