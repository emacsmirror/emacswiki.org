This page describes package Lisp:switch-file.el, by ViniciusJoseLatorre.

: .:: ''v0.4'' ::.


== About switch-file ==

This package facilitates when you need to switch from a ##.cpp## file,
for example, to a corresponding ##.hpp## file.  That is, you visit a ##.cpp## file,
type ##M-x switch-cc-to-h RET##, and the corresponding ##.hpp## file is
visited automagically.

It also helps when you have three (or more) file extensions to
switch, for example, you could have ##.cpp##, ##.hpp## and ##.inc## extensions.
So, you could switch from a ##.cpp## file to a ##.hpp## file, from ##.hpp## to
##.inc##, and from ##.inc## to ##.cpp## again.

For good performance, be sure to byte-compile Lisp:switch-file.el, e.g.

   M-x byte-compile-file <give the path to switch-file.el when prompted>

This will generate ##switch-file.elc##, which will be loaded instead of
Lisp:switch-file.el.

SwitchFile was tested with GNU Emacs 21, 22 and 23.

I don't know if it is compatible with XEmacs.


== Usage ==

To use SwitchFile, insert in your ##~/.emacs##:

   (require 'switch-file)
   (setq switch-path (list <PATH-LIST>))

And, for example, to switch from a current ##.cc## file to a ##.hh##
corresponding file (or vice-versa) type:

   M-x switch-cc-to-h RET

As a suggestion for key bindings:

   (global-set-key [f3] 'switch-cc-to-h)

You can also include interactively a new path into ##switch-path## option via
##switch-path## command (which see).


== Options ==

Below it's shown a brief description of SwitchFile options,
please, see the options declaration in the code for a long
documentation.

; `switch-path' : Specify a path list for locating files to switch.

; `switch-major-mode-alist' : Specify a major mode alist.

To set the above options you may:


[new]
a. insert the code in your ##~/.emacs##, like:

   (setq switch-path '("some-dir/" "other-dir/"))

This way always keep your default settings when you enter a new
Emacs session.

[new]
b. or use `set-variable' in your Emacs session, like:

   M-x set-variable RET switch-path RET
   '("some-dir/" "other-dir/") RET

This way keep your settings only during the current Emacs
session.

[new]
c. or use customization, for example:

# click on MenuBar ##Options## option,
# then click on ##Customize Emacs##,
# then click on ##Browse Customization Groups##,
# expand ##Convenience## group,
# and then customize SwitchFile options.

Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not
when you leave out the current Emacs session.

[new]
d. or see the option value:

   C-h v switch-path RET

and click the ##customize## hypertext button.
Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not
when you leave out the current Emacs session.
