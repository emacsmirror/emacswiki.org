A mode that comes with Emacs that automagically inserts text into new buffers based on file extension or the major mode.  See GIT:autoinsert.el

For those of you annoyed by the "<tt>Copyright (C) YEAR  Free Software Foundation, Inc.</tt>" that's inserted by default into EmacsLisp buffers, set your <tt>ORGANIZATION</tt> environment variable.

Use it by running `M-x auto-insert-mode'.  Or manually insert new text in files with `M-x auto-insert'.  Try it with an elisp file, for example.  The result is quite impressive: The entire [[GPL]] notice will be inserted for you.

A common way to configure what should be inserted for a type of file is by adding a skeleton to the `auto-insert-alist'.  The syntax is based on SkeletonMode.

Here is a skeleton for a [[C++]] file that you can try by EvaluatingExpressions or by adding to you InitFile.

{{{
(eval-after-load 'autoinsert
  '(define-auto-insert
     '("\\.\\(CC?\\|cc\\|cxx\\|cpp\\|c++\\)\\'" . "C++ skeleton")
     '("Short description: "
       "/*" \n
       (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))
       " -- " str \n
       " */" > \n \n
       "#include <iostream>" \n \n
       "using namespace std;" \n \n
       "main()" \n
       "{" \n
       > _ \n
       "}" > \n)))
}}}

Auto Insert will insert the following (where the ##|## is point).

{{{
/*
  foo.cc -- Description of Foo.
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

main()
{
  |
}
}}}

Here's another skeleton, but for a C source file that you can try by EvaluatingExpressions or by adding to you InitFile.

{{{
(eval-after-load 'autoinsert
  '(define-auto-insert '("\\.c\\'" . "C skeleton")
     '(
       "Short description: "
       "/**\n * "
       (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))
       " -- " str \n
       " *" \n
       " * Written on " (format-time-string "%A, %e %B %Y.") \n
       " */" > \n \n
       "#include <stdio.h>" \n
       "#include \""
       (file-name-sans-extension
        (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)))
       ".h\"" \n \n
       "int main()" \n
       "{" > \n
       > _ \n
       "}" > \n)))
}}}

Auto Insert will insert the following (where the ##|## is point).

{{{

/**
 * foo.c -- Description of Foo
 *
 * Written on Tuesday, 21 August 2012.
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include "foo.h"

int main()
{
  |
}
}}}

Here's a skeleton for a Perl file that you can try by EvaluatingExpressions or by adding to you InitFile.

{{{
(eval-after-load 'autoinsert
  '(define-auto-insert '(perl-mode . "Perl skeleton")
     '("Description: "
       "#!/usr/bin/env perl" \n
       \n
       "use strict;" \n
       "use warnings;" \n \n
       _ \n \n
       "__END__" "\n\n"
       "=head1 NAME" "\n\n"
       str "\n\n"
       "=head1 SYNOPSIS" "\n\n\n"
       "=head1 DESCRIPTION" "\n\n\n"
       "=head1 COPYRIGHT" "\n\n"
       "Copyright (c) " (substring (current-time-string) -4) " "
       (getenv "ORGANIZATION") | (progn user-full-name) "\n\n"
       "This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or" "\n"
       "modify it under the same terms as Perl itself." "\n\n"
       "=cut" "\n")))
}}}

Auto Insert will insert the following (where the ##|## is point).

{{{
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

|

__END__

=head1 NAME

Description of Foo

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 COPYRIGHT

=cut
}}}

Another way of using autoinsert is to define files that contain the stuff to be inserted and connect them with a filename extension:

    (auto-insert-mode)  ;;; Adds hook to find-files-hook
    (setq auto-insert-directory "~/.mytemplates/") ;;; Or use custom, *NOTE* Trailing slash important
    (setq auto-insert-query nil) ;;; If you don't want to be prompted before insertion
    (define-auto-insert "\.py" "my-python-template.py")
    (define-auto-insert "\.php" "my-php-template.php")

I use Yasnippet for initial skeletons:

    (defun my/autoinsert-yas-expand()
      "Replace text in yasnippet template."
      (yas/expand-snippet (buffer-string) (point-min) (point-max)))

    (custom-set-variables
     '(auto-insert 'other)
     '(auto-insert-directory "~/autoinsert/")
     '(auto-insert-alist '((("\\.\\([Hh]\\|hh\\|hpp\\)\\'" . "C / C++ header") . ["template.h" c++-mode my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.\\([C]\\|cc\\|cpp\\)\\'" . "C++ source") . ["template.cc" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.sh\\'" . "Shell script") . ["template.sh" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.el\\'" . "Emacs Lisp") . ["template.el" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.pl\\'" . "Perl script") . ["template.pl" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.pm\\'" . "Perl module") . ["template.pm" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.py\\'" . "Python script") . ["template.py" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("[mM]akefile\\'" . "Makefile") . ["Makefile" my/autoinsert-yas-expand])
                           (("\\.tex\\'" . "TeX/LaTeX") . ["template.tex" my/autoinsert-yas-expand]))))
