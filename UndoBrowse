In ub terminology, the undo-history is seen as a movie, each step
being a frame of the movie. You can play (back/forth) the color-coded
movie-history of your document, and revert your document to the frame
you like.  To start, type M-x ub-quick-start.

If i could save the frames and replay it later, then it could be a useful demo tool. -- WilliamXu
