Bazaar (aka <code>bzr</code>) is a distributed version control system much like [[Git]], [[Mercurial]]
and DaRcs.

Bazaar is available from https://launchpad.net/bzr. The last update was in 2016.

== Modes ==

* [[VC]] -- supports Bazaar through the vc-bzr.el backend. It has been distributed with Emacs since version 22.1 [https://launchpad.net/vc-bzr ref].
* [[DVC]] -- supports Bazaar.
* Lisp:bazaar.el -- A user interface specific to Bazaar.

== Emacs no longer uses Bazaar ==

Emacs used Bazaar from 2009-2014. Nowadays, Emacs uses Git instead.

See [EmacsFromGit] or [GitForEmacsDevs].
