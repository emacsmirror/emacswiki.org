[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html Gnus supports GnuPG]
via the insertion of so-called MML secure tags, which contain encryption
instructions to be performed before a message is sent.  However, in the past I
sent plaintext e-mails (more than once, I'm afraid) that really should have
been encrypted ones.  To prevent myself from forgetting to encrypt e-mails
again, I wrote DefaultEncrypt.

DefaultEncrypt aims for automatic insertion of MML secure tags into messages
if public keys (either GnuPG public keys or S/MIME certificates) for
all recipients are available.  In addition, before a message is sent,
the user is asked if plaintext should really be sent unencryptedly when
public keys for all recipients are available.
This works by rebinding the standard keys for message sending
(`C-c C-c') and `C-c C-s') as well as by adding a check
to `gnus-message-setup-hook'.

A signed version of jl-encrypt.el is available
[http://www.informationelle-selbstbestimmung-im-internet.de/emacs/ over there].

==Installation==
Put Lisp:jl-encrypt.el into your load-path and add the following to ~/.emacs.
{{{
    (require 'jl-encrypt)
}}}
In general, no further configuration should be necessary.

==Sanity check==
Without any further configuration, send a GnuPG encrypted e-mail to
yourself as follows.  Enter your own e-mail address after To, choose some
Subject, and enter `M-x spook' in the body, which will insert suitable
text.  Then press `C-c C-c' to send the e-mail as usual (forgetting to
encrypt).  If you own a GnuPG public for the To e-mail address then you
will be asked whether you really want to send that e-mail as plaintext.
Answering `no' will insert an MML secure tag for you.  Press `C-c C-c'
again, and an encrypted e-mail will be sent.  If you receive that e-mail
with garbled attachments read the comment for `jl-gpg-without-mime'.

==Comment for `jl-gpg-without-mime'==
Control whether MML encryption should use MIME Security with OpenPGP.
RFC 3156 specifies how OpenPGP (and, thus, GnuPG) and MIME work together.
In Gnus, `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime' follows that standard.
An alternative is `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgp', which represents a
less powerful approach.  If you (like me in the past) happen to send
e-mails in an environment using broken M$ SMTP servers, then your
beautiful e-mails produced by `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime',
following RFC 3156, will be corrupted along the way.  E.g., the SMTP
server at my department throws away the e-mail's Content-Type
`multipart/encrypted' and its `protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"'
and inserts a meaningless `multipart/mixed' one.  Thus, the recipient
will have a hard time figuring out what the e-mail's strange attachments
are good for.  FUBAR.

If this variable is set to nil (the default) then your e-mails are built
according to RFC 3156.  I suggest that you send an encrypted e-mail to
yourself.  Complain to your IT department if you receive garbled
attachments.  Then set this variable to non-nil, while they are setting
up a reasonable SMTP server.

==Configuration for signatures==
The variable `jl-encrypt-without-signature' (default value t) controls
whether MML encryption tags should also produce signatures.
Set to nil to produce an MML tag that signs in addition to encryption.
In general, I'm not interested in signing my e-mails.  In contrast, I
believe that 
[http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/ off-the-record communication]
aims for the correct set of security goals:
Confidentiality with perfect forward secrecy, integrity,
and repudiability.
Unfortunately, that's not an option for e-mail.
