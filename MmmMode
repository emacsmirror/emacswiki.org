Multiple Major Modes ([https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/mmm-mode.html mmm-mode] on ELPA, [https://github.com/dgutov/mmm-mode GitHub]), originally by MichaelAbrahamShulman. 
It was once the method of choice for combining [MultipleModes major modes].

You can find description of using it, together with psgml-mode, php-mode, javascript-mode and css-mode to edit HTML files at HtmlModeDeluxe.  There is an example of using it at OracleProC.

There have been attempts to get it working with NxmlMode for XHTML, see NxmlModeForXHTML.
