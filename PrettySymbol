This page is about displaying sequences of characters as fancy characters or symbols -- for example, showing ##->## as -->.

Emacs 24.4 comes with a builtin ##prettify-symbols-mode##.  It can be customized by changing ##prettify-symbols-alist##.

* [https://github.com/drothlis/pretty-symbols pretty-symbols-mode] -- an attempt to replace most of the below with a proper package (available on [http://melpa.milkbox.net/ MELPA]) and under source control to facilitate contributions.
* PrettyLambda -- Show ##lambda## as the Greek letter.
* PrettyGreek -- Generalization of PrettyLambda for other Greek letters.
* TrentBuck's pretty symbols -- He says they horribly mess up wrapping (lines become too long) and alignment -- obvious if you do `##C-x v =##'.
