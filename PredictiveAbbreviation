;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The code provides a abbreviation expansion for Emacs.  Its fairly
;; similar to "dabbrev" expansion, which works based on the contents
;; of the current buffer (or other buffers).
;;
;; Predictive abbreviation expansion works based on the previously
;; written text.  Unlike dynamic abbreviation, the text is analysed
;; during idle time, while Emacs is doing nothing else.  `pabbrev-mode'
;; tells you when this is happening.  If this irritates you unset
;; `pabbrev-idle-timer-verbose'.  The advantage of this is that its
;; very quick to look up potential abbreviations, which means that the
;; can be constantly displayed, without interfering with the user as
;; they type.  Certainly it works for me, on an old laptop, typing as
;; fast as I can (which is fast, since I learnt to type with four
;; fingers).
;;
;; pabbrev's main entry point is through the minor mode
;; `pabbrev-mode'.  There is also a global minor mode, called
;; `global-pabbrev-mode', which does the same in all appropriate
;; buffers.

;; The current user interface looks like so...
;;
;; p[oint]
;; pr[ogn]
;; pre[-command-hook]
;; pred[ictive]
;;
;; As the user types the system narrows down the possibilities.  The
;; narrowing is based on how many times the words have been used
;; previously.  By hitting [tab] at any point the user can complete the
;; word.  The [tab] key is normally bound to `indent-line'.
;; `pabbrev-mode' preserves access to this command (or whatever else
;; [tab] was bound to), if there is not current expansion.
;;
;; Sometimes you do not want to select the most commonly occurring
;; word, but a less frequently occurring word.  You can access this
;; functionality by hitting [tab] for a second time.  This takes you
;; into a special suggestions buffer, from where you can select
;; secondary selections.  See `pabbrev-select-mode' for more
;; details. There is also an option `pabbrev-minimal-expansion-p'
;; which results in the shortest substring option being offered as the
;; first replacement.
;;
;; But is this actually of any use? Well having use the system for a
;; while now, I can say that it is sometimes.  I originally thought
;; that it would be good for text, but in general its not so
;; useful.  By the time you have realised that you have an expansion
;; that you can use, hit tab, and checked that its done the right
;; thing, you could have just typed the word directly in.  It's much
;; nicer in code containing buffers, where there tend to be lots of
;; long words, which is obviously where an abbreviation expansion
;; mechanism is most useful.
;;
;; Currently pabbrev builds up a dictionary on a per major-mode basis.
;; While pabbrev builds up this dictionary automatically, you can also
;; explicitly add a buffer, or a region to the dictionary with
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-buffer', or `pabbrev-scavenge-region'.  There is
;; also a command `pabbrev-scavenge-some' which adds some words from
;; around point.  pabbrev remembers the word that it has seen already,
;; so run these commands as many times as you wish.

== Customizations ==
Normally hitting ##TAB## a second time after a completion will take you to a suggestions buffer where you can select from alternate completions.  This bit of elisp hackery will instead use a pop-up list via auto-competion mode.  Make sure this is executed **after** ##pabbrev## is loaded.
