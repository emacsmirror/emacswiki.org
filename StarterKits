There are several so-called "starter kits" which provide default Emacs configurations that reflect the preferences of their creators.  They are all quite different from the default GnuEmacs default configuration. These are useful in obtaining configuration snippets and learning Emacs. In this context, it is also worth being aware of the [https://git.sr.ht/~pkal/ecg Emacs Configuration Generator]

[https://github.com/alphapapa/with-emacs.sh with-emacs.sh] by alphapapa could be one approach to try different configurations, including starter kits. The repo includes brief comparisons of alternatives.
