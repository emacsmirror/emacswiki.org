There are many so-called "starter kits" which provide default Emacs configurations that reflect the preferences of their creators.  You may also see them referred to as 'distros'. They are all quite different from the default GnuEmacs default configuration. They can be useful in obtaining configuration snippets and learning Emacs. In this context, it is also worth being aware of the [https://codeberg.org/pkal/ecg Emacs Configuration Generator].

[https://github.com/alphapapa/with-emacs.sh with-emacs.sh] by alphapapa could be one approach to trying different configurations, including starter kits. The repo includes brief comparisons of alternatives. 

Note: The 'starter kits' listed here are those specifically designed for public use (vs. personal configurations posted online/in Github.). 

The kits are ranked in very rough terms of popularity, as measured by the number of stars on their !GitHub repository (updated June 2025).  

'Active' indicates that there have been contributions to the repo within the last 12 months.

'Keybindings' indicates whether it ships with standard Emacs bindings or Evil-mode (Vim) modal bindings.

'Description' is taken from the description of the project in Github.

This should not be viewed as a comprehensive list.
