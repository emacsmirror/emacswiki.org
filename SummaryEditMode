Extracted from summarye.el:

= Description = 
list up matched strings from a buffer, and display them in summary buffer.

= Usage =
<pre>
;; 1. At first set autoload function in your .emacs like this:
;;    (autoload 'se/make-summary-buffer "summarye" nil t)
;;    (autoload 'soccur "summarye" nil t)
;; 2. [Optional] bind se/make-summary-buffer to your favorite key
;; sequence(or menu)
;;    like the following:
;;    (define-key help-map "M" 'se/make-summary-buffer)
;;    NOTE: You can use summarye from menu (Tools->Make summary) or
;;    M-x se/make-summary-buffer 
;; 3. Invoke it. You will get the summary buffer of current buffer. You
;;    will use it easily, I think.
;; 4. If you want to specify the item pattern, set the value to buffer-local
;;    variable se/item-delimiter-regexp like the following examples. The
;;    value must be either a regular expression string or a list of a list
;;    of a tag string and a regexp string. See examples.
;; 5. And if you want to specify the displayed string in summary buffer,
;;    assign a function to buffer-local variable
;;    se/item-name-constructor-function.

= Coding memo =
<pre>
;; * While cluster is an internal structure which index starts from
;;   zero, item means objects user can view like a displayed line or
;;   the corresponding text. Thus every commands do not have cluster
;;   in their names.
;; * In this program, term `face' is used. But it means not face but overlay.
