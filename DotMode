The minor mode `dot-mode.el' emulates the "." (redo) command of Vi (see ViAndEmacs).  It watches the changes you make to a buffer and gives you a keybinding (C-.) to redo those changes.  Conceptually, it is like having a macro automatically defined for the last set of changes you made.  It is maintained by RobertWyrick.

== Integration with god-mode ==
`god-mode` is a global minor mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys. It's similar to Vim's separation of command mode and insert mode.

You can emulate `vim` behavior by enabling `dot-mode` only when `god-mode` is disabled, and repeat things after:

    (defun my-god-repeat ()
      (interactive)
      (god-local-mode-pause)
      (dot-mode-execute)
      (god-local-mode-resume))

    (defun my-god-turn-dot ()
      (interactive)
      (dot-mode
        (if god-local-mode -1 1)))

    (add-hook 'god-local-mode-hook 'my-god-turn-dot)
    (define-key god-local-mode-map (kbd "C-.") #'my-god-repeat)
