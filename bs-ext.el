;; Extensions to emacs buffer-selection library (bs.el)
;; This extension allows you to bind keys to buffer selection configurations (using `bs-ext-config-keys'),
;; and optionally displays the configuration names and associated keybindings in the header line of the
;; *buffer-selection* buffer.
;; It also creates a new config called "regexp". When the "/" key is pressed the user is prompted for a regular
;; expression and any buffers with matching names are added to the "regexp" config.
;;
;; The following new keybindings are defined:
;;
;; /        : prompt user for regular expression, place matching buffers in "regexp" config, and change to that config
;; <left>   : select previous config using `bs-ext-select-previous-configuration'
;; <right>  : select next config using `bs-ext-select-next-configuration'
;; x        : kill buffer on current line using `bs-delete'
;;
;; Also if you have color-moccur installed you can use M-O to find regexp matches in marked buffers.


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put bs-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'bs-ext)

;;; Customize:
;;
;;  bs-ext-show-configs-header : whether or not to show the configs header line
;;  bs-ext-config-keys : alist of keybindings and associated config names  
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET bs RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;	
;; 2012/06/28
;;      * First released.

;;; TODO
;; 
;; Exclude empty groups? Allow manually adding buffers to a group.
;; Create "fast" group that rebinds up/down arrow keys so that the buffers are show in the other window automatically?

Aside from two header lines each line describes one buffer.

There are many key commands similar to `Buffer-menu-mode' for
manipulating the buffer list and buffers.
For faster navigation each digit key is a digit argument.
Different configurations are displayed in the header line. These can
be navigated using \\[bs-ext-select-previous-configuration] and \\[bs-ext-select-next-configuration],
or by pressing the associated shortcut keys displayed in brackets after
the config names (see `bs-ext-config-keys').

\\[bs-select] or SPACE -- select current line's buffer and other marked buffers.
\\[bs-toggle-show-all]  -- toggle between all buffers and a special subset.
\\[bs-select-other-window] -- select current line's buffer in other window.

    remain in Buffer Selection Menu.
\\[bs-mouse-select] -- select current line's buffer and other marked buffers.
\\[bs-save] -- save current line's buffer immediately.
\\[bs-delete] -- kill current line's buffer immediately.
\\[bs-toggle-readonly] -- toggle read-only status of current line's buffer.
\\[bs-clear-modified] -- clear modified-flag on that buffer.
\\[bs-mark-current] -- mark current line's buffer to be displayed.
\\[bs-unmark-current] -- unmark current line's buffer to be displayed.
\\[bs-show-sorted] -- display buffer list sorted by next sort aspect.
\\[bs-set-configuration-and-refresh] -- ask user for a configuration and \

\\[bs-ext-select-next-configuration] -- select and apply next \
available Buffer Selection Menu configuration.
\\[bs-ext-select-previous-configuration] -- select and apply previous \
available Buffer Selection Menu configuration.
\\[bs-ext-limit-by-regexp] -- display buffers with names matching regexp (prompt).
\\[bs-kill] -- leave Buffer Selection Menu without a selection.
\\[bs-toggle-current-to-show] -- toggle status of appearance.
