For some, remapping Control and CapsLock is one of the most important customizations for computer use in general and especially for Emacs.  The CapsLock function is virtually useless, yet has prime real estate on modern keyboards, while the left Ctrl key is awkwardly situated out of easy reach for those of us without giant fingers.    When I was new to Linux and first tried emacs, I quickly gave up and went back to pico, thinking, "Who would want to use an editor that uses one of the hardest-to-reach keys for nearly everything?"

Old Unix keyboards had these keys' positions inverted, and Sun keyboards always have.  It seems the current layout became standard about the same time cheap x86 hardware became ubiquitous, although why is beyond me.  [Note that the original IBM PC keyboards also had the Control key in the right place; it was only with the 101-key "enhanced" keyboards that it was moved to its currently useless position.]

It is possible to embrace this "new" keyboard layout, however, and go a step further than just swapping Control and CapsLock keys - and SwapControlAltAndCapsLock for an old Unix or Sun keyboard-like experience.  It's a mindblowing change for the first few days, but it makes keyboard usage much simpler and easier.

There are many, many different ways to make CapsLock work as an additional control key.  You only need to pick one of the following from the list, usually whichever one seems easiest to you.  Do note, however, that the keyboard mappings are separate for X (graphical) applications and for Linux virtual terminals.  (Sidenote: This problem may be alleviated soon as Debian's <code>/etc/default/keyboard</code> file appears designed to work for both virtual terminals and X.)


== Gnome Desktop Environment ==

Recent versions of the Gnome desktop have a Keyboard Preferences dialog that allows you to configure the Ctrl key position.  On Ubuntu this is found under System -> Preferences -> Keyboard.  Under the "Layout Options" tab choose "Ctrl key position" and it gives you a number of choices.

[[image:GnomeKeyboardPreferences.png|Gnome Keyboard Preferences|thumb]]
[[image:GnomeKeyboardLayoutOptions.png|Gnome Keyboard Layout Options|right]]

== KDE Desktop Environment ==

In KDE 4.x there's a "Keyboard Layout" dialog in the Systems settings that allow you to modify the Caps Lock behavior. First be sure to allow KDE to control keyboard layouts. Do this by selecting "Enable keyboard layouts" here:

[[image:KDEKeyboardPreferences.png|KDE Keyboard Layout|thumb]]

Then turn on the desired options and press the apply button:

[[image:KDEKeyboardAdvancedOptions.png|KDE Keyboard Layout Advanced Options|thumb]]


== X (using xmodmap) ==
In the X Windowing System you can use <code>xmodmap(1)</code> to change the keymaping.  Some desktop environments, like Gnome and KDE, which use X, have specialized preference menus to make this easier.  The advantage of using <code>xmodmap</code> is that it will work with any desktop or Window Manager.

See the man page command [http://vmlinux.org/cgi-bin/man2html?xmodmap xmodmap(1x)] for more information.  I swap their functions throughout my environment, not just for Emacs.

On Unix-like systems, I have a ~/.xmodmap file:
<pre>
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
</pre>

which is sourced from my ~/.xsession with the line:
<pre>
xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
</pre>


== X (using xkb) ==
In the X Window System, you can also swap Control and Caps Lock with the xkb option <code>ctrl:swapcaps</code>.  If you don't ever need Caps Lock you can instead of swapping the two set Caps Lock to be another Control. This is done with <code>ctrl:nocaps</code>. Use one of these from command line:
<pre>
  setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps     # Swap Left Control and Caps Lock
  setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps       # Make Caps Lock a Control key
</pre>

Note that the above will change your keyboard layout to a us keyboard layout. If it is not a US keyboard layout, you need to add a switch with your layout, like:

<pre>
  setxkbmap -layout gb -option ctrl:nocaps # Caps Lock is Control on a GB keyboard
</pre>

If you don't know your keyboard layout name, I think it is always the second value inside the xkb_symbols include line if you setxkbmap -print, so this command should preserve it for you:
<pre>
  setxkbmap -layout "$(setxkbmap -print | awk -F + '/xkb_symbols/ {print $2}')" -option ctrl:nocaps
</pre>

You can put this command in your <code>~/.xsession</code>, <code>~/.gnomerc</code> or whatever.  If you can edit the X configuration file, you might do it system-wide:
<pre>
  Section "InputDevice"
    Driver "keyboard"
    Option "XkbRules" [...]
    Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:nocaps"
</pre>

The CapsKey page has an example of moving Ctrl to Caps.

== Virtual terminals ==

A virtual terminal is NOT an <code>[agkux]term</code> inside of X.  It is the white-on-black text-only mode that scares some people who have been traumatized by Microsoft's COMMAND.COM shell.  If you do not use virtual terminals, there is no reason for you to read this section.  

=== Generic GNU/Linux Virtual Terminal (any distribution) ===

''Note: while these instructions should work under any distribution of GNU/Linux, you may wish to use a distribution-specific method which may be simpler.''

Press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to enter the first virtual terminal.

Now run:

 $ sudo dumpkeys | head -1 > /usr/share/keymaps/Caps2Ctrl.map

Then add the following lines to that file:

 keycode 58 = Control #This makes Caps act as Ctrl
 # keycode 29 = Caps_Lock #This makes Ctrl act as Caps
 # alt_is_meta #This fixes the Alt key

Then run loadkeys on that file:

 $ sudo loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/Caps2Ctrl.map

To revert run:

 $ sudo loadkeys -d #load default keymap file

For more extensive editing try:

 $ dumpkeys > my_keymap
 $ cp my_keymap trial_keymap
 $ edit trial_keymap
 $ sudo loadkeys trial_keymap

 $ man keymaps

  It should be noted that using numeric notation for the
  keysyms is highly unportable as the key action numbers
  To find out what keysyms there are available  for  use
  in keymaps files, use the command

        dumpkeys --long-info

  Unfortunately,  there  is  currently no description of
  what each symbol does. It has to be guessed  from  the
  name or figured out from the kernel sources.

=== On Debian GNU/Linux (console-setup method, newer) ===

To make CAPS LOCK another control key, edit the file '''/etc/default/keyboard''' and change the line which reads 
 
 XKBOPTIONS=""

to 

 XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"		# Some people prefer "ctrl:swapcaps"

To make the change effective:

 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh console-setup

=== On Debian GNU/Linux (console-tools method, older) ===

To make Caps Lock another control, add/uncomment the following line in <code>/etc/console-tools/remap</code>

 s/keycode  58 = Caps_Lock/keycode  58 = Control/;

To make the change effective:

 $ sudo invoke-rc.d console-screen.sh restart

=== On Ubuntu GNU/Linux virtual terminal ===

Ubuntu Maverick

Click on System > Preferences > Keyboard 

This will open the Keyboard preferences. In "Layout" tab find "options..." then locate "Ctrl key position"

select "Swap Ctrl and CapsLock"

or also you can select "Make CapsLock an additional Ctrl"

this also work for virtual terminals

1. Edit /etc/default/console-setup and add an X11 style caps lock modification:

 $ diff -U0 /etc/default/{console-setup.orig,console-setup}
 --- /etc/default/console-setup.orig     2009-02-09 03:05:27.000000000 -0500
 +++ /etc/default/console-setup  2009-02-09 04:11:20.000000000 -0500
 @@ -40 +40 @@
 -XKBOPTIONS=""
 +XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:swapcaps"

you can do "ctrl:nocaps" instead if you want to two control keys.

2. Trick dpkg into integrating your changes:

 $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

and choose all the defaults.

(The above is a brief version of a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/console-tools/+bug/140786/comments/7 bug comment])

=== On Gentoo Linux ===

For i386 systems, to make Caps Lock another control: In /etc/conf.d/keymaps set 

  KEYMAP="emacs"

Then run <code># /etc/init.d/keymaps restart</code> (or reboot).  See /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs.map.gz for more information.

=== On Slackware GNU/Linux ===

Similar to Gentoo, you can add Caps Lock as another control key:

As super-user: 

  $ loadkeys emacs
  $ echo "loadkeys emacs" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

You can just issue the second command and re-run rc.local, however
that will initiate any commands in rc.local.  This differs from my X
setup where the menu key is used as Caps Lock.  Currently for the
virtual console there is no Caps Lock (any suggestions on this?)

I no longer have Caps Lock key too but I have never used it before so
I do not see the need now it has been remapped to something else ;) -- XavierMaillard

[new]
The main thing I use the CapsLock for is environment variables; I have started getting out of using it by using AbbrevMode, however I still find some instances where it's useful.  

After seeing how a friend of mine types (with her wrists flat on the table, and not moving her hands but straining to reach keys, also while holding modifier keys and depressing letters with the same hand), I'm seriously investigating whether the quirks of heavy keyboard use (dislike of CapsLock, accidentally hitting keys, RSI) are due to poor hand position instead of heavy typing use.  I've been typing heavily for years, and other than moving the CtrlKey, I've not developed any problems or developed the strong preferences indicated on some webpages.  I'd like to get a HappyHacking or Sun-style keyboard, but I'm concerned that nobody thinks it's a problem to only have one control key: the rationalization I've seen some people make is that I should use one hand to accomplish certain keystrokes (e.g., "\C-x\C-f", which I do rather more swiftly with two hands).  

[new]
If you don't have a CapsLock key, it's still easy to type environment variables.  Just use <code>M-b M-u</code> to uppercase the last word.  -- HackerB9

=== NetBSD console ===

To /etc/wscons.conf add:
: mapfile /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c

then create the file /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c with the single line:
: keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L

This can also be tested immediately (doesn't require reboot) and temporarily (won't survive a reboot) with:
wsconsctl -w map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"

== OS X ==

Check out uControl http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/ for switching
keys on a mac; it does Caps/Ctrl but other switches too.

Starting with Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) you can remap modifier keys (including "Caps Lock" to "Control") in the "Keyboard & Mouse" System Preference Panel.

In Emacs 22 (Carbon Port, CVS version) you can use the variable `mac-control-modifier' to remap the Control key.

Use the menu item: "<Apple Menu>/System Preferences...", select the "Keyboard & Mouse" panel, select the "Keyboard" tab and press the "Modifier Keys..." button at the lower left to bring up a remapping dialog where you can make the desired changes.  The remapping is effective throughout the OS X UI including within Apple's X11 implementation.


== Microsoft Windows ==

=== AutoHotkey ===
On Windows you can use the [http://www.autohotkey.com/ AutoHotkey] program which uses "scripts" to remap the keyboard.

This method has a couple benefits.  One is scripts can be compiled to a stand alone <tt>.exe</tt> file which can be executed on a machine that doesn't have !AutoHotkey.  Another is, the key re-mapping can be set to only apply in emacs; the caps lock key will behave normaly in every other program. (If that's what you want.)

To remap the Caps Lock key to Ctrl save the following to a file named <tt><i>script</i>.ahk</tt>.  Then execute the script with AutoHotKey by double clicking it.  See the [http://autohotkey.free.fr/docs/Scripts.htm#ahk2exe  AHK2EXE] documentation to learn how to make scripts into stand alone executables.

    #IfWinActive emacs  ; if in emacs
    +Capslock::Capslock ; make shift+Caps-Lock the Caps Lock toggle
    Capslock::Control   ; make Caps Lock the control button
    #IfWinActive        ; end if in emacs

The original Caps Lock behavior is here mapped to Shift + Caps Lock.

If you want the caps lock to be the control key everywhere remove the lines that begin with "#IfWinActive".

If you want this AHK script to remain in effect across windows restarts place the script in your startup folder.
See the [http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup startup section of the AHK FAQ] for more specific directions.

=== Registry ===
* Applies across all user accounts.
* Requires Administrator access to write to the registry.

====NoCaps====
<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00
</pre>

====SwapCaps====
<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,3a,00,1d,00,00,00,00,00
</pre>


This can also be done by manually editing the registry to accomplish the same thing, see [http://geekquanta.blogspot.com/2007/07/remapping-ctrl-and-caps-lock-in-windows.html] for an explanation. The Synaptics touchpad driver for Windows reads the unmodified scancodes while 'PalmTouch' is active, so if you switch Ctrl and Capslock you will also have to turn off PalmTouch if you want to send 'Ctrl-Taps' using the touchpad.

[new]
You can instead make similar changes to
<pre>
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout]
</pre>
which makes the change for just the current user only.

===Keymap===
There is a small piece of software called '''keymap''' which modifies the registry. 

===KeyMapper===
It seems that keymap.exe does not work on Windows 7. KeyMapper (http://code.google.com/p/keymapper/) works fine.

=== In Lisp? ===
I know this is fairly simple to do for emacs only, but I've never looked into how exactly, and Lisp is not my forte.  Anyone?

: That is doubtful.

:: I am able to get the xorg under Cygwin on windows to switch the keys via a command line argument to xwin.  Surely then it should be possible to patch emacs to do this at least at the source level.  Anyone?  
:: Also, what do you mean by "last method?" I don't see a method on here that doesn't require Administrator access.  I'd love to know one.

::: I think that when you run emacs through cygwin, it uses its own x server. When you give a command lin e switch to remap keys, you are effectively doing it across all of your X server. It just happens that your X server is only running emacs.
::: As far as I know, X does not allow per-application custom keybindings.

:: %%EmacsW32%% , with w32-enable-caps-lock set to nil , reads that key as <capslock>.  It should be possible to tell Emacs to treat it as a control.  (define-key function-key-map [(capslock)] 'event-apply-control-modifier) gets close.

=== Drivers ===
There are also these drivers: [http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/ctrl2cap.shtml ctrl2cap.sys] or [http://www.sysinternals.com/win9x/utilities/ctrl2cap95.shtml ctrl2cap.vxd].

http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html#capscontrol has more info about this.

Microsoft also provides an utility [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/Ctrl2Cap.mspx Ctrl2Cap] to replace the caps lock with the ctrl key.  (Note that you will lose the caps lock.)
It allows you to reverse it as well.

If you use the AutoHotKey (www.autohotkey.com) Win32 macro program, the following line in autohotkey.ini will effectively remap Caps to Ctrl:

<pre>
Capslock::Ctrl
</pre>
