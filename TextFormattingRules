[[es:WikiCómo]]
How do you learn to format Wiki pages?

* Use the SandBox page to test stuff!
* Check how others have done things you want to do (bullets, indentation, whatever): Click '''Edit this page''' at the bottom of a page to see its source code.
* Use '''Preview''' when you edit, to see the effect of what you write.

[:basics]
== Basics ==

Generally, it is important to use as little markup as possible:
# It makes the "source code" easier to read and modify.
# On the other hand, we also want to make the text easy to read.
# This sometimes calls for making things stand out.
# These two goals can sometimes conflict.

These are the most important formatting rules:

* Empty lines separate paragraphs.
* Paragraphs may span several lines.
* Paragraphs begin in column 1.
* For simple words and sentences:
** ##*bold*##, ##/italic/##, ##_underline_##
   -> *bold*, /italic/, _underline_ (the pattern matching is pretty restrictive, to prevent mismatches).
** ##%%*escaped*%%## -> %%*escaped*%% (instead of bold, by ignoring markup)
** <code>##*escaped and monospaced*##</code>
   -> ##*escaped and monospaced*## (instead of bold and variable width)
* The following markup works as well, and even in some contexts where the basic punctuation-based markup  (##*bold*##, ##/italic/##, ##_underline_##)
does ''not'' work:
** ##//italic//## or ##''italic''## -> ''italic''
** ##**bold**## or ##'''bold'''## -> '''bold'''
** ##__underline__## -> __underline__
* Variable names can be surrounded by matching quotes, a syntax used in EmacsLisp and in [[Info]]: ##`foo'## -> `foo'.
* For horizontal lines, use hyphens (##----##) on a separate line. Horizontal lines are used for the category section of pages, see WikiOrganization.
* For a short punctuation dash (//en//-dash) in a sentence use two hyphens (##--##) surrounded by spaces.
** ##--## -> -- 
* For a long punctuation dash (//em//-dash) in a sentence use three hyphens (##---##).
** ##---## -> ---

[:AlternativeMarkup]
== Alternative Markup ==

The basic punctuation-based markup (see above) is preferable in all cases where it works. Alternative markup works in some additional contexts.






[:WikiTags]
=== Wiki Tags ===

The following markup tags have special effects on this wiki.  Use them like HTML tags. 

; '''##<code>##''': Code (usually monospaced, plus escaping of wiki
processing): %%<code>foo</code>%% -> <code>foo</code>

; '''##<nowiki>##''': No wiki processing (usually to unlink mixed case words): ##<nowiki>[[No Link]]</nowiki>## -> <nowiki>[[No Link]]</nowiki>

; '''##<pre>##''': Preformatted (usually monospaced, for paragraphs, plus
whitespace is preserved, plus escaping of wiki processing). ##<pre>## tags must be alone on a line, to work. Example: to produce a line with ##foo##, use this:

        <pre>
        foo
        </pre>






[:htmltags]
=== HTML Tags ===

The following standard HTML tags can be used on the wiki.  Use them like HTML tags.

; '''##<u>##''': <u>underline</u>: ##<u>foo bar (toto)</u>## -> <u>foo bar (toto)</u>

; '''##<i>##''': <i>Italics</i>: ##<i>foo bar (toto)</i>## -> <i>foo bar (toto)</i>

; '''##<b>##''': <b>Bold</b>: ##<b>foo bar (toto)</b>## -> <b>foo bar (toto)</b>

; '''##<tt>##''': <tt>Teletype</tt> (usually monospaced): ##<tt>foo bar (toto)</tt>## -> <tt>foo bar (toto)</tt>

; '''##<em>##''': <em>Emphasis</em> (usually italics): ##<em>foo bar (toto)</em>## -> <em>foo bar (toto)</em>

; '''##<strong>##''': <strong>Strong</strong> (usually bold): ##<strong>foo bar (toto)</strong>## -> <strong>foo bar (toto)</strong>






[:bbcode]
=== BBCode ===

“BBCode is an abbreviation for Bulletin Board Code, the lightweight markup language used to format posts in many message boards. The available tags are usually indicated by rectangular brackets surrounding a keyword, and they are parsed by the message board system before being translated into a markup language the web browsers understands, usually HTML or XHTML” -- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode Wikipedia]

{{{
[b]this text is bold[/b]
[i]this text is italic[/i]
[u]this text is underlined[/u]
[s]this text is striked through[/s] [strike]and this too[/strike]
[tt]monospaced text[/tt]
[sub]subscript[/sub] [sup]superscript[/sup]
[color=blue]this text is blue[/color]

  [*]item one
  [*]item two
[/list]
:) :-) ☺ (smile)
:( :-( ☹ (frown)
}}}

Note that traditionally, ##[url‍=http://www.example.org/]text[/url]## would also be allowed. Apparently spammers also like it, which is why it ended up on BannedRegexps.






[:links][:anchors]
== Links and Anchors ==

* Words in %%CamelCase%% (mixed case) are transformed
into links to other wiki pages.  This works best for ASCII characters (a-z and A-Z),
because the wiki doesn't know what case non-ASCII characters have.
* You use ! in front of mixed case word to prevent making it into link:
** ##!NoLink## -> !NoLink
* %%[[Words in double brackets]]%% are also transformed into
links to other wiki pages.  This works for all characters except punctuation characters.
* You can create PermanentAnchors to serve as targets of links. You can link to an anchor on the same page or on a different page.
* To create a new page, just add a link to it from an existing page and
click on the question-mark link that appears after the page name.
See CreateNewPages.
* Just type a URL to link to it. A URL ending in .png or .jpg links to an image that is displayed on the same page.  See UploadingImages.
* To link a piece of text, use the URL with whitespace and the link text in square brackets.
** %%[http://www.vim.org/ Vim]%% -> [http://www.vim.org/ Vim]
* The InterMap lists some prefixes you might want to use occasionally.
** WikiPedia:Emacs
** EmacsWiki:action=history;id=SiteMap
* To give an EmacsWiki action link text, follow the action with whitespace and link text in square brackets (mysteriously, just like a URL)
** %%[EmacsWiki:action=edit;id=SandBox Play in the Sandbox]%% -> [EmacsWiki:action=edit;id=SandBox Play in the Sandbox]
* To link to an index entry in the Emacs manual, use prefix `Manual' -- see EmacsManual.
* See also InterLinks for URL abbreviations for commonly used Web sites, and NearLinks for linking to nearby Wikis.
* It is a good idea to provide links to appropriate category (or "parent") pages at the bottom of a page -- see WikiOrganization.






[:actions][:action][:wikiactions]
== Wiki actions ==
The reflexive intermap-link %%EmacsWiki%% has some of the following actions:
* EmacsWiki:action=history;id=SiteMap
* EmacsWiki:action=edit;id=SandBox
* to show all contributions by a user:  EmacsWiki:action=rc;all=1;showedit=1;from=1;rcuseronly=AlexSchroeder
* To give an EmacsWiki action link text, follow the action with whitespace and link text in square brackets (mysteriously, just like a URL)
** %%[EmacsWiki:action=edit;id=SandBox Play in the Sandbox]%% -> [EmacsWiki:action=edit;id=SandBox Play in the Sandbox]

A more complete list can be found at http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/Action_List






[:Lists][:Bullets]
== Lists ==

Lists and indented paragraphs start with a special character ''followed by at least one space character''. For example, a bulleted list item starts with `##* ##', not with just `##*##'.

* A bulleted list is an unordered list. List items start with an asterisk (`##*##').
** A sublist item starts with two asterisks (`##**##')
*** a level 3 with (`##***##'), and so on
* etc.

# A numbered list is an ordered list that uses numbers sequentially as labels. List items start with a pound sign (`<code>#</code>').
# second item
## ordered sublist (with `<code>##</code>')
# etc.

; Definition list: A definition list is a list with text labels. Items in definition lists start with a semi-colon (`##;##') and a space (see above), followed by any amount of text, and the description starts with a colon ('##:##'). Your syntax should look like this:
{{{
           ; Term: Description.
}}}
; Example: This list is an example of definition list
; Third item: and its definition

See [[#ListIndentation|Indentation]] for how to add a separate paragraph (or a line break) to a list item (i.e., at the same indentation level).




[:indendation]
== Indentation ==

* Indented lines start with one or more colons, followed by one or more whitespace characters [space or tabs]
* ('##: ##') -- more colons mean more indention. 
* Indented lines must be the first sentence in a paragraph.\\
 (This is useful for personal replies or blockquotes. See also [[#Dialog]].)

[:ListIndentation]
* You can use two backslashes '''##\\##''', to insert a line break at the current indentation level. The previous list item shows an example: ##\\## is used between ##paragraph.## and ##(This is useful##.\\\\
To create the appearance of a separate paragraph (like this one) within a list item, you can use '''##\\\\##'''.





[:tables]
== Tables ==

For tabular information that doesn't fit in lists or definition lists, use tables.

For example, this table has two columns, with the second row having an empty first column, and the third and final column spanning all the rows.

{{{
||First row||||Second column||
|| ||Not empty||
||||Span the columns||
}}}

Becomes:

||First row||||Second column||
|| ||Not empty||
||||Span the columns||

Official documentation is at [[Oddmuse:Table Markup Extension]].




[:Dialog]
== Dialog ([new]) ==

Conversation should be separated with ##[new]## on a line by itself (starting in column 1).  Currently, everything below each ##[new]## is visually separated by having an alternate background color.

Alternate contributions (alternate ##[new]##'s) are shaded, like this:

[new]
Someone's contribution...
[new]
Someone else's contribution.
[new]
Another contribution.
[new]
Yet another.

Putting
<tt>
[<nowiki>new::</nowiki>]
</tt>
will insert your UserName, and adds a timestamp to your contribution when you save the page.  The timestamp appears when you move the mouse over the contribution.  See also UsingPortraits.

[new:SamuelBronson:2009-04-29 17:33 UTC]

##<rant>##

Please refrain from altering the above example's wiki markup in an attempt to "clean it up"; usually this leaves it looking like this:
<pre>
[new:SamuelBronson:2009-04-29 17:27 UTC]
</pre>
##<nowiki>##, ##<code>##, ##<pre>##, {{##...##}}, etc. do not prevent it's being expanded; you must actually prevent those characters from all appearing next to one another in the source of the page in order to prevent their being expanded. (This is arguably a bug.) Also, we must use ##<tt>## to get fixed-width formatting because otherwised the ##<nowiki>## tags used to break up the string show up:
<pre>
[<nowiki>new::</nowiki>]
</pre>
##</rant>##

[new]

A contribution after a ##[new]## ends at either the next ##[new]##, the next heading (see below), or the next horizontal line (see above).

Use headings, horizontal lines or even new pages to separate threads of discussions, but use ##[new]## to separate entries in the thread.






[:SourceCode]
== Source Code ==

* Pages starting with three semicolons (##;;;##) are formatted as code.  No other rules are applied.

* Lines starting with one or more spaces are formatted as code.  We suggest
four (4) spaces.

* Lines between tags ##{{{## and ##}}}## are formatted as code.

*  '''##<code>##''': Code (usually monospaced, plus escaping of wiki processing): %%<code>foo</code>%% -> <code>foo</code> (see [[#WikiTags|WikiTags]] above)

*  '''##<pre>##''': Preformatted (usually monospaced, for paragraphs, plus
whitespace is preserved, plus escaping of wiki processing). ##<pre>## tags must be alone on a line, to work. (see [[#WikiTags|WikiTags]] above)

* Include [[Gists]]






[:headings]
== Headings ==

Headings are enclosed in equals signs (%%=%%) on a line of their own.  You can use up to six equals signs to produce headers of level one to
six.  Level one is the most important one, and should not be used
because the page title already uses a level one heading.  This is why
level one headings are automatically translated to level two headings.

Example:

{{{
== Heading 2 ==
=== Heading 3 ===
}}}

Using two or three equals signs is recommended (##== like this ==##).
Nothing beyond a level 4 heading is supported by the [[CSS]] stylesheet.
After level 4, they are not displayed differently.
Overuse of headings is poor style, as short Wiki pages are
preferred to long ones.  Consider splitting the page into two or more
pages.






[:images]
== Images ==

To put an image on a page, insert the URL with an image suffix.

Example:

  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs_logo.png

Result:

http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs_logo.png

Alternatively, put '''image:''' and a page name inside double square brackets to insert inline images.  The images must exist on the Wiki, or be uploaded to a page on the Wiki.  See UploadingImages.

Example:

  [[image:AngryFruitSaladTwo_Screenshot]]

Result:

[[image:AngryFruitSaladTwo_Screenshot]]






[:irc]
== IRC Quotes ==

Discussions in the EmacsChannel can be copied directly to the Wiki.

Example:

{{{
<hybrid> emacs has a text adventure game in it
<PyroMithrandir> emacs IS a text adventure game
}}}

Result:

<hybrid> emacs has a text adventure game in it
<PyroMithrandir> emacs IS a text adventure game





[:transclusion]
== Inclusion / Transclusion == 

A page on the wiki can "include" other pages.  This is especially helpful for marking certain pages as out-of-date, requiring refactoring, candidates for deletion, or wiki projects.

{{{
<include "ExamplePage">
}}}

There is more to it, however. See Oddmuse:Transclusion.

The resulting HTML doesn't tell you that !ExamplePage has been transcluded, but if you're on !ExamplePage, clicking on the header will search for it. It's up to the users to use a decent prefix to identify pages that are to be transcluded and to mention the page name this piece of text is from.






[:redirect]
== Rename / Redirect ==

To change the name of a page without losing all of the archived links to the original name, create a new page with the original content and new name, and ''redirect'' the old name, by replacing the entire page with:
<code>#REDIRECT FooBar</code>", where "!FooBar" is the new, target Wiki page, 
or <code>#REDIRECT [[Foobar]]</code> for non-camel-case words.
