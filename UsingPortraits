[b]NOTE: Portraits are no longer supported or encouraged on this Wiki.[/b]

This page explains how to use portraits in discussions on this wiki.

Short summary:

* Use a URL to an external [b]48x48[/b] image.
* Put <code>portrait: <url></code> on the top of your page.
** ''Note:'' This must be the URL of the image itself, *not* the Web page where the image might be displayed.
* Save your homepage. You should see your portrait.
* When you use <code>[new:AlexSchroeder:2004-12-23 20:09 UTC]</code> on a page somewhere, it will automatically be expanded to <code>[new:<username>:<date>]</code> and it will show your portrait.
* This *only* works if your username is also the name of your homepage.

== [new] ==

When you are using ThreadMode instead of DocumentMode, ie. appending personal statements to a discussion instead of writing pages that could be part of a manual, then you should introduce your statements with <code>[new]</code>.
This changes the background color of your statements.

Example:

    [new]
    Like this.

Result:

[new]
Like this.

== [new:page:popup] ==

If you use <code>[new:page:popup]</code>, then /page/ will be searched for a line starting with <code>portrait:</code> and an URL.  If such an URL is found, it is inlined as an image.
/popup/ will be used as a tooltip for your image.

Definition example:

    portrait:http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/pics/alex-furious.jpg
    Note how text flows around the image.

Result:

portrait:http://www.emacswiki.org/alex/pics/alex-furious.jpg
Note how text flows around the image.

----

Usage example:

    [new:UsingPortraits:Yadda yadda!]
    Let your mouse pointer hover over the image!

Result:

[new:UsingPortraits:Yadda yadda!]
Let your mouse pointer hover over the image!

== [new:page:2004-12-23 20:09 UTC] and [new:AlexSchroeder:2004-12-23 20:09 UTC] ==

If you don't specify a page or popup text, this will be expanded to 
##[new:<username>:<date>]## when saving the page.

If you have a portrait defined on your homepage, and the name of your homepage is the same as your username, then
the portrait will be inlined as an image.
A timestamp  will be used as a popup on the image.

Example:


: <tt>[new:<nowiki>:</nowiki>]</tt>
: ##More eye-candy!  :)##

Result:
[new:AlexSchroeder:2004-12-23 20:09 UTC]
More eye-candy!  :)

I'd prefer it if we didn't use weird icons, avatars, screenshots, or anything like that.
I want to enable us to add a human touch to the wiki.
We have enough symbolic overload on the web.

[new:NicFerrier:2013-02-03 16:20 UTC]
I wonder if we should have an index page of all avatars and their locations?

[new:NicFerrier:2013-02-03 16:31 UTC]
Also it seems that we should limit the size of these as we display?

[new:wi24rd:2019-01-26 07:35 UTC]
It seems like this function broken for displaying image?

[new]
Yes, this no longer works unless your image is hosted on the wiki itself (which I don't
want to encourage) because of CSPR. I think we should just no longer use it. :)
