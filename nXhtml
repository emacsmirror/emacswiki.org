This package is no longer being developed since (last commit in 2012, see also https://answers.launchpad.net/nxhtml/+question/236477).  The old webpage is no longer up, but may still be found at archive.org; the code may be found at https://code.launchpad.net/nxhtml.

== Description ==

'''nXhtml''' is a package that may help for web development, but it also contains a lot of other things.
For an overview see [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416162438/http://ourcomments.org:80/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html nXhtml home
page].
You may also find the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150407040752/http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/tut/tutorials.html tutorials] useful.

One of the main parts is the major mode nxhtml-mode for editing XHTML files (based on NxmlMode).
This gives XHTML completion of tags and attributes also in for example php files (even if they do not contain XML + DTD specifications).

Another main part handles [[MultipleModes|multiple major modes]] (using MuMaMo).
It defines *multi major modes*, often with names
like /html-mumamo/, /nxhtml-mumamo/, /eruby-html-mumamo/, /django-html-mumamo/,
/genshi-nxhtml-mumamo/, /smarty-html-mumamo/ etc.
Those modes handle inlined style sheets and javascript, php, jsp etc, which are interleaved with the HTML.


There are a lot of other features like simple search and replace in directory trees, simple file upload, etc.
The only way to find out is to download nXhtml and try.

=== Quick Start ===

Installation is easy, just unzip the archive and (just as README.txt says) add one line to your .emacs:

  (load "YOUR-PATH-TO/nxhtml/autostart")

After this nXhtml is ready for use.
However for a little more and where to download it see
[https://web.archive.org/web/20150416162438/http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html#qg the Quick Guide to nXhtml].
See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150416162438/http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml-changes.html nXhtml Notes and Changes]
for a list of changes.

You need **Emacs 22** or later to use nXhtml.

=== Changing file associations ===

These are defined in /nxhtml/nxhtml/nxhtml-autoload.el in the function nxhtml-setup-file-assoc, so just modify 'auto-mode-alist as normal.

== Libraries included in the package nXhtml ==

**nXhtml** comes with a lot of elisp libraries, some of which you can use separately.
I used to have a list here, but I always forget to update that so I have removed it.
Please download the whole library if you are interested in some special pieces.
Or, pick them from the 
[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nxhtml/nxhtml/main/files/head%3A/ latest version sources on Launchpad] (this may be a beta version though).

Note: Some of the files used to be here on Emacs Wiki too, but I decided to delete them since the latest version of them are now easily available from there.
The files I have deleted are 
ediff-url.el,
freemind.el,
tabkey2.el and
w32-print.el.
