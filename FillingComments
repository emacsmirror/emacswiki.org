If you want to fill source code comments /without/ filling the source code itself, you can use ##comment-auto-fill-only-comments## in Emacs >= 24

{{{
 (add-hook 'prog-mode
   (lambda ()
     (auto-fill-mode 1)
     (setq-local comment-auto-fill-only-comments t)))
}}}

in older emacs versions, you can tell emacs to only fill if the point is 
in a comment block. this example uses c-mode.

{{{
 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
	   (lambda ()
	     (auto-fill-mode 1)
	     (set (make-local-variable 'fill-nobreak-predicate)
		  (lambda ()
		    (not (eq (get-text-property (point) 'face)
			     'font-lock-comment-face))))))
}}}

: I'm using GNU EMACS from CVS (2004-08-28) and it seems that this feature is built in. Also AFAIR this feature was built in in 21.3.1  -- mina86

The package [http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/libit/dist/misc/rebox.el rebox.el] may also help with refilling multi-line comments within 
a comment "box".  For example, 

<pre>
  /*---------------------------------------------.
  | Called by semantic_selection().              |
  |                                              |
  | Performs two checks in the following order:  |
  |                                              |
  | A) If our time limit has changed between     |
  | calls to this function, extension of each    |
  | maxiset by each of its failed SOS clauses is |
  | attempted.                                   |
  |                                              |
  | B) If any maxiset has a new model            |
  | (witnessing its consistency) each of its     |
  | failed clauses (all lists) are retested.     |
  `---------------------------------------------*/
