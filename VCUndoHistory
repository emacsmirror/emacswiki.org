Sometimes when one does a vc-revert and abandons the changes he regrets the action and wants to retrieve the changes. This package helps in that. If you install it then after a vc-revert you can access previous diffs with M-x my-list-revert-history.

    (defvar my-revert-history-length 30)
    
    (defvar my-revert-history nil)
    
    (defadvice vc-diff-internal (after my-vc-diff-internal activate)
      (if (eq this-command 'vc-revert)
          (let ((diff (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max))))
            (push diff my-revert-history)
            (if (> (length my-revert-history) my-revert-history-length)
                (setq my-revert-history
                      (subseq my-revert-history 0 (1- my-revert-history-length)))))))
    
    (defun my-list-revert-history ()
      (interactive)
      (pop-to-buffer "*revert history*")
      (erase-buffer)
      (dolist (i my-revert-history)
        (insert (car (split-string i "\n")))
        (put-text-property (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)
                           'revert-history-item i)
        (insert "\n"))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (local-set-key (kbd "<RET>") 'my-visit-revert-history)
      (local-set-key (kbd "q") 'bury-buffer))
    
    
    (defun my-visit-revert-history ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((diff (get-text-property (line-beginning-position) 'revert-history-item)))
        (when diff
          (pop-to-buffer "*revert history item*")
          (erase-buffer)
          (insert diff)
          (local-set-key (kbd "q") 'bury-buffer)
          (goto-char (point-min)))))
