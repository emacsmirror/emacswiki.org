Many packages exist for reading mail in Emacs.  Even out of the box Emacs
comes with several competing solutions.  These are all well tested and
have a large user base, which certainly is a major advantage if search for
documentation or need help.

Note that several of the mail packages use incompatible mailbox storage
formats.  While there are programs for converting between formats, it is
best you already take your time to consider the supported formats when
choosing your mail client. 

The packages that come with Emacs are:

* [[Rmail]] -- GNU Emacs default mail reader
* [[Gnus]] -- the news and mail reader with likely the largest user base
* [[MH-E]] -- interface to the MH mail system

Some other packages that are distributed separately are also commonly
used:

* WanderLust -- very good IMAP4 and Offline support
* [[Mew]] -- good IMAP4 support
* [[CategoryViewMail|VM]] -- offers virtual folders and good documentation
* NotMuch -- an email indexing/search tool with an emacs mail client
* [[mu4e]] -- new email client based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu e-mail indexer]

Some people also like to use a non-elisp mail client from within Emacs:

* MuttInEmacs

The [[emacs-w3m]] web browser can be used with webmail:

* [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m#toc26 Gmail ]] works well (may require [[https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/EKJfMizvywY  patching]] w3m)

And then there are some less commonly used and/or badly maintained
packages:

* [http://cmail.sourceforge.jp/ CMail] -- is only documented in Japanese
  and hasn't been updated in a long time
* [[imapua]] -- an IMAP mua based on gnus' imap library
* [[http://www1.mirai.ne.jp/~gyo/xyzzy/kamail.html KaMail]] (dead link) -- is only documented in Japanese
* [[http://www.sfu.ca/~sabetts/mailx.el mailx.el]] (dead link) -- a front-end to mailx
* SimpleIMAPClient -- for entertainment purposes only
