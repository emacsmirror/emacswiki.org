== About ==

Cursor-undo allows you to undo cursor movement commands using the Emacs standard `undo' command.                                               
                                                                       
For frequent cursor movements such as up/down/left/right, it combines the movements of the same direction into a single undo entry.  This prevents the undo command from reversing each individual character movement separately.  For example, if you move the cursor 20 characters to the right and then 10 lines up, the first undo will go down 10 lines back, and the next undo move back 20 characters left.  On the other hand, for search commands that often jump across multiple pages, each search command has its own undo entry, allowing you to undo them one at a time rather than as a combined operation.

== "Brief" History ==

This cursor-undo functionality has existed in my local Emacs init file for over 11+ years, since version 0 on 2013-06-26.  It was originally intended to support my BriefMode only, but I later found it would be more useful if implemented in a more generalized way.  For years I have hoped for an official implementation of this feature, which is commonly seen among various editors.  Considering my implementation using advice functions a bit inelegant so I have always hesitated to release it till recently.                                 
                                                                       
Until there is official support for the cursor undo feature, this package serves most common daily needs.  The core design is to align with Emacs's native `undo' function by recording cursor positions and screen-relative position undo entries in the `buffer-undo-list' in accordance with its documentation.

As this package primarily consists of advice functions to wrap cursor movement commands, each cursor movement command needs to be manually wrapped with `def-cursor-undo'.  For interactive functions that heavily invoke advised cursor movement commands, you may even need to advise them with `disable-cursor-tracking' to prevent generating numerous distinct cursor undo entries from a single command.  For user convenience, I have prepared ready `def-cursor-undo' advice sets for standard Emacs cursor movement commands, Brief Editor mode, Viper mode, and EVIL mode.

== Usage ==

This package is released as a standard [https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/cursor-undo.html ELPA package].  Just go to Emacs main menu -> "Options" -> "Manage Emacs Packages" and install it.  Once this package is installed, you only need to enable cursor-undo mode by adding the following line into your Emacs init file .emacs or init.el:

That's all.  You can now move your cursor around and use stand Emacs `undo' (C-_, C-/ or C-x u) to move it back.  Even in read-only buffers you can still undo cursor movements.  This is convenient especially when browsing a huge file.


== Notes for EVIL mode user ==
                                                                       
If you choose to use default Emacs `undo' system, you should be able to use `evil-undo' to undo cursor movements.  If your choice is tree-undo or another undo system, you might need to use Emacs default `undo' (C-_, C-/ or C-x u ...) to undo cursor movements.             


== Notes for Viper mode user ==
                                                                      
The default `viper-undo' is advised to allow cursor-undo.  If you find the advised function not working properly, consider comment out the following source code `(define-advice viper-undo ...' to restore the original `viper-undo' function and use Emacs default `undo' (C-_, C-/ or C-x u ...) to undo cursor movements.
