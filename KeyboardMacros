== Overview ==

Keyboard macros are a powerful Emacs feature. A '''[::keyboard macro]''' is simply a ''recording'' of a sequence of key sequences. A '''[[key sequence]]''' is a series of keyboard keystrokes, mouse actions, or menu actions that is bound to an Emacs command. So, a keyboard macro records a ''sequence of user actions'' that carry out Emacs commands.

Did you note that a "''keyboard''" macro can record nearly any user actions -- ''not'' just ''keyboard'' actions?  Good.

: '''Note:''' Do not confuse mention of a keyboard macro with mention of a Lisp macro. A Lisp macro is similar to a Lisp function (oops -- not that similar), and is defined using ##defmacro##. 

Here is how to ''define'' a keyboard macro:
* `<code>C-x (</code>' or <code><f3></code>-- start defining a keyboard macro
* `<code>C-x )</code>' or <code><f4></code>-- stop defining the keyboard macro

And here is how to ''execute'' a keyboard macro you've defined:
* `C-x e' or <code><f4></code> -- execute the keyboard macro

Here's how to execute the macro 37 times (you use `C-u' to provide the 37):
* `C-u 37 C-x e'

'''Example:'''

You want to add the text "-- foobar was here" at the end of ''each'' of the lines in a file.
# Place the TextCursor at the beginning of the first line.
# `<code>C-x (</code>' to start recording a keyboard macro.
# `C-e' (or `M-x end-of-line') to move the cursor to the end of the line.
# Type "<code>-- foobar was here</code>"
# `C-a' (or `M-x beginning-of-line') to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
# `C-n' (or `M-x next-line') to move the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
# `<code>C-x )</code>' to stop recording the keyboard macro.
# `C-u 0 C-x e' to execute the macro an infinite number of times until the end of the file is reached (See InfiniteArgument).

What's important here is to stop defining the macro at a ''similar position to where you started it'' -- so that you are in a position to execute it again, after it executes. This is a general rule that you will often follow when defining keyboard macros: try to make them executable ''N'' times in a row.

Actually, although it's good to learn this general rule, there is a shortcut for just applying the last-defined keyboard macro to each of the lines of a region:
* `M-x apply-macro-to-region-lines'

Or to be more precise (from the documentation of the command): 

  For each complete line between point and mark, move to the beginning
  of the line, and run the last keyboard macro.

You can name the last-defined keyboard macro, so that you can then execute it by name:
* `M-x name-last-kbd-macro' -- Name the last-defined keyboard macro.

Why do that? One reason is that it lets you have more than one macro defined at the same time. Once you have named this macro, say, `my-macro', you can define another one that does something else. Then, you can execute the second macro using `C-x e' and execute `my-macro' as if it were a standard Emacs command: `M-x my-macro'. If you also name the second macro, then you can define a third one...

Keyboard macros are only defined for your ''current Emacs session''. If you want to be able to reuse a macro in a future session, then save it in your initialization file (##.emacs## or ##_emacs##). Open the file, then insert the macro definition using this command:
* `M-x insert-kbd-macro' -- Insert a named keyboard macro at point. 

If your insert you macro into your [[init file]], you can use `M-x' to execute the named keyboard macro in future
sessions -- just as if it were a standard Emacs command of the same name.  If you want to bind it to a key, you can add code like the
following to your initialization file:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'my-macro)

This binds the key sequence `C-c a' to the macro `my-macro'.

If you want to edit the macro in future sessions, you need to let the ##kmacro## library know that the symbol is indeed a macro by putting the ##kmacro## property on the symbol.

  (put 'my-macro 'kmacro t)

== Problems with Isearch ==

[[Isearch]] is a critical component to recording macros:  Search to the a location in the buffer and perform a command, and the macro can be accurately repeated.  Unfortunately, macros that use Isearch to bring you to a location exhibit the behavior of skipping to the next occurrence and then halting rather than staying in `isearch-mode'.  This was reported as a bug [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2005-10/msg00534.html], but is unfortunately not a bug [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2005-11/msg00021.html].

== Calling a Keyboard Macro from Emacs Lisp ==

When you use `name-last-kbd-macro', the string that defines the keyboard macro becomes the function definition of the macro name you provide. You cannot call such a macro by name in Emacs Lisp as if it were a function. For example, if you named the keyboard macro "foo", then you cannot simply write ##(foo)## in Lisp to execute the macro. Instead, you must use the function `execute-kbd-macro' as follows:

    (execute-kbd-macro (symbol-function 'foo))

(Function `symbol-function' returns the function definition of its symbol argument. In this case, it returns the string that defines the keyboard macro `foo'.)

== Querying the User During Keyboard Macro Execution ==

You can use `C-x q' (command `kbd-macro-query') to make Emacs pause and query the user at a certain point during keyboard macro execution.

{{{
C-x q runs the command kbd-macro-query
   which is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `macros'.
[Arg list not available until function definition is loaded.]

Query user during kbd macro execution.
  With prefix argument, enters recursive edit, reading keyboard
commands even within a kbd macro.  You can give different commands
each time the macro executes.
  Without prefix argument, asks whether to continue running the macro.
Your options are:
Y       Finish this iteration normally and continue with the next.
N       Skip the rest of this iteration, and start the next.
RET     Stop the macro entirely right now.
C-l     Redisplay the screen, then ask again.
C-r     Enter recursive edit; ask again when you exit from that.
}}}

== Prompting During Keyboard Macro Execution ==

Using `C-u C-x q' while recording a macro will, at macro execution, drop in to a recursive editing mode allowing you to intervene with custom editing on each macro iteration.

You can also use the following piece of code to prompt for input using the
MiniBuffer each time the macro executes.

Pressing `C-x Q' during macro definition will present you with a
minibuffer prompt (using recursive edit). Inserting some text and
pressing RET will end recursive edit and continue the definition of
the macro in the minibuffer. Pressing RET again will insert the
entered text at point. If you don't want to insert the text right away you can instead kill the input at this point (using `C-a C-k RET') and use it later in the macro definition.

    (defun my-macro-query (arg)
      "Prompt for input using minibuffer during kbd macro execution.
    With prefix argument, allows you to select what prompt string to use.
    If the input is non-empty, it is inserted at point."
      (interactive "P")
      (let* ((query (lambda () (kbd-macro-query t)))
             (prompt (if arg (read-from-minibuffer "PROMPT: ") "Input: "))
             (input (unwind-protect
                        (progn
                          (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook query)
                          (read-from-minibuffer prompt))
                      (remove-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook query))))
        (unless (string= "" input) (insert input))))

    (global-set-key "\C-xQ" 'my-macro-query)

In Emacs 22 we can use a shorter definition:

      (let* ((prompt (if arg (read-from-minibuffer "PROMPT: ") "Input: "))
             (input (minibuffer-with-setup-hook (lambda () (kbd-macro-query t))
                      (read-from-minibuffer prompt))))
        (unless (string= "" input) (insert input)))


== One-Key Macros ==

One may wish to bind the following code to a function key, like this:

    (global-set-key '[(f1)]          'call-last-kbd-macro)
    (global-set-key '[(shift f1)]    'toggle-kbd-macro-recording-on)

It is much faster to use than the original bindings.

The toggling function(s):

<pre>
    (defun toggle-kbd-macro-recording-on ()
      "One-key keyboard macros: turn recording on."
      (interactive)
      (define-key global-map (this-command-keys)
        'toggle-kbd-macro-recording-off)
      (start-kbd-macro nil))

    (defun toggle-kbd-macro-recording-off ()
      "One-key keyboard macros: turn recording off."
      (interactive)
      (define-key global-map (this-command-keys)
        'toggle-kbd-macro-recording-on)
      (end-kbd-macro))
</pre>

== Part of GnuEmacs ==

: ;;; kmacro.el --- enhanced keyboard macros
: ;;; edmacro.el --- keyboard macro editor

== External Packages ==

While the kmacro package provides excellent support for dealing with keyboard
macros that have been defined and named during the current Emacs
session, support for saving, organizing, and reloading keyboard
macros remains a bit on the weak side. The 
[http://thbecker.net/free_software_utilities/emacs_lisp/emacros/start_page.html Emacros]
package facilitates these tasks.
