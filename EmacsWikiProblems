== Revisioning Problems ==

[:EditingGetsOldPageText]
=== editing does not get most recent version ===

I tried yet again to get emacs-w3m to work as described above.  I edited.  It didn't work.  I edited the page with Safari.  It worked.  Then I followed the instructions again in emacs-w3m.  The Safari edit did not show up in the compose edit box, even though the page did show it.  Therefore, the text that the user edits is not the same as the text that is shown.  Is this a cache issue?  Thanks.

I don't think I've ever run into this. Anybody else? -- AlexSchroeder

=== RecentChanges doesn't reflect recent changes ===

I just edited and saved a reply someone posted at DrewsElispLibraries. I refrefreshed RecentChanges (with rollbacks and minor changes included), but my edit does not appear. That wiki page is listed, but still at the time and user of the previous edit. However, after clicking List only major changes it was listed. I had previously cleared my cache, so I don't think that was the problem. I'm guessing it was a cache problem nevertheless, but thought I'd mention it, in case it's not. -- DrewAdams











== Markup/Generation Issues==


=== Can markup be used in headers? <code>I have failed to do so.</code> ===
Is this documented somewhere?

Use-case: putting a category-tag like <code>CategoryNeedsAttention</code> into a header, without actually invoking it.

Interestingly, the markup in this particular header renders properly in the TOC

Markup cannot be nested by default. Very few markup elements can in fact be nested. This is not documented anywhere, I think.
Common sense stuff like list items and inline markup can be nested (bold list items, for example).
Emphasis markup using apostrophes is the only inline markup that can be nested: ##''italic '''bold''' and italic''## -> ''italic '''bold''' and italic''. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
The irony being that markup in headers **is** rendered in the (javascript-built) TOC -- MichaelPaulukonis



=== Apostrophes etc. not prettified in links ==

* ##ain't -- it -- "nice"## => ain't -- it -- "nice"
* ##[EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]## => [EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]

The link text retains its crude ASCII formatting. -- VegardOye

Yes, there is no recursive parsing of the link text.

== General Issues ==

=== thingatpoint+.el empty apart from comments ===
[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/thingatpt%2b.el thingatpt+.el] is empty apart from comments. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it did throw an error on Emacs startup after I updated my EmacsWiki packages.

It seems to have been a problem with the upload. I should have double-checked that it uploaded OK. Looks OK now, so I'm deleting this problem entry. Thanks for reporting it.


=== MeatBall links lead to a spam site now. ===

It looks like usemod dot com domain has expired. Some of the MeatBall links now end up on spam sites eg: AppropriateMedia
