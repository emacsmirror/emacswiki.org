== RSS for ElispArea == 

[new]

Ran across this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2005-04-27 , which is showing an `XML::RSS is not available on this system.` error.  

*Does* the ElispArea have a feed?  

I did try to use ##?action=rss&rcidonly=EmacsLisp&all=1&days=28## (from https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Including_RSS_Feeds) but the response says per page feeds aren't available. 

[new]
Yeah, I stopped doing the feed integration part because I think these days people all keep their own feed readers or they don't care about feeds. Either way, there's no need to use the wiki as a "portal" to the web.

The GET method for the RSS action (##?action=rss&rcidonly=EmacsLisp&all=1&days=28##) is not supported because of all the web and feed scraping that's going on. It would still work using a POST request but feed readers don't support it, so it's /de facto/ unusable. However, if you have a HTML page with a form, then you can /submit/ a query that produces the desired result.

I worked something up on [[Changes to elisp libraries]]. -- [[Alex Schroeder]]

== Markup/Generation Issues==

=== Can markup be used in headers? <code>I have failed to do so.</code> ===
Is this documented somewhere?

Use-case: putting a category-tag like <code>CategoryNeedsAttention</code> into a header, without actually invoking it.

Interestingly, the markup in this particular header renders properly in the TOC

[new]
Markup cannot be nested by default. Very few markup elements can in fact be nested. This is not documented anywhere, I think.
Common sense stuff like list items and inline markup can be nested (bold list items, for example).
Emphasis markup using apostrophes is the only inline markup that can be nested: ##''italic '''bold''' and italic''## -> ''italic '''bold''' and italic''. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
The irony being that markup in headers **is** rendered in the (javascript-built) TOC -- MichaelPaulukonis

=== Apostrophes etc. not prettified in links ==

* ##ain't -- it -- "nice"## => ain't -- it -- "nice"
* ##[EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]## => [EmacsWikiProblems ain't -- it -- "nice"]

The link text retains its crude ASCII formatting. -- VegardOye

[new]
Yes, there is no recursive parsing of the link text.

== General Issues ==

=== MeatBall links lead to a spam site now. ===

It looks like usemod dot com domain has expired. Some of the MeatBall links now end up on spam sites eg: AppropriateMedia

=== Many pages missing from Google search results ===

At least until fairly recently, most pages used to show up in Google search results in a reasonable way, often in a general search, certainly if using "site:www.emacswiki.org".  For me today (2025-03-02), that no longer happens; it seems like some pages are searchable but most are not.
* https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aemacswiki.org+Orgmode returns only a CategoryHumor page
* https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=site%3Aemacswiki.org+Orgmode returns reasonable results
* https://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Aemacswiki.org+Orgmode returns reasonable results

Google have some useful-looking advice on diagnostics for site admins [https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289?hl=en here].
