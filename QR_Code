You can use QR codes to transfer strings such as passwords to your phone using the camera.
The code below uses the [https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en qrencode] command-line tool.

{{{
(defun qr-code-region (start end)
  "Show a QR code of the region.
A simple way to transfer text to the phone..."
  (interactive "r")
  (let ((buf (get-buffer-create "*QR*"))
	(inhibit-read-only t))
    (with-current-buffer buf
      (erase-buffer))
    (let ((coding-system-for-read 'raw-text))
      (shell-command-on-region start end "qrencode -o -" buf))
    (switch-to-buffer buf)
    (image-mode)))
}}}
