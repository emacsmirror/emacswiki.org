An Emacs buffer must be in exactly one [[major mode]]. It might also be in one or more '''[::minor mode]s''' that provide additional functionality.

A minor mode is often appropriate for use with more than one major mode. It sometimes adds functionality that is orthogonal to that provided by the major mode. For example, font-lock (minor) mode provides syntax-sensitive highlighting; it can be used with most major modes to provide appropriate highlighting (see EnablingFontLock).

Most minor modes have a command that turns them on and off. For example:

* `delete-selection-mode' -- see DeleteSelectionMode
* `auto-fill-mode' -- see AutoFillMode
* `font-lock-mode' -- see EnablingFontLock
* `line-number-mode' -- see LineNumbers

== Defining minor modes ==

The easiest way to define a minor mode is with the ##define-minor-mode## macro from ##easy-mmode.el##.

== Discussion ==

How do I check whether a given minor mode is active?

Test the value of the mode variable. Example: ##(if delete-selection-mode ...)##

But some minor modes don't have a variable, e.g., auto-fill-mode. -- [[rubikitch]]

True. I was going to say "File a bug", but checking the code defining `auto-fill-mode' I see this comment:

<pre>
(put 'auto-fill-function :minor-mode-function 'auto-fill-mode)
;; FIXME: turn into a proper minor mode.
;; Add a global minor mode version of it.
(defun auto-fill-mode (&optional arg)
...
</pre>
So I guess the answer is: (1) file a bug, (2) volunteer to fix the code. ;-) -- DrewAdams

I filed a bug: [http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=2470|#2470]. -- DrewAdams
