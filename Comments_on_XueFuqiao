''%%FuQiao%%:'' Now that you've corrected the spelling of %%XinJiang%%, I know where that is!  I did some traveling there back in 1988 --- no doubt long before you were born there!  A 3.5-day train ride from Beijing to [[WikiPedia:Urumqi|Urumqi]] (aka Wulumuqi) followed by a 3.5-day bus ride to [[WikiPedia:Kashgar|Kashgar]] (aka Kashi), then back again.  A great trip that I will always remember.  The long hard-sleeper ride was a highlight, believe it or not.

FYI -- You don't need to wrap a `lambda' form in either `function' or `cl-function'.  Just the `lambda' form is enough, and is every bit as efficient (in EmacsLisp).

But if you need to use `lambda' with a Common-Lisp parameter list (not so, in the case I saw), then `cl-function' is needed (unless you load cl at runtime).  HTH.
