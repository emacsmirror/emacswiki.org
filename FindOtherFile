GNU Emacs has a built-in capability for finding 'other' files from the current buffer. These are intended to be related files such as C/C++ header files. This capability was added some time in 2002, and so should be more or less universally available by now. 

The command to invoke is <code>ff-find-other-file</code>, which is also available under the possibly more descriptive alias <code>ff-find-related-file</code>. In addition there is a <code>ff-get-other-file</code> command which disables detection of include files (see below). No keys are bound by default, but can obviously be added, see CategoryKeys.

There are many options which can be set to customize the way in which the other files are located. The docstring describes them as follows:

{{{
ff-find-other-file is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in `find-file.el'.

(ff-find-other-file &optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW IGNORE-INCLUDE)

Find the header or source file corresponding to this file.
Being on a `#include' line pulls in that file.

If optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, find the file in the other window.
If optional IGNORE-INCLUDE is non-nil, ignore being on `#include' lines.

Variables of interest include:

 - `ff-case-fold-search'
   Non-nil means ignore cases in matches (see `case-fold-search').
   If you have extensions in different cases, you will want this to be nil.

 - `ff-always-in-other-window'
   If non-nil, always open the other file in another window, unless an
   argument is given to `ff-find-other-file'.

 - `ff-ignore-include'
   If non-nil, ignores #include lines.

 - `ff-always-try-to-create'
   If non-nil, always attempt to create the other file if it was not found.

 - `ff-quiet-mode'
   If non-nil, traces which directories are being searched.

 - `ff-special-constructs'
   A list of regular expressions specifying how to recognize special
   constructs such as include files etc, and an associated method for
   extracting the filename from that construct.

 - `ff-other-file-alist'
   Alist of extensions to find given the current file's extension.

 - `ff-search-directories'
   List of directories searched through with each extension specified in
   `ff-other-file-alist' that matches this file's extension.

 - `ff-pre-find-hook'
   List of functions to be called before the search for the file starts.

 - `ff-pre-load-hook'
   List of functions to be called before the other file is loaded.

 - `ff-post-load-hook'
   List of functions to be called after the other file is loaded.

 - `ff-not-found-hook'
   List of functions to be called if the other file could not be found.

 - `ff-file-created-hook'
   List of functions to be called if the other file has been created.

== Example Init ==

For example, the following InitFile code would be suitable for setting up C/C++ header file switching using <code>M-o</code>

{{{
(defvar my-cpp-other-file-alist
  '(("\\.cpp\\'" (".hpp" ".ipp"))
    ("\\.ipp\\'" (".hpp" ".cpp"))
    ("\\.hpp\\'" (".ipp" ".cpp"))
    ("\\.cxx\\'" (".hxx" ".ixx"))
    ("\\.ixx\\'" (".cxx" ".hxx"))
    ("\\.hxx\\'" (".ixx" ".cxx"))
    ("\\.c\\'" (".h"))
    ("\\.h\\'" (".c"))
    ))

(setq-default ff-other-file-alist 'my-cpp-other-file-alist)

(add-hook 'c-initialization-hook (lambda ()
    (define-key c-mode-base-map [(meta o)] 'ft-get-other-file))
)
}}}

== Limitations ==

Generally there is little point setting up more than one 'other' file for any given file. This is because <code>ff-find-other-file</code> always prefers to switch to an existing buffer over a unvisited file. This generally means that invoking the command two times will take you back to the original buffer, and not (say) a third, unvisited file.
