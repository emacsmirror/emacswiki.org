This page is about the [https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/minimap.html minimap] package, an Emacs implementation of [http://www.sublimetext.com/ Sublime Text]'s "minimap". 

It shows a "minibar" with a small-scale display of the current buffer alongside the main editing window. This highlights the portion of the buffer that is currently visible in the main window. You can scroll the main window by dragging the highlighted area in the minibar.

==Installation==
It is in GNU ELPA as [https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/minimap.html minimap], so you can get it directly from `M-x package-install', or you can find its code at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/elpa.git/tree/packages/minimap/minimap.el

Repository at GitHub: https://github.com/dengste/minimap

==Usage==
* Use `M-x minimap-mode' to toggle the minimap minor mode. By default, the Minimap will automatically be activated for all buffers which are derived from `prog-mode'.
* Use `M-x customize-group RET minimap RET' to adapt minimap to your needs.

==Customization==
* Recenter strategies - always keep active region in the middle, or scroll dependent on the position in the buffer.
* Can use information from CEDET's semantic analyzer to display structure, functions, variables and types.
* Alternatively, can display certain faces in their normal size so that you can still read them (function names, for instance).
* Position on the left or right.
* Set minimap-update-delay to 0 if you want an immediate reaction to scrolling (slows down scrolling, though).

==Screenshots==

==Known bugs==
* Currently cannot deal with images.
* Display/movement can be a bit erratic at times.
==TODO==
* Fix known bugs.
* Make sidebar permanently visible. This requires something like a
   'window group' feature in Emacs, which is currently being worked on (for the EmacsCodeBrowser).
* Moving the active region with the keyboard / mouse-wheel ?
* Somehow make the minimap more compact -- maybe the line spacing can still be reduced? For now, you can choose another, more condensed fonts.
