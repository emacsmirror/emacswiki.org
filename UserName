== If you just want to read ==

If you expect that your visits here will be only for reading, welcome!

== If you want to edit pages ==

You can edit pages without any further ado. You're not required to
"register" anywhere. If you want, you can set a '''username''' for
yourself.  It is entirely up to you.  Your username is not "secure."
Anybody can use the same name as you do.  We believe in
MeatBall:SoftSecurity.

On the edit page, you will find a field for your username.  The username
should be a word in
'''<nowiki>CamelCase</nowiki>''' -- mixed case, no spaces.  Just use
your first and last name smashed together, eg. AlexSchroeder.  If you
have a nickname that you often use on [[IRC]] or elsewhere online,
you can put it on your page using square brackets and two colons like
this: ##[::kensanata]##. Then you'll be able to link to your page using
either name -- both AlexSchroeder and [[kensanata]] will work.

The username will be used to tag any edits you make on RecentChanges.
Note that even if you do have a username, your IP or hostname will be
logged -- and be visible to others.  If you want to keep it a secret,
you need to use a network anonymizer like TheOnionRouter (Tor).

Cookies are specific to the machine and browser you are using, thus
the cookie will be lost as soon as you use another browser or as soon
as you connect from another machine.

If you don't want to provide a username, use [[Anonymous]].

You might want to add your username to CategoryHomepage.

== If you want Bling ==

You might want a button to put on your blog or other website.

See EmacsWikiBling.

== Cookie Problems ==

It seems that some people lose their cookies.  It certainly ''works for me''.
So at the moment I suspect that this is related to the browser being used.
If you experience this problem, please indicate browser version and OS version
down below.  Perhaps we can narrow it down.  Other problem solving ideas
appreciated.  ;)
