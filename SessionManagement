"Session Management" is the act of saving some of what you are doing  and restoring it later. Often your current state is saved when you quit
Emacs and restored when you start a new session.

* [https://github.com/m0smith/annals Annals] -- Associate [[DeskTops]]s with tasks including Jira and Github.  Think Mylyn.
* [[BookmarkPlus|Bookmark+]] -- [[DeskTop]]s as bookmarks: just hit a
  key to create them or jump among them.
* DeskTop -- Save and restore open [[buffer]]s, [[point]], [[mark]],
  histories, other [[variable]]s.
* [[http://desktopaid.sourceforge.net/ DesktopAid]] -- Save and
  restore [[frame]]s.
* DesktopMenu -- DeskTop extension that lets you manage multiple
  desktops, possibly in a single directory.
* MkDesktop -- For use with DesktopMenu. Automates the creation of
  multiple, named desktops from generated lists of files.
* EmacsSession, ##session.el## -- Save global variables,
  [[register]]s, and buffer positions; does not reload visited files
  like DeskTop does.
* FrameRestorePackage -- Save and restore frame configurations.
* [[MinimalSessionSaver]] -- Saves and restores list of visited files
* [http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/emacs-named-desktop-sessions.html my-desktop] -- Named desktop sessions.
* [[nameses]] -- Named desktop sessions, based on my-desktop.

  Part of TinyTools.
* [[WThreeMSession]] -- Manage W3M sessions.
* WcyDesktop -- Like DeskTop, but faster loading.

I tried *desktopaid* at April 2013 in 23.1.1. I downloaded the package from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/desktopaid/ source page]. The package has desktopaid.elc but it's compiled for older version of emacs so it wont work. Trying with desktopaid.el emacs opened with no error. So i changed a little the proposed .emacs lines and i added:
<pre>
;; desktopaid
(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/" load-path))
(autoload 'dta-hook-up "desktopaid.el" "Desktop Aid" t)
(dta-hook-up)
</pre>
*In short: Across sessions -- Frames: OK,  Windows:No , Directories:No* 
What you should pay attention to :
Starting first time emacs with desktopaid enabled we will be asked 'Select configuration:' If we proceed with just an Enter, then in trying to close emacs will error that there is no .desktopaid dir.  So create the ~/.desktopaid dir first and give a name of the configuration file when asked at the start.
Generally i wouldnt recommended for new emacs users since it seems not-maintained and tricky to set-up correctly. Unless ofcourse the functionality is needed.

I use EmacsSession, because it doesn't reload all the files and doesn't require a lot of customization like DeskTop does. -- AlexSchroeder

I'm wondering: what would it take to have Emacs checkpoint all of its state entirely to disk (dumping the process and its memory)?  Would the architecture allow for this on certain platforms?  I wonder in particular because of the way in which Emacs can build itself by dumping core.  I'm wondering about the potential for a high-fidelity suspend and resume.
