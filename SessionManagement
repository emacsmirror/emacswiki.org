"Session Management" is the act of saving some of what you are doing  and restoring it later. Often your current state is saved when you quit
Emacs and restored when you start a new session.

[new]
I tried desktopaid at April 2013 in 23.1.1. I downloaded the package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/desktopaid/. The package has desktopaid.elc but is compiled for older version of emacs so it wont work. Trying with desktopaid.el emacs opened with no error but i couldnt use it. Firstly i was getting an error about a missing .desktopaid folder, but even after it didnt work as expected.--


I use EmacsSession, because it doesn't reload all the files and doesn't require a lot of customization like DeskTop does. -- AlexSchroeder
