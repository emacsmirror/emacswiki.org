"Session Management" is the act of saving some of what you are doing  and restoring it later. Often your current state is saved when you quit
Emacs and restored when you start a new session.

== List of Session Management packages for Emacs ==

* [https://github.com/jamescherti/easysession.el easysession]: A session manager for Emacs that can persist and restore file editing buffers, indirect buffers/clones, Dired buffers, windows/splits, the built-in tab-bar (including tabs, their buffers, and windows), and Emacs frames. It offers a convenient and effortless way to manage Emacs editing sessions and utilizes built-in Emacs functions to persist and restore frames.
