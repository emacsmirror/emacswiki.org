This page is about commenting parts of code.

Each code language has its own comment string for commenting-out code.
In Emacs lisp, for example, it is <code>;</code>. Some languages have
different comment strings for comment start and end. These are the
values of mode-specific variables <code>comment-start</code> and
<code>comment-end</code>. For example, in C,
<code>comment-start</code> is <code>/*</code> and
<code>comment-end</code> is <code>*/</code>. 

The main command for commenting or uncommenting each of the lines in a
region is <code>comment-region</code>. With prefix argument, this
command adds that many comment strings. So, in Emacs lisp code, where
the comment string is <code>;</code>:
* <code>comment-region</code> adds a single <code>;</code>.
* `C-u' ''N'' `M-x comment-region', where ''N'' is an integer, adds or
removes ''N'' <code>;</code>. For example:
** `C-u 3 M-x comment-region' adds <code>;;;</code>.
** `C-u -2 M-x comment-region' removes <code>;;</code>. (As always,
`M-' ''N'' is a shortcut for `C-u' ''N'' when ''N'' is negative.)
* `C-u M-x comment-region' uncomments the region, no matter how many
<code>;</code> are used for the comments.

If you want to bind uncommenting to a key, you can use this
(equivalent to `C-u M-x comment-region):

      (defun uncomment-region (beg end)
        "Like `comment-region' invoked with a C-u prefix arg."
        (interactive "r")
        (comment-region beg end -1))

I bind `<code>C-x C-;</code>' to `comment-region'. Very handy. (And
that key sequence is normally unbound.) -- DrewAdams

For end-of-line comments (after existing code), use command
<code>indent-for-comment</code>, which is usually bound to `M-;'. You
can set the column that the comment string is placed in with command
<code>set-comment-column</code>.

In some versions of Emacs, there is command <code>comment-dwim</code>,
which combines <code>comment-region</code> and
<code>indent-for-comment</code> to always DoWhatIMean. In those
versions, it is usually bound to `M-;' (replacing
<code>indent-for-comment</code>).

Also very useful is `comment-or-uncomment-region', present in newer
versions of Emacs.

I am addicted to the M-; ##comment-dwim## command. However I wanted to
change the default behaviour a bit. If no region is selected,
comment-dwim inserts comment at the end of the line. Instead, I wanted to comment out
whole line, if we are currently not at the end of the line. This does the trick:

      ;; Original idea from
      ;; http://www.opensubscriber.com/message/emacs-devel@gnu.org/10971693.html
      (defun comment-dwim-line (&optional arg)
        "Replacement for the comment-dwim command.
        If no region is selected and current line is not blank and we are not at the end of the line,
        then comment current line.
        Replaces default behaviour of comment-dwim, when it inserts comment at the end of the line."
          (interactive "*P")
          (comment-normalize-vars)
          (if (and (not (region-active-p)) (not (looking-at "[ \t]*$")))
              (comment-or-uncomment-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))
            (comment-dwim arg)))

      (global-set-key "\M-;" 'comment-dwim-line)

The above version requires the region to start at the beginning of a line - this version corrects that.

    (defun comment-eclipse ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((start (line-beginning-position))
            (end (line-end-position)))
        (when (region-active-p)
          (setq start (save-excursion
                        (goto-char (region-beginning))
                        (beginning-of-line)
                        (point))
                end (save-excursion
                      (goto-char (region-end))
                      (end-of-line)
                      (point))))
        (comment-or-uncomment-region start end)))

* Anyone know how to change the behavior of comment-region so that it
will comment empty lines?  I use it to cite text in emails and I
dislike the way recent versions of newcomment fail to comment the
blank lines. --JoeE (Originally posted on WishList)
** Look at the variable comment-empty-lines. --StefanReichoer

* Is there a command for moving to the end of the current comment, assuming
point is in a comment? --SueDNymme
