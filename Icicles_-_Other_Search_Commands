== Other Icicles Search Commands ==

Function `icicle-search' is very general.  As is explained in
[[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]], [[command]] `icicle-occur' is defined trivially
using `icicle-search' -- it is basically `icicle-search' with a
[[regexp]] of `##.*##', to match entire [[line]]s.  Similarly,
`icicle-search-word' (`##C-c $##') uses a regexp of '''`##\b##''' ''##WORD##'' '''##\b##'''', where
`''##WORD##'' ' is the word to look for, and `icicle-search-keywords'
(`##C-c ^##') uses a regexp of '''`##\(##''' ''##KW1##'' '''##\|##''' ''##KW2##'' '''##\|##''' ''##KW2##'' ...'''##\|##''' ''##KWn##'' '''##\)##'''', where the
''`KWm''' are the keywords (regexps) to look for.

Still other '''Icicles''' commands are available that make use
of `icicle-search'.  And you can define your own, specialized
search commands along the same lines.  To do that, it is instructive to look at
the source code of the commands described in this section; they
can serve as a model for defining your own search commands.

Two of the commands described here, `icicle-compilation-search' and `icicle-comint-search', are specialized versions of `icicle-search' that work only in particular [[buffer]]s where there is little need for `icicle-search' itself. For this reason, these commands reuse the [[key sequence]], '''`[tt]C-c `'[tt]''' (backquote), that is normally bound to `icicle-search'.  This shadow binding occurs
if the current [[major mode]] is a compilation mode (for `icicle-compilation-search') or an
interactive interpreter mode such as `shell-mode' or Lisp interactive mode (for `icicle-comint-search').

: ['''Programmer Note:''' Actually, the way this works is that '''`[tt]C-c `'[tt]'''  and `M-s M-s M-s' are bound to `icicle-search-generic', which calls the command that is the value of internal [[variable]] `icicle-search-command'.
You can use this mechanism to provide custom '''Icicles''' search
commands for particular buffers.]

Besides the commands described on this page, there are '''Icicles'''
search commands for navigating TagsFile definitions and searching
their associated source files.  These are described in section
[[Icicles - Emacs Tags Enhancements]].

If you use '''`M-g'''' in the [[minibuffer]] to toggle option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]]</tt>'''', then you can use just `next'
instead of `C-next' to navigate when using any '''Icicles''' search
command.  See [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]].









[:SearchingTextProperties]
=== Searching Text with Properties ===

Instead of providing a [[context regexp]], for commands
'''`icicle-search-char-property'''',
'''`icicle-search-overlay-property'''', and
'''`icicle-search-text-property'''' ('''[tt]`C-c "'[/tt]''') you provide a [[text property|text]] or [[overlay]] property (e.g. `face') and its value (e.g. `font-lock-function-name-face').
All zones of text that have that property with that value become
the [[completion]] candidates (search hits).  As always, you can
filter this set of candidates by typing input in the minibuffer.

[tt]‘icicle-search-[b][i]char[/i][/b]-property’[/tt]  searches  either or both kinds of property: text or overlay; [tt]‘icicle-search-[b][i]overlay[/i][/b]-property’[/tt] searches only overlay
properties; [tt]‘icicle-search-[b][i]text[/i][/b]-property’[/tt] (`##C-c "##') searches only text
properties.  

For example, if you use `icicle-search-char-property' with a `face' property
value `highlight', then the text searched includes text with that
overlay value and text with that text-property value.  With a `face' property value of `font-lock-string-face', you can
browse or search doc strings, and so on.

If the property chosen is `face', then you can in fact choose
multiple [[face]]s, in [[multi-command]] fashion (e.g. `C-mouse-2'), and the text that is
searched has at least one of the faces you choose.  If you choose
no face value (empty input), then the target is text that has any
face at all.  The search hits are zones of text that are
distinguished by their `face' values.

As with other '''Icicles''' search commands, a [[prefix argument]] controls
whether these property-searching commands search the current
[[buffer]], selected [[bookmark]]s, selected files, or selected buffers.
However, keep in mind that, since in this case you are searching
text or overlay properties, you will find search hits only for buffers
that already have such properties, for example, buffers that have
been fontified.








[:IciclesImenu]
=== Icicles Imenu: `icicle-imenu' ===

Command '''`icicle-imenu'''', which is bound to '''`##C-c =##'''', is an ''[[ImenuMode|Imenu]] browser''.  It lets you use '''Icicles''' completion to navigate among or
search the content of definitions of functions, [[variable]]s, [[macro]]s, [[key]]s, and so on in a programming language (any language that Imenu handles).  As always in '''Icicles''', your current input (e.g. a regexp) filters the set of available candidates.  That is, you can match against ''parts'' of an Imenu entry -- any parts. That's particularly useful if there are many entries in the Imenu menu; you do not need to read/scan the whole list.

Here's a screenshot of using `icicle-imenu' to find function definitions (Imenu submenu '''Functions''') that match the regexp `kill':

[[image:IciclesImenuScreenshot]]

If you look at the definition of `icicle-imenu' you'll see that it
simply lets you choose an Imenu submenu ('''Functions''', '''Options''', and so on) that is appropriate for the
current buffer type, and then it calls `icicle-search', passing it the appropriate Imenu regexp.

You can similarly define your own specialized search commands 
using `icicle-search' to browse regexp matches. You get all of the features of `icicle-search' when you do that. For example, `icicle-imenu' gives you these advantages over a standard Imenu menu:

* You can restrict navigation (search) to a [[region]].
* You can navigate (browse) among multiple entries, instead of choosing them one by one from a menu.
* You can restrict the entries to browse using (regexp) pattern matching.
* As for `icicle-search', you can search multiple bookmarks, multiple buffers, or multiple files.    

When you use an '''Icicles''' Imenu command, first you choose a submenu
for a given object type (e.g. submenu '''Functions''' for functions),
and then you choose an object definition from that submenu.  But
multiple [[regexp]]s can be used for a given Imenu submenu, such as
'''Function'''.  '''Icicles''' Imenu commands use these regexps separately,
so they present multiple completion candidates with the same name
when you choose the object type.

For example, if two different regexps are used to gather function
definitions then there might be two corresponding '''Functions'''
candidates (depending on whether there are matches for each of the
regexps).  Choosing one or the other of these submenu candidates then gives
you different function choices.  (Remember that you can cycle to
choose among multiple candidates that have the same name.)









==== Type-Specific Imenu Commands ====

In addition, '''Icicles''' provides specializations of `icicle-imenu' to find only definitions of particular types:

* '''`icicle-imenu-command'''' -- Emacs [[command]]s
* '''`icicle-imenu-face'''' -- Emacs [[face]]s
* '''`icicle-imenu-key-explicit-map'''' -- Emacs [[key]]s in explicit maps
* '''`icicle-imenu-key-implicit-map'''' -- Emacs [[key]]s in implicit maps (e.g. `global-set-key')
* '''`icicle-imenu-macro'''' -- Lisp [[macro]]s
* '''`icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function'''' -- Lisp non-[[command]] functions
* '''`icicle-imenu-user-option'''' -- Emacs [[user option]]s
* '''`icicle-imenu-variable'''' -- Lisp non-option [[variable]]s

All of these commands use only the [[ImenuMode|Imenu]] [[regexp]]s that match
entities of different types.  Because these regexps were designed
(for Imenu) only to ''locate the start'' of a definition, they
generally do not match full definitions.  This makes them OK for
use by an '''Icicles''' multi-command as a browser, to navigate among
definitions.  But it does not make them useful for searching the
content of definitions.










[:ImenuFullDefinitions]
==== Imenu Commands that Search Full Definitions====

'''Icicles''' also provides a similar set of commands, with the same
names but with suffix '''`-full'''', which do use full definitions as
the completion candidates, so you can search those bodies.  When
you only want to navigate, you will generally use the non `-full'
commands because the candidates are simpler.  When you want to
search you will generally use the `-full' commands.

Be aware that "full" really means what it says only for 
definitions in languages like Lisp.  These commands in fact first match the Imenu [[regexp]],
then use the text between the regexp match beginning and one [[sexp]]
forward.  In the case of Lisp sexps, that means they use the full sexp for
the definition.  But in the case of other languages, such as C,
the "full" definitions can in fact be shorter than the simple
regexp matches.







==== Icicles Imenu Combines Benefits of Imenu and Emacs Tags ====

* [[ImenuMode|Imenu]] lets you navigate among definitions in a single buffer.
* EmacsTags let you navigate among definitions in multiple files, but you must build and update the TagsFile that identifies the definitions.

Like Emacs [[tags]], '''Icicles''' Imenu commands let you navigate among definitions in multiple files -- and also multiple bookmarks and multiple non-file buffers. Like Imenu, you need not build a tags file.  Unlike Imenu, '''Icicles''' provides regexp completion that lets you filter Imenu hits that you want to visit.

Another difference from Emacs tags, besides the need for a tags file, is that, since '''Icicles''' locates definitions using Imenu regexps, you can only navigate among definitions in buffers that you are visiting. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage: you can narrow the search to certain files, but you must know which files to search. And if you want to search all files, then you must open them all (e.g. by matching a project regexp), 

The differences mean that '''Icicles''' Imenu commands do not provide a substitute for Emacs tags; they provide some similar functionality. They add another tool to your tool belt, handier in some situations than using tags, and less useful in some other situations.

[:SearchingThingAtPointThings]
=== Searching Thing-At-Point Things ===

Command '''`icicle-search-thing'''' lets you search the content of
buffer zones whose text represents things of a particular kind:
`[[sexp]]', `defun', `<tt>[[Sentences|sentence]]</tt>', `<tt>[[Paragraphs|paragraph]]</tt>', and so on.

Library [[ThingAtPoint+]] provides many enhancements and some bug
fixes for the basic `thing-at-point' functionality provided by
vanilla library ##thingatpt.el##.  I strongly recommend that you use
it if you use command `icicle-search-thing'.


Be aware that the thing-at-point functions have as their main
purpose to let you retrieve a textual thing at point.  In many
cases they rely on `forward-THING' functions that do not move past
the thing if point is already inside it.

One result of this is that in some cases the thing returned is
composed only of whitespace.  That can sometimes be what you want:
whitespace text is non-empty text.  But in other cases you are not
interested in whitespace-only targets.  (This is not specific to
'''Icicles''' search.)

'''Quiz:''' How would you remove whitespace-only completion candidates?
By matching them and then [[Icicles - Nutshell View#ChippingAway|complementing]] that match.  A regexp such
as this matches most of them: '''##\` \n\t]\'##'''.   (You could also include ##\r##, ##\f##, and
##\v##.)  To get that you would hit these keys:

    \ ` [ SPC C-q C-j C-q TAB ] + \ '

Then, to match the whitespace-only candidates and remove them
you would hit `##S-TAB C-~ S-TAB##'.

(Be aware, BTW, that character class ##[:space:]## does not match
newline or carriage-return characters in some common Emacs modes.
For example, in Emacs-Lisp mode, a newline character has syntax
class `##comment ender##', and a carriage return character has syntax
class `symbol'. Character class ##[:space:]## corresponds only to
characters with syntax class `whitespace'.)












[:IciclesCompileOrGrep]
=== Compile/Grep Search: `icicle-compilation-search' ===

In a compilation-results buffer, such as `*Compilation*' or `*grep*', you can use command
'''`icicle-compilation-search'''', bound to '''`##C-c `##'''', to search among the
result set (search hits).  This is similar to `icicle-search', but when you use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-down', `C-up',  
`C-next', `C-prior', `C-end', or `C-home', it visits the source code that corresponds to the current line in the compilation buffer.  Just as for `icicle-search', you can narrow the
set of [[search context]]s by typing a regexp.

Using `icicle-compilation-search' with `grep' gives you two levels
of regexp searching: 1) the `grep' regexp and 2) your current input regexp. And you can of course use [[progressive completion]] (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to add any number of additional levels. (And, starting with Emacs 22, you can pipe to other `grep' commands in the same `M-x grep'.)










==== Use `grep' and Compilation Output for Search-and-Replace ====

In Emacs 22 and later, you can also ''replace'' search-hit text.  You
can replace the entire `grep' regexp match or just the part of it
that matches your current input, depending on the value of [[option]]
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag|icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag]]</tt>'''' (which you can toggle
with `##M-_##').  Replacement acts here just as it does for
`icicle-search'.  

You can also use a non-`grep' compilation buffer to perform search and replace. Use it, for example, to correct errors in source files.

'''Icicles''' thus gives you several ways to perform search-and-replace throughout multiple files: `grep'/compilation, `icicle-occur', and `icicle-search'.  The latter is of course not limited to line-by-line search.

'''See Also:''' [[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]].  








[:IciclesShell]
=== Input Reuse in Interactive Interpreter Modes: `icicle-comint-search' ===

In an interactive interpreter mode such as `shell-mode' or interactive Lisp mode, you can search for and reuse a previous input, possibly editing it first.  Command '''`icicle-comint-search'''', bound to '''`##C-c `##'''', lets you use '''Icicles''' completion and
[[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycling]] to access your previous (shell or Lisp) inputs; it uses `icicle-search', so it
highlights your regexp input matches, and so on. You can use `##C-$##' at any time to toggle removal of duplicate past inputs as completion candidates; by default, duplicates are removed.

Being a search command, however, `icicle-comint-search' has access
only to the commands that are visible in the buffer.  It does not
use the `comint-input-ring', so it cannot, for instance, give you
access to commands used in a previous session, which might have
been recorded in a history file.

Another '''Icicles''' command, '''`icicle-comint-command'''', which is not a
search command, does use `comint-input-ring' and does give you completion and cycling against
previous inputs that might not have come from the current session.
It is bound to '''`C-c TAB'''' in `comint-mode' and derived modes.












[:DefineSearchCommands]
=== Define Your Own Icicles Search Commands ===

Function `icicle-search' is not only a useful user command; it is
also a framework for you to define your own '''Icicles''' search
commands.  Consult the source code for the commands presented
above for models.  And consult the [[doc string]] of `icicle-search'
for more information about calling it non-interactively.  In
particular, note that:

* You can pass a functional argument instead of a regexp to `icicle-search', and
it will use that ''function to define the search
contexts''.  The function is passed, as arguments, the buffer to
search, the beginning and end of the search region in that
buffer, and any additional arguments that you pass to
`icicle-search'.

* You can pass a ''predicate'' argument to `icicle-search', in
addition to passing a regexp, and the search contexts will be
only those regexp matches that also satisfy the predicate.  The
predicate takes two arguments, the search-context string and a
marker at the end of the search context.  For information about
this, consult the doc string for function
`icicle-search-regexp-scan'.  For a model of using this feature,
see the code that defines command `icicle-imenu'.

By using your own function to define the search contexts, either
from scratch or by limiting regexp matches using a predicate, you
can perform ''semantic-based searching''.  That is, your search
command can use information besides syntax to define search hits.
For instance, commands `icicle-imenu-command' and
`icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' use the semantic predicate
`commandp' to distinguish EmacsLisp commands from non-interactive
functions.
