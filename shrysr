I am Shreyas Ragavan.

I mostly live in Emacs, probably since 2015. However, I do not know much elisp! 
Arguably Emacs and [[OrgMode]] changed my life, ultimately enabling me to transition from mechanical engineering and computational physics into software development and data analytics.

Typically on IRC with the nick shrysr.

* Emacs config (for now) -- https://shreyas.ragavan.co/docs/emacs-config/
* sr.ht -- https://git.sr.ht/~shrysr - I'm moving all my repos from github to sr.ht. 
* Github -- https://github.com/shrysr
