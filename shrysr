I am Shreyas Ragavan.

I mostly live in Emacs, and it has probably been about 5 years. However, I do not know much elisp! 
Arguably Emacs and [[OrgMode]] changed my life, ultimately enabling me to transition from mechanical engineering and computational physics into software development and data analytics.

Typically on IRC with the nick shrysr.
