Lisp:win-switch.el defines a dynamic, transient mode that allows
easy and efficient navigation among [[window]]s (and [[frame]]s).

When window switching mode is on, window movement and
resizing commands are bound to simple keys that can
be quickly pressed with one hand. 
(Additional keys allow resizing, splitting, and deleting
windows.) Any other key sequence ends window switching
and executes its original function. (Window switching
is also exited with an explicit command key or after
a preset idle time.) With this in place, navigating
among complicated window configurations can happen
seamlessly with minimal movement or fuss.


== Introduction ==

One wonderful efficiency feature in Emacs is the ability to
divide the current view into disjoint rectangular panels
(called windows in Emacs terminology) that can be seen and
manipulated simultaneously.[[#fn1]][:fn1Back] Taken together, Emacs
windows and buffers provide a much more versatile and
efficient interface than tabbed browsing or similar designs.

It is not uncommon for people to keep four to six or more windows in a
frame. But when you use multiple windows in this way, you
may frequently find yourself moving among the windows using
`other-window' (<code>C-x o</code>) again and again -- an unpleasantly
large number of keystrokes for so common a maneuver. And
because the order of windows in the window list need not
relate intuitively to windows' visual positions, moving more
efficiently requires context-specific prefix arguments along
the way. The tiring outcome is that navigation through a
complex window configuration demands many keystrokes and/or
nontrivial attention. This package is designed to solve that
problem.

While the `windmove' package provides functions for moving
intuitively among windows, the natural key bindings for these
functions (e.g., the arrow keys with some modifier) require a
distant and thus inefficient hand movement. Moreover, one often
wants to mix a variety of window-based operations (other-window,
previous-window, directional movement, resizing) in rapid
succession, which windmove does not easily support.

This package builds on the windmove functionality by defining a
command <code>win-switch-dispatch</code> that engages a dynamic, transient
keyboard override, allowing one to efficiently move among defined
windows (and frames) -- and even resize, split, delete them -- with
minimal fuss and effort. When the override is engaged, the movement
and resizing commands are bound to simple keys that can be pressed
quickly with one hand. The override ends either when the user exits
explicitly or after a configurable idle time threshold. The happy
outcome is fast and seamless navigation.


== Installation ==

To use the package, download Lisp:win-switch.el and place it
somewhere in your load path.[[#fn2]][:fn2Back] (You can also obtain
the package through <code>package.el</code> from the [http://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] repository.)
Then, execute the following code
either directly or from in your .emacs file:

<pre>
    (require 'win-switch)
    (global-set-key "\C-xo" 'win-switch-dispatch)
</pre>

or use whatever keybinding you ordinarily have set to `other-window'.
Alternatively, you can use one of a variety of predefined configuration
commands, as in

<pre>
    (require 'win-switch)
    (win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl "\C-xo")
</pre>

which has the same effect as the above. In fact, the latter approach
is preferred somewhat as it makes it easier to explore other configurations
or bindings. See [[#WinSwitchConfig]] below.

At this point, when you execute a window switch (i.e., hit ~C-x o~),
Emacs will (typically) enter window switching mode allowing you to navigate
among the windows (and frames). This is described in more detail in
the next section.


== Using win-switch ==

When executing the <code>win-switch-dispatch</code> command, Emacs's
behavior depends on the win-switch parameter settings and
the current window configuration. Under the default
settings, when there are three or more windows, Emacs will
enter window switching mode. This temporarily overrides all
key bindings, with selected keys moving among the windows
(or frames) and resizing, splitting, or deleting the current
window. Window switching lasts until either the user exits
explicitly (in one of two ways) or idle time exceeds the
threshold in the variable <code>win-switch-idle-time</code>. Whenever
possible, visual feedback is provided to indicate the window
switching state. The following keys are bound by default
during window switching mode:

* Directional Navigation
** i select the window above the current window.
** k select the window below the current window.
** j select the window left of the current window.
** l select the window right of the current window.
* Cycling Navigation
** o cycles forward through the window list in the current frame.
** p cycles backward through the window list in the current frame.
** SPACE cycles among existing frames.
* Exiting
** u (and RETURN) exit window switching mode.
** Any key not bound to a win-switch command exits
        window switching mode (like u does) and then executes
        the original function.
** Waiting idle for more than <code>win-switch-idle-time</code> will
        exit window switching mode (like u does)
** ##*C-M-g*## is an "emergency" exit [[#fn3]][:fn3Back]
* Resizing
** I vertically enlarges the current window
** K vertically shrinks the current window
** L horizontally enlarges the current window
** J horizontally shrinks the current window
* Splitting and Deleting Windows
** h splits the current window into two equal windows,
        one above the other.  (H is a visual mnemonic for the split.)
** ; splits the current window into two equal windows,
        side by side. (: is a visual mnemnoic for the split.)
** 0 deletes the current window  
       
These keys are chosen to make one-handed navigation fast and easy.
It is worth re-emphasizing that any key not bound to a win-switch
command exits window switching mode and executes its original function.
This is the most common way to exit window switching mode: just do what
you want to do in the current window and it will be done.
An explicit exit is only required when the first key in the
current window is one of the win-switch commands, which should be
relatively rare.

By default, window selection wraps around when moving across a frame
edge and window switching mode is forgone when there are only two
windows. But these features, the key bindings, and other parameters
can all be customized, either with the customization facility or
with defvar and setter functions, as described in the next section.


== Configuring win-switch == [:WinSwitchConfig]

=== Key bindings ===
The default keybindings are designed for fast and intuitve,
one-handed operation, but if desired the key bindings can be
easily adjusted or reset. There are several pre-defined key
configurations; the key-bindings can be set via the
customization mechanism; and there are several functions for
modifying the keys associated with particular commands.

==== Pre-defined key configurations ====

* <code>win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl</code>
:: Sets the default keys centered around the i-j-k-l
directional keys. Accepts as argument one or more
key-sequences to bind to <code>win-switch-dispatch</code>, as
in
<pre>
        (win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl "\C-xo" "\C-x\C-o")
</pre>

* <code>win-switch-set-keys-arrow-ctrl</code>,
<code>win-switch-set-keys-arrow-meta</code>,
<code>win-switch-set-keys-arrows</code>
:: Sets keys that are centered around the arrow keys,
which are used for directional window switching.
Control, Meta, or another modifier (respectively)
with an arrow key makes a move in that direction
and enters window switching mode.

* <code>win-switch-set-keys-esdf</code>
:: Left-handed version of the ijkl directional
key configuration.
       

==== Customize Options ====

The command keys also can be rebound in groups via the
variables with names =win-switch-<name>-keys= where =<name>=
can be one of up, down, left, right, next-window,
previous-window, enlarge-vertically, shrink-vertically,
enlarge-horizontally, shrink-horizontally, other-frame,
exit, split-vertically, split-horizontally, delete-window,
or emergency-exit. These variables should *not* be set
directly, but rather should be set either by the customize
mechanism, or by using the functions described below.

==== Key-setting API ====

Several functions are available for adjusting the key lists
associated with a particular win-switch command. These are
<code>win-switch-add-key</code>, <code>win-switch-delete-key</code>, and
<code>win-switch-set-keys</code>, which as the names suggest add and
delete a key and set the key list, respectively. These
functions take a key (or key-list in the latter case) and a
command symbol, where the command symbol is one of up, down,
left, right, next-window, previous-window,
enlarge-vertically, shrink-vertically, enlarge-horizontally,
shrink-horizontally, other-frame, exit, split-vertically,
split-horizontally, delete-window, or emergency-exit. They
are used as follows:

<pre>
  (win-switch-add-key    "O" 'previous-window)
  (win-switch-delete-key "p" 'previous-window)
  (win-switch-set-keys   '(" " "," "m") 'other-frame)
</pre>

Note that the last arguments here are win-switch commands
not elisp functions. At least one exit key must always be
defined.

The function <code>win-switch-define-key</code> is also available for
setting general commands in the win-switch keymap, but the
other key setting functions and methods are certainly
preferred when applicable.

If key bindings are not set by the customize mechanism,
they can be set in in the hook <code>win-switch-load-hook</code> before
loading the package. 

==== Once-Keys ====

The "command" <code>win-switch-dispatch-once</code> is a prefix command/keymap
that can be used in place of the standard <code>win-switch-dispatch</code>
command. This accepts a single win-switch command, by default
using the same keybindings as standard win-switch (excluding
the exit keys), and gives one switch. There are two additional
groups of keys <code>double-next-window</code> and <code>double-previous-window</code>
which cycle forward and backward two windows in the list.
While not as flexible as window switching mode, the once-dispatch
allows easy maneuvering in up to five windows with a single
key stroke. The once command keys can be set with either
the customize mechanism or the <code>win-switch-set-once-key</code> function.

==== win-switch-dispatch-with ====

The macro <code>win-switch-dispatch-with</code> accepts an elisp command
and produces a new command that first executes the given
command and then <code>win-switch-dispatch</code>. It can be used
to create dispatch commands with customized initial behavior.
See <code>win-switch-setup-keys-arrows</code> for an example.


=== Controlling win-switch behavior ===

Besides key bindings, the most important customization options are
the following:

* `win-switch-idle-time'
:: Window switching mode exits automatically after Emacs is
idle for more than this time. The idle time should be
set so that one does not have to either rush or wait.
(While explicit exit always works, it is nice to have
window-switching mode end on its own at just the right
time.) This may require some personalized fiddling to
find a comfortable value, though the default should be
pretty good.

* `win-switch-window-threshold'
:: When the current frame has more than this many windows,
<code>win-switch-dispatch</code> enters window-switching mode
unconditionally; otherwise, it acts like
<code>win-switch-other-window-function</code> (which is
<code>other-window</code> by default).
* `win-switch-other-window-first'
:: Whether to move to next window in the window list before
entering window switching mode. This can be either a
boolean value or a function that returns a boolean
function. The latter allows a context sensitive
decision; see <code>win-switch-authors-configuration</code> for an
example.
* `win-switch-wrap-around'  (set via <code>win-switch-set-wrap-around</code>.)
:: If non-nil, directional moves across the edge of the
frame wrap around to the other side of the frame
(top to bottom, left to right, etc.). This should
not be set directly but by the setting function
<code>win-switch-set-wrap-around</code>.
* `win-switch-other-window-function'
:: If non-nil, this should be a function that handles the
window switching as does <code>other-window</code>. One application
of this parameter is when win-switch is used with
packages like icicles that remap the other-window
function (see <code>icicle-other-window-or-frame</code>). If nil,
the default, <code>other-window</code> is used.
  
  
The other customizable parameters control how win-switch
mode gives feedback indicating whether window switching is
engaged.

* `win-switch-provide-visual-feedback'
* `win-switch-feedback-background-color'
* `win-switch-feedback-foreground-color'
* `win-switch-on-feedback-function'
* `win-switch-off-feedback-function'

The feedback mechanisms are intended to make it salient when
window switching mode is on or off and can be customized at
several scales. The default method changes the
colors on the mode line in the current window during
window switching mode (restoring them after), along
with transient messages in the echo area.

Finally, three hooks are available to change settings or
behavior at load time, when window switching turns on, and
when window switching turns off. Extra care should be taken
to handle errors properly in the latter two, if they are
used.

* `win-switch-load-hook'
* `win-switch-on-hook'
* `win-switch-off-hook'

== Testing and Bug Reports ==

The associated package Lisp:ws-tests.el in the same repository
contains a framework for automated testing of win-switch.
Load the package and execute the comand <code>ws-test-run-all</code>
within emacs, i.e. do <code>M-x ws-test-run-all</code>. (There are
other ways to run tests in the framework but that is the
simplest.) It might be a good idea to manually increase the
frame size above the small default initial size before
running the tests. A report on the test results will then
come up, typically in its own frame. If there are any
failures, instructions for reporting tne tests will be
given. Please copy the test report and provide as much
information as you can about your platform, emacs setup, and
ideally your emacs init file. New tests will be added over
time.

If when using Lisp:win-switch.el, you encounter any problems,
anomalies, or curiosities, please report them to me at
##*genovese@cmu.edu*##, along with information about your
platform, emacs version, and emacs initialization. In
addition, feel free to send me feature requests to the same
address. In both cases, I would appreciate if you would
include "win-switch" on the subject line.


== Notes ==

win-switch is not a formal major or minor mode, more of an
overriding mode. This started as a way to explore dynamic
keybindings, an idea that is generalized considerably in my
packages <code>quick-nav</code> and <code>power-keys</code>. The latter introduces
some programming abstractions that can be used to easily
install dynamic keymaps of several flavors. I plan to use
the <code>power-keys.el</code> mechanisms for this package in a later
version.

The code is also available from [https://github.com/genovese/win-switch github].

== Footnotes ==

[::fn1] 
There is an unfortunate conflict in terminology between Emacs
and traditional window systems. An Emacs [[frame]] corresponds to a
/window/ in a traditional window system. An Emacs [[window]] is a
panel within a frame that displays a [[buffer]]. There is no direct
analog to windows and buffers in standard window systems, though
tabbed browsing is perhaps the closest common approach.
I will use Emacs terminology in what follows. [[#fn1Back]]

[::fn2] 
Common locations are the system site-lisp directory or
the sub-directory <code>.emacs.d</code> of the user's home directory.
Alternatively, you can load the file directly with the
<code>load-file</code> command. [[#fn2Back]]

[::fn3] 
The emergency exit key causes a no-frills escape from
window switching mode in case of an unexpected error during
a user defined function or hook (as a customization option)
called during window switching mode. This is a paranoid
precaution only, and you are very unlikely to need this. Use
only as a last resort because it does not handle feedback or
other clean up mechanisms. This functionality may be removed
in future versions. [[#fn3Back]]
