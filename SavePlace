Purpose: When you visit a file, point goes to the last place where it was when you previously visited the same file.

To use it, turn it on in the options menu - "Save place in files between Sessions".

Alternatively, you could add the following to your InitFile:

[h2]For GNU Emacs 25.1 and newer versions[/h2]

{{{
(save-place-mode 1) 
}}}

Note that <code>saveplace</code> is auto-loaded by <code>save-place-mode</code>. So you do not need to explicitly require it.

[h2]For GNU Emacs 24.5 and older versions[/h2]

{{{
(require 'saveplace)
(setq-default save-place t)
}}}
Note that using <code>setq</code> will not do because the variable is buffer-local.

[h2]Options[/h2]

Your saved places are written to the file stored in the file specified by <code>save-place-file</code>. This defaults to <code>~/.emacs.d/places</code> in newer emacs versions (25.1+) and to <code>~/.emacs-places</code> in older emacs versions. In the latter case, you might want to change it to keep your home directory uncluttered.

For example:
{{{
(setq save-place-file (locate-user-emacs-file "places" ".emacs-places"))
}}}

If emacs is slow to exit after enabling saveplace, you may be running afoul of <code>save-place-forget-unreadable-files</code>. On exit, it checks that every loaded file is readable before saving its buffer position - potentially very slow if you use NFS.  

{{{
(setq save-place-forget-unreadable-files nil)
}}}
will restores emacs exit to nearly instantaneous.

[h2]emacs server (daemon)[/h2]
saveplace may not work as expected when you are using emacs server. The problem is that desktop logout commands often terminate emacs with a signal that emacs does not handle.

This can be worked around under Linux, by using a shell script to logout from the session. This script will have to be executed by the user. The script first terminates emacs, including the server, with a signal that emacs handles. It then waits for all emacs processes to exit, then calls the command to logout from the session. Below is a script that can be used with the Ubuntu desktop:
[code]
#!/bin/bash
pkill "emacs"
while pgrep --count "emacs"; do
    # echo $?
    sleep 1
done
gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt
[/code]
