Am I missing something, or does this page not mention how to setup dired+ for use?

Perhaps the default diredp-compressed-extensions today should also have "xz" and "lzma"?

@[[xuhdev]]: I don't see why, a priori.  But if you provide (good) reasons then I'll consider them. (You can of course customize the value.) Here are lists of possible compressed-file extensions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats.

@[[DrewAdams]] because the xz format is pretty ubiquitous now. Quoted from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils Wikipedia XZ utils]]:

{{A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch Linux,[4] use xz for compressing their software packages. The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.}}

Even Linux has switched their public download format to xz (check out the download link on [[https://www.kernel.org/ their web page]]) At least, I think, xz should be added as it is quite common now.

OK, thanks. Done. https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/dired%2b.el

Is there a way to remove a line from a Dired+ buffer, the way C-x D A adds files to a Dired+ buffer?

-- user2867994 2017-09-13 13:17 UTC

@user2867994: 

1. You can use `k' (command `dired-do-kill-lines') to do that. Provide a prefix arg for the number of lines (starting with point), or mark the lines to remove.

2. You can also mark files and dirs in the listing, and then use command command `diredp-omit-marked' to ''omit'' them (also on menu-bar menu `Marks' > `Omit' > `Omit Marked').

How to use Dired+ on Spacemacs?

Last week I installed Dired+ and used it to successfully create two fileset files.
Today I try again but running into some issues. This is what I did:
    C-x D A
    select a file
    C-g
    SPC f c (copy-file)
    enter file name: .fs_Code

Looking at the directory from the terminal:
    ls -A
    #.fs_Code#
What do the #s mean?

I try to rename #.fs_Code# to .fs_Code:
    open file #.fs_Code#
    SPC f R (rename-current-buffer-file)
    enter new file name: .fs_Code
Emacs says that the file already exists.

I try to use Dired+ again to create a fileset file:
    C-x
But this time 'D' is missing from the Spacemacs menu.

I am still new to Emacs, so maybe I am doing it wrong.  And I don't fully understand the manuals.

Or maybe I installed Dired+ the wrong way.  Although the Dired+ help displays as expected:
    M-x diredp-dired-plus-help

From my .spacemacs file:

    (defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
      (setq-default
    ..
       dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(dired+)
    )
    ..
    (custom-set-variables
     '(package-selected-packages
       (quote
        (disaster dired+


Is this the right place to post the Dired+ install question, or should it be posted on the Spacemaces forum?

@user2867994: I don't know Spacemacs, so I can't help with that.  

"Installing" Dired+ is simple - you probably did it correctly.  (You really need only to put `dired+.el' in your `load-path' and `require' it.  But you can of course use the package manager to "install" it if you prefer.)

For such detailed questions, it's better to email me (see the file header). And for questions about files named `###something# ##' see the the Emacs manual, node `Auto Save' and its subnodes.  Those are auto-save files.

Hello,

I am having trouble adding subdirectories recursively to bookmarks.
I can't see clearly the differences between the 4 diredp bookmark recursive functions, but I believe the correct one for subdirectories is:

"diredp-do-bookmark-dirs-recursive"

I am using it without marking any directory.

The result is that I get just two bookmarks:

    The first one, for the directory where Dired is open: "dir1 Bmkp-Dired ...path"

    The second one: "dir1 and subdirs Bmkp-Sequence   "


Is it not possible to generate a separate bookmark for each subdirectory?

Best regards,

Windows 11
GNU Emacs 29.3 (build 2, x86_64-w64-mingw32)

If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, just do this: `C-u M-+ M-B'.

The `C-u' says to use the Dired buffers listing all of the subdirs (of the current Dired buffer).

The `M-+ M-B' says to create a bookmark for each of those Dired buffers, that is, for each Dired buffer of a subdir of the current Dired buffer.

The Dired+ commands whose names end with `-recursive' act on marked files and on marked subdirs that have their own Dired buffers (or on all such if you tell the commands to do that, using `C-u'). 

This Dired+ command acts on marked subdirs (or all subdirs) that have Dired buffers. It creates a Dired bookmark in each of those buffers.

Do you have multiple Dired buffers? That's the starting point.

HTH.

Hi Drew!

I am testing this in just one Dired buffer.

I have created some sub dirs with and without files.

I would like that each one of those dirs is added to bookmarks. 

By now, I have to add manually, one by one, each subdir to bookmarks, and I don't add more profound subdirs because it would be too much work.

If I call `C-u M-+ M-Bâ€™ or "C-u M-x diredp-do-bookmark-dirs-recursive" I get the bookmarks I mentioned above:
"dir1 Bmkp-Dired ...path"
"dir1 and subdirs Bmkp-Sequence   "

Again, the `diredp-do-...-recursive' commands act on marked files and dirs in the current Dired buffer, and they do that recursively for any marked dirs in the buffer that have their own Dired buffers. IOW, it's about recursively descending into marked dirs that have their own Dired buffers. With `C-u' they do the same, but for all files and dirs in each buffer, not just those that are marked.

`M-+ M-B' creates a Dired bookmark for every marked directory in the current Dired buffer and for each marked directory in the Dired buffer (if any) of any of those marked directories ... recursively. With `C-u' marks are ignored: it acts on all dirs in the current Dired buffer and in any Dired buffers for those dirs ... recursively.

There probably is not, immediately, a command to do what I think you're trying to do. Probably, for now, some manual marking or creation of Dired buffers is required - dunno.

----

Note that, using `i',  that you can insert subdirs (at any level) into an ancestor Dired listing. That's the ordinary/longstanding way to act on files in different directories of a hierarchy. What Dired+ offers with its `diredp-do-...-recursive' commands are ways to act on files in *different* Dired buffers. (The listings in those different Dired buffers can themselves include subdir listings, and the `diredp-do-...-recursive' commands generally act on those too.)

----

FWIW, I *might* define new commands such as these when I get around to it:

1. Insert all dirs that are marked in the current listing into that listing. IOW, like `i' but acting on all marked dirs, not just the dir of the current line.

2. Dired all dirs that are marked in the current listing; that is, open a Dired buffer for each of them.

3. A recursive version of #2.

HTH.
