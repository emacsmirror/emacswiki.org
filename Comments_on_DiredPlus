Am I missing something, or does this page not mention how to setup dired+ for use?

Perhaps the default diredp-compressed-extensions today should also have "xz" and "lzma"?

@[[xuhdev]]: I don't see why, a priori.  But if you provide (good) reasons then I'll consider them. (You can of course customize the value.) Here are lists of possible compressed-file extensions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats.

@[[DrewAdams]] because the xz format is pretty ubiquitous now. Quoted from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils Wikipedia XZ utils]]:

{{A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch Linux,[4] use xz for compressing their software packages. The GNU FTP archive also uses xz.}}

Even Linux has switched their public download format to xz (check out the download link on [[https://www.kernel.org/ their web page]]) At least, I think, xz should be added as it is quite common now.

OK, thanks. Done. https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/dired%2b.el

Is there a way to remove a line from a Dired+ buffer, the way C-x D A adds files to a Dired+ buffer?

@user2867994: 

1. You can use `k' (command `dired-do-kill-lines') to do that. Provide a prefix arg for the number of lines (starting with point), or mark the lines to remove.

2. You can also mark files and dirs in the listing, and then use command command `diredp-omit-marked' to ''omit'' them (also on menu-bar menu `Marks' > `Omit' > `Omit Marked').

How to use Dired+ on Spacemacs?

Last week I installed Dired+ and used it to successfully create two fileset files.
Today I try again but running into some issues. This is what I did:
    C-x D A
    select a file
    C-g
    SPC f c (copy-file)
    enter file name: .fs_Code

Looking at the directory from the terminal:
    ls -A
    #.fs_Code#
What do the #s mean?

I try to rename #.fs_Code# to .fs_Code:
    open file #.fs_Code#
    SPC f R (rename-current-buffer-file)
    enter new file name: .fs_Code
Emacs says that the file already exists.

I try to use Dired+ again to create a fileset file:
    C-x
But this time 'D' is missing from the Spacemacs menu.

I am still new to Emacs, so maybe I am doing it wrong.  And I don't fully understand the manuals.

Or maybe I installed Dired+ the wrong way.  Although the Dired+ help displays as expected:
    M-x diredp-dired-plus-help

From my .spacemacs file:

    (defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
      (setq-default
    ..
       dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(dired+)
    )
    ..
    (custom-set-variables
     '(package-selected-packages
       (quote
        (disaster dired+


Is this the right place to post the Dired+ install question, or should it be posted on the Spacemaces forum?

@user2867994: I don't know Spacemacs, so I can't help with that.  

"Installing" Dired+ is simple - you probably did it correctly.  (You really need only to put `dired+.el' in your `load-path' and `require' it.  But you can of course use the package manager to "install" it if you prefer.)

For such detailed questions, it's better to email me (see the file header). And for questions about files named `###something# ##' see the the Emacs manual, node `Auto Save' and its subnodes.  Those are auto-save files.
