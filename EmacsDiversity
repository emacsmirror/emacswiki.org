Goals for this page:

* Help people find people like them: "I feel a little isolated. I don't know other Emacs users, and it seems you have to be a real computer geek in order to use Emacs. Are there people like me?"
* Show the diversity of Emacs community and the diversity of Emacs use: "What are some different ways you can use Emacs, and what kinds of people use Emacs?"

* [https://randyridenour.net/posts/2025-07-28-emacs-writing-experience.html#fnr.2 Emacs Writing Experience] "Instead, I’m a philosophy professor at a small liberal arts university, which means that I live in a Microsoft world. It’s very likely that I am the only Emacs user on campus. I’m also a retired Army Reserve chaplain. I’m sure that Emacs users are a minority in technical fields, but they are almost non-existent in the humanities. One can only imagine how few Emacs users there are in ministry."

* [https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.en.html]: "Multics Emacs proved to be a great success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program."
