== Elisp Interface ==

Code by EricMarsden for a socket-level elisp interface to PostgreSQL.

* Look for pg.el [[http://www.chez.com/emarsden/downloads/|here]]
* For newer versions look at [http://www.online-marketwatch.com/pgel/pg.html pg.el]
* There is also a version hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/cbbrowne/pg.el

If you don't require a flashy interface and sophisticated programming
language features this may be a good option. Otherwise near the same
URL you can find a Common Lisp implementation of the same code, which
has better exception handling support.

NicFerrier's EmacsDb has a [https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-db-pg backend] for PostgreSQL

== Info Documentation ==

You can convert Postgres' DocBook docs to Texinfo via docbook2X for
ultimate studying pleasure within Emacs.  With 8.2, '''make
postgres.info''' in '''doc/src/sgml/''' should automate this somewhat
when you have docbook2X and toolchains for SGML, XML, and Texinfo
installed.

Here's how the result looks like with the 8.3.3 docs:

== Using outline-minor-mode with SQL Dumps ==

I recently discovered that using outline-minor-mode is quite an
elegant way to deal with vast SQL dumps.  The following snippet will
automatically set it up when visiting pg_dump output.

 (defun my-possibly-setup-pgdump-outline nil
   (interactive)
   (save-excursion
     (goto-char (point-min))
     (forward-line 1)
     (when (looking-at "-- PostgreSQL database dump")
       (set (make-local-variable 'outline-regexp)
 	   "-- \\(Data for \\)?Name:")
       (set (make-local-variable 'outline-level)
 	   (lambda nil 1))
       (outline-minor-mode 1)
       (hide-sublevels 1))))
 
 (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook 'my-possibly-setup-pgdump-outline)
