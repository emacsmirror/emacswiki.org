There is a GPL version labelled as "A C refactoring tool for emacs" at http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/files/
All other references to the original Xrefactory seems to be gone...

[http://www.responsive.se/thomas/2014/08/30/xrefactory-to-c-xref-refactoring-c-with-emacs/ Here's] a write up of recent experience with it.

[old]
[http://www.xref-tech.com/xrefactory/main.html Xrefactory] is a tool for C and C++ providing code completion, source browsing and refactoring.

It is [http://www.xref-tech.com/xrefactory/license.html not Free Software].  Investigate a free RefactoringBrowser, instead.

The older releases of Xrefactory that work with Emacs are "no-cost" (''gratis'') -- with the restriction that you are not allowed to resell the software.  Redistributions free of charge are allowed.  Attempts to encourage the owners to release the code under a free license have not had any results.  The C++ version has remained fully proprietary.

It seems very impressive, but does it deliver what it claims?

I used Xrefactory in my previous job, on a fairly large Java code
  base referencing many libraries.  It worked pretty well, especially
  the "semantic" tab completion and code navigation.  The C/Java
  version is now apparently free (used to be $29), but I don't know if
  it is still being updated (the downloadable version does not support
  newer JDKs). --Damien Diederen

These products (xrefactory c/java, xrefactory c++) seems to be abandoned. The c++ version does not work very well with recent c++ code (like one found in new versions of boost).
