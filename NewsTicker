<code>newsticker.el</code> is an RSS / Atom feed reader included as of Emacs 22.

Newsticker can display news feeds from various websites ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OtherRecentChanges like this one]]), allowing you to continuously stay up-to-date with their content.

You can start newsticker with <code>M-x newsticker-treeview</code>

== Overview ==

Some exerpts from the Newsticker manual -- Newsticker:

* Retrieves /headlines/ from a list of news sites.
* Provides a front-end for /reading and managing/ them.
* /Headlines/ consist of a *title*, *description*, and a *link* to the full story.
* A /description/ may be a brief summary or a full article.
* Newsticker downloads news /periodically/ in the background.

== Tree View ==

As of version 1.99, Newsticker offers a "treeview," in which feeds can be gathered into arbitrary groups for more efficient reading. The treeview tiles three windows -- one showing the feed hierarchy, another showing the list of articles in the selected feed, and a third showing the text of the selected article.

== Plain View ==

Newsticker also includes the old "plainview", a simpler alternative to treeview (similar to what ##org-feed.el## provides). Add the following in your init file:
