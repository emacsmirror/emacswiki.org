<code>newsticker.el</code> is an RSS / Atom feed reader included as of Emacs 22.

Newsticker can display news feeds from various websites ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OtherRecentChanges like this one]]), allowing you to continuously stay up-to-date with their content.

From the package commentary:

: A newsticker is a thing that
asynchronously retrieves a list of headlines (which are contained in
RDF Site Summary (RSS) files) from a list of news sites, displays
these headlines, and allows for loading the corresponding articles
in a web browser.

As of version 1.99, Newsticker offers a "treeview," in which feeds can be gathered into arbitrary groups for more efficient reading. The treeview tiles three windows -- one showing the feed hierarchy, another showing the list of articles in the selected feed, and a third showing the text of the selected article.

For those who prefer a simple elegant interface without treeview
window that showing all the articles in single buffer (similar to
what ##org-feed.el## provides), add the following in your configuration file
to bring back the old "plainview" frontend:

    (setq newsticker-frontend 'newsticker-plainview)
