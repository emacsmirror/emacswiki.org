== Description ==
newsticker.el can display news items of news (RSS, Atom) feeds (such as the RSS of this wiki -- see OtherRecentChanges!), allowing you to keep up-to-date with sites that update their content continuously -- if and only if they provide a RSS or Atom feed.

From the package commentary:

: A newsticker is a thing that
asynchronously retrieves a list of headlines (which are contained in
RDF Site Summary (RSS) files) from a list of news sites, displays
these headlines, and allows for loading the corresponding articles
in a web browser.

<code>newsticker.el</code> first appeared in GNU Emacs version 22.

Recent versions of newsticker.el ( >= 1.99) offer a "treeview," in which feeds can be gathered into arbitrary groups for more efficient reading. The treeview tiles three windows -- one showing the feed hierarchy, another showing the list of articles in the selected feed, and a third showing the text of the selected article. Here is a [http://www.nongnu.org/newsticker/newsticker-1.99.png|screenshot] of the new treeview.

For those who prefer a simple elegant interface without treeview
window that showing all the articles in single buffer (similar to
what ##org-feed.el## provides), add the following in your configuration file
to bring back the old "plainview" frontend:

    (setq newsticker-frontend 'newsticker-plainview)
