* '''DiredMode''' is the standard Emacs mode for manipulating files and directories -- the Emacs ''file manager''. 

----
* [[Bookmark+]] -- Dired "views" (states) as bookmarks. Open sets of file bookmarks in Dired.
* DiMode -- Simple directory editor for Emacs.
* [[Dired+]] -- Many Dired extensions.
* `dired-virtual' command from DiredX.
* [[Diredful]] - colorful file names in dired buffers.
* [[DiredLaunch]] -- simple launching from dired [https://github.com/thomp/dired-launch]
* DiredSync -- Synchronize directories within dired.
* [[Eshell]]
** Read directories. See [[option]] `eshell-ls-use-in-dired'.
** `eshell-ls-use-in-dired' -- change em-ls.el to narrow the listing

* FileSets -- Persistent sets of files under given directories
* [[Icicles]] -- Access files and directories using [[completion]] and cycling. Act on (e.g. delete) files whose names match a regexp.
* [[Anything]] -- Access files and directories and much more
* Image directories with thumbnails
** ThumbsMode
** [[Tumme]]
* LsLisp -- `ls' implemented in Emacs Lisp
* [[Nav]] -- a lightweight solution for Emacs users who want something like TextMate's file browser, or the Eclipse project view [http://code.google.com/p/emacs-nav/]
* Norton Commander and Midnight Commander clones written for emacs:
** MidnightCommanderMode
** NortonCommanderMode
** [[Sunrise Commander]] -- also based on dired, but with many more features than mc.el and heavily influenced by the Orthodox File Manager standard.
** [[Sunrise Commander For Noobs]]
* [[Runner]] -- Associate a file with a set of commands or external apps.
* SystemTrash - Set up emacs to use the same trash can as GNOME and KDE (the freedesktop.org trash spec)
* [[smarterNavigatingBufferLimits]] -- "Smarter" `beginning-of-buffer' & `end-of-buffer' variants for dired
* Try ##C-h v directory-abbrev-alist RET## for information on an elegant way to shorten your paths. Suppose you'd like long paths like ##/opt/some/software/project/source/file.c## to be shortened to ##/proj/source/file.c##. The solution would be setting an appropriate symlink named ##proj## in your root directory and adding the following to your [[InitFile]]: <tt>(setq directory-abbrev-alist '("^/opt/some/software/project" . "/proj"))</tt>
* [[dir-list]] -- quickly open your frequently accessed directory or file from a configured directory/file list

Concerning <tt>directory-abbrev-alist</tt>: If there is a symbolic link in the file system, why do we need this translation table, should it not work even without it?
[new]
Concerning <tt>directory-abbrev-alist</tt>: Can it somehow be used on Windows XP (no symlinks)?

Some of these packages, including lslisp, do not seem to be in xemacs
   21.4.17, at least.  those of us trying to find a way to do
   ##--time-style = iso## in xemacs find ourselves stymied by the way the
   dired code handles switches.  is xemacs on the way out, at least
   for dired?  -- gambarimasu
