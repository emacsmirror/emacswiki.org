=== Who I am ===

Just a dude who happens to love this wonderful editor.

=== Home-made ===

I use GNU Emacs on GNU/Linux and Windows and I have done some small elisp hacks myself:

* WThirtyTwoNetSend - send multiple net messages to multiple users (>Windows NT 4)
* MakeSmartShortcuts - helping utility to organize your Start Menu in a clever way
* HideRegion - hide regions of text in a buffer regardless of mode etc
* WThirtyTwoMsgBox
* FileProps - manage file properties
* [[Tumme]] - included in Emacs 22.1 and above as `image-dired'
* [[gds]] - Emacs interface to Google Desktop Search -- probably does not work anymore...
* [[VLF]] - View larger files than Emacs normally can. Kind of works, maybe... This has now been taken over by others much more competent and it can be installed from M-x list-packages in Emacs 24.3.
* AnythingLauncher - Use Emacs as your launcher for commands, directories, web sites and whatever you can think of
