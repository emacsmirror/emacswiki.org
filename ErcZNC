ZNC.el is a customize group and a set of helpers to manage IRC connections through one or many ZNC servers.

It is available at https://github.com/sshirokov/ZNC.el

Make sure the contents of the repo, or just ./znc.el is on your load-path.

<pre>
;; Install
(require 'znc)

;; Configure
M-x customize-group znc RET

;; Engage!
; It'll prompt you for a configured server, or tell you to configure one
M-x znc-erc

; Or you can make a giant sweep and connect to freaking everything
M-x znc-all
</pre>

;; Usage

/reconnect will recycle the hell out of the server buffer.

By default, when you kill a channel buffer instead of /parting from the channel, you will detach from it
This is customizable
