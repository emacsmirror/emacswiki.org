Disclaimer: Please note that ErBot does not come in a nice packaged form for install yet.   :).  Nonetheless, if you want to install it and run it for some channels, here are *step-by-step* instructions that should be pretty easy.  ErBot is most specially suited to lispy channels like #emacs and may not necessarily be suited for your needs.  Have a look at the bot apt in #debian, and its package bobot++, to see if that suits you better-- in fact, a lot of ErBot's english interface is inspired from apt's.  Having said that, I think I like fsbot's design and syntax more --- allow the user a similar fuzzy english syntax that apt does, but that fuzzy syntax is just an interface to an accurate lisp syntax, which is also available to the user. Also, fsbot does a much smarter search-lookup, has tons of other features and is also a minor lisp interpreter.

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOUR BOT FROM A PREVIOUS, DON'T FORGET TO MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR botbbdb, userfunctions.el, ETC. BEFORE RUNNING THE NEW VERSIONS. Encoding should work properly in new botbbdb entries, but you should probably check that your old botbbdb works well with the upgraded version.
 
Please let me know if there are any steps missing from here or anything is incomplete, and also feel free to edit anything in this page. -- DeepakGoel

== Basic Installation == 

The following are geared towards emacs newbies who are using debian.  ~ refers to /home/mybot throughout this section.


<b> X/Emacs versions: Erbot is developed on and for the stable debian emacs: (21.4.1 as of dec, 2005).  It works on later emacsen, but some googling does not work on Emacs 22.1 ATM.  SebastianFreundt has ensured that erbot works on xemacs too -- 21.4 and 21.5 </b>

* Install emacs, say: apt-get -u install [-t sarge] emacs21, and
apt-get -u install [-t stable] emacs21-el. The package emacs21-el helps with ErBot's "find-function" functionality. 

* Install ERC (su and then type apt-get [-t sid] -u install erc, or when you know what you are doing, preferably get the CVS).  It is HIGHLY recommended to use ERC 5.1 or greater due to its superior flood-protection algorithm.  At some point in the future, support for earlier versions of ERC will be dropped.

* Install BBDB: apt-get -u install bbdb.

* Install Calc: apt-get -u install calc. (Part of stock Emacs 22)

* Install dictionary-el (apt-get [-t sarge] -u install dictionary-el), optional, if you don't, the dictionary funtions of the bot will not work..

* adduser mybot, and su to mybot. Please note that you need to do
  actually "su - mybot", so that you get a login shell. If you don't,
  you'll get all your paths messed up, and you'll never be sure of
  what .emacs you actually load. For the rest of the page, whenever
  you see su mybot, keep in mind that it's "su - mybot". Add all
  needed directories.  Here are some of them:  

* cd ~, mkdir elisp, mkdir public_html, ln -s public_html pub, mkdir public_html/karma.   You should make the karma directory even if you don't want the normal karma---the bot shall store the frequency of referred terms in this directory. 

* mkdir ~/public_html/data, mkdir ~/.url, touch ~/.emacs.private

* Optionally, ensure that the programs wget, w3m (used for training the bot), fortune are installed on your machine. Fsbot has functions for different types of fortunes, for access to all of them, (optionally) install all these (debian) fortunes packages: display-dhammapada, dopewars, fortunes, fortunes-min, fortunes-debian-hints, fortunes-mario, libfortune-perl, fortunes-bofh-excuses, twisted-quotes. 


* <b> erbot files: </b> Fetch all the erbot files and the README to
  ~/elisp/erbot, as in the CVS instructions below.  Make sure that the
  contents of the contrib subdirectory are saved to ~/elisp/contrib.

** OR: Simply wget the latest tar.gz dated dev "release" and gunzip it
   and untar it to ~/elisp/erbot.

* Here are the files in CVS: 
** http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/erbot/erbot/ 
** http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/erbot/


* cd ~/elisp/erbot

* export CVS_RSH="ssh"
* cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/erbot co erbot

** These files from CVS will then go in mybot's ~/elisp/erbot/erbot. 



** Or the files can be gotten from deego's current fsbot install, 

** .el's from http://gnufans.net/~deego/pub/emacspub/lisp-mine/erbot/erbot/ 
  or 
** .gz snapshots from http://gnufans.net/~deego/pub/emacspub/lisp-mine/erbot/


Place all these files in ~/elisp/. 

* su - to mybot and copy the file examples/dotemacs-mybot (included with
  ErBot) to ~/.emacs. 
  Make sure that the folowing entries appear in that .emacs:

**   (setq bbdb-case-fold-search t)
**   (setq erc-auto-query t)
**   (setq erc-server-flood-penalty 2)
**   (setq erc-server-flood-margin 10)
**   (setq erbot-paranoid-p nil)
**   (setq erbn-url-functions-p t)

* Optionally, if you want to use the alternative method of wiki training (see below), add the following line, <code>(require 'erburl)</code> in ~/.emacs immediately after <code>(require 'erball)</code> line.  Technically, it needs to be added before <code>(erbot-install)</code> so the <code>ffi-*</code> functions are mapped to the appropriate <code>ff-*</code> functions.  This library uses the <code>url</code> package which can be found in this debian package: <code>apt-get install w3-url-e21</code>.

* Optionally, if you want to permit users to let the bot learn javadoc pages (see ErBot page), add the following line, <code>(require 'erbjavadoc)</code> in ~/.emacs immediately after <code>(require 'erball)</code> line.  Technically, it needs to be added before <code>(erbot-install)</code> so the <code>ffi-*</code> functions are mapped to the appropriate <code>ff-*</code> functions. This library uses the <code>url</code> package which can be found in this debian package: <code>apt-get install w3-url-e21</code>.

* Optionally, when users paste URLs into a channel, erbot can automatically download them and scan for a TITLE element in HTML and then send a note to the channel with the description.  This can be useful for other readers on the channel.  To enable, add the following line to your .emacs: <code>(setq fs-web-page-title-p t)</code>.  Care is taken to not download binaries or mp3s and such.

* I recommend that you use the small sample provided at: http://gnufans.net/~mybot/data/botbbdb as your bot's datafile at first, so just copy this file to mybot's ~/pub/data/botbbdb.  This sample contains some iniital "help" data, which botusers will find useful.  This is also in public domain, so that you can use whatever license you want. ''Please not that '''fsbot's''' botbbdb, on the other hand,  is NOT in public domain. If you use that, you are bound to keep your botbbdb's license as GFDL (with no invariant sections). If that is what you desire, you are welcome to get the data from http://users.pepperfish.net/fsbot/data/.''

* If you want to byte-compile the ErBot source for speed, run <code>make</code>.

* To install the files to a particular place, edit Makefile to change the PREFIX and ELISPDIR options (if desired), and then run <code>make install</code>.

* That's it.  Congrats.  Your bot is ready.  Su to mybot, start emacs (type emacs) and now run it by typing any of these: 
** f9 f1
** Control-c  j SPACE
** ESC x erbot-join-servers RETURN
** M-x erbot-join-servers RETURN


=== Erbot can google. Want google? ===


* Write to google to request a license-key (expect immediate automated reply) and a permission (don't really expect a reply, IME, YMMV) for your bot to serve google search results.  Check out  http://www.google.com/apis/ .   Put that license key into mybot's ~/.emacs.private, like this:
 (setq google-license-key "foodfhjdkjdfkMYLicensekeylkfgnjkfgkjfkj")

* apt-get install w3-url-e21 (not available in more recent Ubuntu/Debian, see [[w3]] for installation instructions)

* BTW, If you want to enable the silly magic-8-ball, add (setq fsi-m8b-p t) to its .emacs.  Then it answers any questions ending in ?? using a magic-8-ball.

== Wiki Training ==

What good is an infobot unless it knows a few thousand pages. You can,
of course, train it by talking to it, but wouldn't you like that it
automatically learn a few wikis?  The good (bad?) thing about this
automated training-through-IRC is that anyone can use this to train
anyone's bot through IRC.  Thus, this section is currently a bit
geared towards those somewhat familiar with elisp.  If you are a bit
lost by this section(shouldn't be), catch hold of me or any lisp
expert and ask them to use erbwiki.el to train your bot on a
particular wiki.

<b>In this section, ~ refers to your account, you being the
person who is training someone's bot on some channel, say on #somebot. Again, when you train the bot, you use your own Emacs as yourself, not the bot's. Both you and the bot would be connected to irc, where you will (automatedly) train the bot. </b>

* add some directies to *your* account: mkdir ~/pub/, mkdir ~/pub/pub, mkdir ~/pub/pub/fsbot-train, mkdir ~/elisp, mkdir ~/elisp/erbot.

* Install w3m. (apt-get -u install w3m).

* See the file erbwiki.el, see in particular the variable,
  erbwiki-index-pages.  Customize it to add your favorite wiki (or
  website) and give it a name, say "mfw" for "my favorite wiki" Launch
  erc and join the channel in which you train (I train, for example,
  in #fsbot).  Customize erbtrain-buffer in your .emacs to point to
  that buffer.  '''Start a new Emacs -- start it in the -nw mode --
  don't do wiki training with an Emacs that you normally use to
  connect to IRC, since active channels constantly make that Emacs
  "inactive", thus delaying idledo-actions forever.''' Then, in this
  new emacs, type M-x erbwiki-connect-my (if needed for your
  configuaration, this just ensures that you are connected to irc)
  followed by M-x erbwiki-main-doit-all-one-wiki mfw RET to make your
  emacs slowly train the bot present on that channel.  That function
  will train the bot on the current wiki, it will also keep a record
  of the entries the bot has been trained on, so that future
  invocation of the function trains the bot only on the newer entries.
  The reason we asked to start emacs as -nw: Otherwise, any "X" thing
  you do, like switching workspaces, moving mouse focus, etc. will
  disturb the emacs' idle time and the idledo's may never get a chance
  to run.  For the same reason, we ask that you start a NEW emacs.

* Notice that the third field of erbwiki-index-pages can be a
  function---this can be one of the various ebrwiki-get-fields-*
  functions.  The default (nil) should probably work for you, but
  depending on how your wiki's index pages look like, you might need
  to use one of the others, or even create your own.  If you need
  advice on this, please let me know.  IF you create your own, please
  definitely do contribute your function to the main erbwiki.el


* Having done that, you probably want to simplify the process for
  yourself, so that you can type one command in a fresh emacs, say
  once a week and emacs takes care of the training.  Look at some
  existing erbwiki-main-main-* functions and define your own for your
  own wiki and from then on, you just need to call that.

* Now, you probably don't want to have to manually connect by hand every time you want to train. A workaround is to setq erbwiki-before-train-hooks to (erbwiki-connect-my) in your .emacs, where:

<pre>
 (defun erbwiki-connect-my ()
  (interactive)
  (unless (or (buffer-name-p-my "#somebot") erbwiki-connected-p-my)
    (setq erbwiki-connected-p-my t)
    (setq utils-erc-channels-list utils-erc-channels-list-train)
    (erc-select-noninteractive-my)))
</pre>

Those intermediate functions for me are here:

<pre>
 (setq utils-erc-channels-list-train
      '(("irc.freenode.net" 
         (
	  "#somebot"
	  ))))

 ;;;###autoload
 (defun buffer-name-p-my (name &optional matchfn)
  "Whether name is the name of a buffer.."
  (unless matchfn (setq matchfn 'string=))
  (member-if
   (lambda (arg)
     (funcall matchfn name 
	      (buffer-name arg)))
   (buffer-list)))
 ;;;###autoload
 (defun erc-select-noninteractive-my (&optional server port nick
					    user-full-name
					    not-connect-arg passwd)
  "Interactively run ERC, while trying to do a minimal prompting.
 Optional argument SERVER uses server as default for the input query.
 Optional argument PORT uses passed port as default for the input query.
 Optional argument NICK uses the passed nick as default for the input query."
  (interactive)
  (require 'erc)
  (if (and (null server) (listp erc-servers-my))
      (mapcar
       '(lambda (arg)
	  (erc-select-noninteractive-my
	   arg port nick user-full-name not-connect-arg passwd)
	  (sit-for 1)
	  )
       erc-servers-my)
    (progn
      (if (null server)
	  (setq server erc-server))
      ;; 2002-08-21 T11:22:35-0400 (Wednesday)    D. Goel
      (setq erc-current-server-my server)

      (if (null port) (setq port erc-port))
      (setq nick (erc-compute-nick nick))
      (let* (
	     (nick
	      (if (erc-already-logged-in server port nick)
		  (read-from-minibuffer
		   (erc-format-message 'nick-in-use ?n nick)
		   nick
		   nil nil 'erc-nick-history-list)
		nick)))
	(if (and passwd (string= "" passwd))
	    (setq passwd nil))
	(while (erc-already-logged-in server port nick)
	  (setq nick (read-from-minibuffer
		      (erc-format-message 'nick-in-use ?n nick)
		      nick
		      nil nil 'erc-nick-history-list)))
	(run-hook-with-args 'erc-before-connect server port nick)
	(erc
	 server port nick user-full-name (not not-connect-arg) passwd)))))
</pre>

* Finally, If you want the bot to forget, rename, or process large chunks of data, see erbforget.el and extend it to  your needs..

== Alternate Method of Wiki Training ==

If you want a fairly simple method of wiki training, try the following instead (requires the <code>url</code> package which can be found in this debian package: <code>apt-get install w3-url-e21</code>):

      (require 'erburl)
      (erburl-scrape-terms
         "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?action=index")

The above will load all of the terms from this wiki along with links back to the
appropriate pages in very little time (compared to the previous training method).
This call is asynchronous although you will not be able to do anything on the 
emacs console because it will be busy, but erbot will still be able to respond to
user requests in a channel if connected.  

It should be noted that this method of training does not remember what has
been added (like the previous method); however, scraping the same page more
than once will <b>not</b> add duplicate entries.

Finally, any URL can be scraped for data as you can pass your own parser
to the above function.  See the quickhelp in <code>erburl.el</code>
and the docstring for <code>erburl-scrape-terms</code>.


== Other Advanced Customization == 

* To enable logging, look at ErcLogging.

* This bot has uses defined for several extra libraries, when they are present. Most are available from http://gnufans.net/~deego/pub/emacspub/ or else, from the wepages of their authors: 
** faith.el  
** oct.el
** geek.el 

* if your bot plans to hang out on lispy channels, do comment out the line of mybot's .emacs that says (erbunlisp-install).  Here's the whole boring story:


erbot usually defines its functions to not conflict with existing lisp functions.  Thus, the usual way to remove bot entries is RM and FORGET, but not REMOVE.  The latter is a lisp function and gets passed to emacs's own lisp for processing.  

However, many people (esp. on nonlispy channels) don't care much for elisp's functions, and the first thing they try for removing entries is (remove).  Mybot's default .emacs makes that (remove) work through (erbunlisp-install)..  That function takes special care of these rare "conflicts".  IOW, (erbunlisp-install) ensures that (remove) gets passed to ERBOT's (fs-rm) function instead of lisp's (remove). REMOVE is just an example, (erbunlisp-install) shall seek to usually take care of all similar issues.



* .emacs.private is probably the right place to edit erbot-ignore-nicks, which is a list of regexps which erbot will not reply to. The primary purpose of that variable is to avoid bots getitng into infinite loops with other bots :)


* See the .emacs of mybot, it has useful stuff bound to f6 f6.  This helps keep track of channels in which mybot's circuits got triggerred in response to something, (whether or not it replied anything is a different matter).  Pressing f6 f7 resets this list. 

* Defun functions like (fs-foo) to the bot's ~/.emacs to add any more
  functions to your bot.  To disable a pre-existing function,
  (fmakunbound 'fs-foo) should work.  Note that anyone and everyone on
  irc will be able to execute your defunned function, so be careful
  when defining new functions for your bot.  A rule of thumb to ensure
  safety: Make your function use only other pre-existing fs-
  functions.  If your function makes recursive cals, don't forget to
  add a (sit-for 0) in front of the definition, else timeout will
  never get a chance to act, and your bot may hang if someone manages
  to request an infinite recursion on your function.

* To add any additional immutable functions, use the format (fsi-foo)
  instead of fs-foo.  Defun these functions at the top of your
  .emacs. When loading, the engine converts all such functions to
  fs-foo but marks them immutable.

* This might be useful.  To the end of mybot's .bashrc, add umask 022.  Add yourself to mybot's group, say via: adduser deego mybot. Also su to mybot and "chmod -R -g+rw .". Now log back out and login, Now you (deego)should be able to edit mybot's .emacs etc. without having to su to mbot.

* While it is best for you, the bot operator, to learn how to do edit botdata by talking to the bot (See the manual at ErBot), you can also edit them more easily by going to bot's emacs and typing M-x bbdb ...  if you know what you are doing...



* ErBot has many other undocumented or work-in-progress features, just chat with the author(s) for what you may have in mind, or explore the sources.  If you add/improve something or complete a feature in your sources, please contribute it back upstream :).



== More help ==



Start xchat (or how about an Emacs-based InternetRelayChat client?), go to #emacs (EmacsChannel) on the server irc.freenode.net (port 6667), and catch hold of deego or hroptatyr or any of fsbot's other authors in #fsbot or the helpful folks in #emacs.  Or send deego an email @gnufans.org.
