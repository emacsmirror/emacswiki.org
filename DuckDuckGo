[http://duckduckgo.com DuckDuckGo] is a web search engine created with the principle of privacy in mind. 
Their lemma is:

: <i>We believe in better search and real privacy at the same time.</i>

Four important things they do:

* Have [https://duckduckgo.com/goodies tons of goodies] -- Small application that you can use just typing some keywords at the search box.
* Don't [http://donttrack.us/ track you].
* Don't [http://dontbubble.us/ bubble you].
* Drop the clutter.


== DDG ==
There is an aplication for using the [http://api.duckduckgo.com DuckDuckGo API] (and use goodies!) composing of three files:

* Lisp:ddg.el -- A library for retrieving information from !DuckDuckGo. See [[DuckDuckGo-el]].
* Lisp:ddg-search.el -- Some commands for interactive searching and displaying results. Requires the next library.
* Lisp:ddg-mode.el -- A major mode for displaying properly the results.

Download all these three libraries and add the following into your InitFile(.emacs):

    (setq load-path (cons "/path/to/all/ddg/files" load-path))
    (require 'ddg)
    (require 'ddg-search)
    (require 'ddg-mode)

You can call !DuckDuckGo from the minibuffer using M-x <code>duckduckgo</code>. 

Also you can call a browser with a term using M-x <code>duckduckgo-web</code> or M-x <code>duckduckgo-emacswiki</code> for searching EmacsWiki's articles.
