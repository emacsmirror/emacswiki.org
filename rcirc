rcirc is a next generation InternetRelayChat client. It blends seamlessly with the rest of Emacs, it's tight, fast, and doesn't light up like a christmas tree. rcirc also has sane defaults. There is little or no reason to customize it because it does what you want by default (except that many people still do).

rcirc is part of GNU Emacs since release 22.0.

== Quickstart ==

If you want to chat about rcirc, the place is <tt>#rcirc</tt> on freenode. ##M-x irc## should take you there.

You can override these settings in your InitFile or use ##C-u M-x rcirc## to set server, port, username and channels.

You also can define a key to start rcirc for you:

{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'irc)
}}}

Please also consider visiting these pages in order to getting started:

* [[rcircExampleSettings]]: examples of stuff you can do to configure rcirc.
* [[rcircAutoAuthentication]]: How to get automatic authentication with nickserv &c.

==Connecting to servers using SSL/TLS ==

Emacs 24 has SSL support out of the box but rcirc doesn't use it by default. Here's how to set it up:

{{{
(setq rcirc-server-alist
      '(("irc.freenode.net" :port 6697 :encryption tls
	 :channels ("#rcirc" "#emacs" "#emacswiki"))))
}}}

Use [http://blog.freenode.net/2011/02/port-6697-irc-via-tlsssl/ port 6697].
This requires an Emacs that has been built with [http://www.gnutls.org/ GNU TLS] or an appropriate ##gnutls-cli##.

If you are on *Windows*, you can [ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ download a precompiled binary]. Make sure the ##bin## directory is on your path. Test it by calling ##gnutls-cli## from `eshell'. This is what you would expect:

{{{
Welcome to the Emacs shell

~ $ gnutls-cli
No hostname specified
}}} 

===Warnings==

//gnutls.c: [1] Note that the security level of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange has been lowered to 256 bits and this may allow decryption of the session data//

If you're getting this warning, add the following to your init file:

{{{
(setq gnutls-min-prime-bits 1024)
}}}

There's [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/83425 an explanation on the mailing list].

; [[rcirc and iswitchb]]: Hiding IRC buffers from iswitchb
; [[rcircNickBeep]]: Beep when your nick is mentioned.
; [[rcircDing]]: Beep when there is activity in a hidden channel.
; [[osx browse-url-browser-function]]: A browser function for OSX.
; [[rcircUnambiguousNickCompletion]]: Don't cycle-complete nicks if there is ambiguity
; [[rcircAlwaysKickBastard]]: Start your session by kicking the evil bastard that's stealing your nick
; [[rcircPresence]]: Make rcirc tell something else about your presence status (I'm away!)
; rcirc tracking with [[elscreen]]: when using [[elscreen]] the default "switch-to-buffer" function used by rcirc-track-minor-mode can be changed. To make rcirc switch to the screen where the buffer with the last activity is located simply add to your InitFile <code>(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer)</code>. This has a problem though: automatic switching after some actions (joining a channel, for example) will stop working. One possible solution is:
<pre>
(defun rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen (buffer)
  (if (elscreen-find-screen-by-buffer buffer)
      (elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer buffer)
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)))
		
(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen)
</pre>
; [[rcircThinklight]]: Make irc blink the Thinkpad light twice when someone talks to you.
; [[rcircDbusNotification]]: use the dbus bindings for notifications
; [[rcircOthmar]]: replace the text of /dim user's speech with nonsense
; [[rcircDisplayChannels]]: Display all open channel buffers (or query buffers) at once
; [[rcircRandomNames]]: change all the nicks to random names
; [[rcircCloudToButt]]: Replace "cloud" with "butt" and other idiocy

rcirc can highlight the channels in the mode line only when your nick is mentioned in them. Use the following code snippet:

<pre>
(rcirc-track-minor-mode 1)

(setq neale/rcirc-ignored-channels
      '(
	"#emacs" "#guile" "#guix" "#lisp" "#scheme" "#rcirc"
	))

(defun neale/rcirc-print-function (process sender response target text)
  (if (not (eq target nil))
      (with-current-buffer (rcirc-get-buffer process target)
        (cond
         ((and (equal sender (rcirc-nick process))
               (equal response "JOIN"))
          (rcirc-omit-mode)
          (when (member target neale/rcirc-ignored-channels)
            (setq rcirc-ignore-buffer-activity-flag t)))))))

(add-hook 'rcirc-print-functions 'neale/rcirc-print-function)
</pre>

==Questions & Answers==

[new]
[[VincentFoley]] asks: could anyone describe the differences between rcirc and ERC from an end-user point of view?

[new]
AlexSchroeder replies: For beginners, there should be no significant differences. After all, both claim to be easy-to-use IRC clients. The differences begin when customizing or hacking it. Neither of the two has introduced radical changes to the user interface.

WeakishJiang: I have not used ERC. But I found this piece on [[InternetRelayChat|this page]]:

[quote]
I used ERC for a while, but I was not very fond of the 20 odd files required in 
my elisp directory, so I switched to rcirc and haven’t looked back since. It does
everything I need, the (very clean) code is contained in a single file, I’m very happy!
