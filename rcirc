rcirc is an [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InternetRelayChat IRC] client. It blends seamlessly with Emacs and has sane defaults.

rcirc is part of GNU Emacs since release 22.0.

== Quickstart ==

Add a server in your InitFile, then Start rcirc with ##M-x irc##:

{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'irc)

(setq rcirc-server-alist
      '(("irc.libera.chat" ; Hostname
       :port 6697          ; Standard port for secure IRC
       :nick "linen"       ; Your nickname
       :encryption tls     ; Specify to use encryption
       :channels ("#rcirc" "#emacs" "#emacswiki"))))
}}}

To get started, see also:

* [[rcircExampleSettings|Example Settings]] -- Example rcirc configurations.
* [[rcircAutoAuthentication|Auto Authentication]] -- Make autho-auth work nicely with ##nickserv &c##.

== Using SSL ==

SSL comes with Emacs >= 24, but rcirc must enable it first (as we do above)

Emacs must be built with [http://www.gnutls.org/ GNU TLS]. On *Windows*, you can [ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ download GnuTLS]. Make sure ##bin## is in your ##PATH##. Test it by running ##gnutls-cli## from [[Eshell]]:

{{{
Welcome to the Emacs shell

~ $ gnutls-cli
No hostname specified
}}} 

: If you get the following error:

: ##gnutls.c: [1] Note that the security level of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange has been lowered to 256 bits and this may allow decryption of the session data##

: Add the following to your init file:

: <code>(setq gnutls-min-prime-bits 1024)</code>

rcirc tracking with [[elscreen]]: when using [[elscreen]] the default "switch-to-buffer" function used by rcirc-track-minor-mode can be changed. To make rcirc switch to the screen where the buffer with the last activity is located simply add to your InitFile <code>(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer)</code>. This has a problem though: automatic switching after some actions (joining a channel, for example) will stop working. One possible solution is:
<pre>
(defun rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen (buffer)
  (if (elscreen-find-screen-by-buffer buffer)
      (elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer buffer)
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)))
		
(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen)
</pre>

rcirc can highlight the channels in the mode line only when your nick is mentioned in them. Use the following code snippet:

{{{
(rcirc-track-minor-mode 1)

(setq neale/rcirc-ignored-channels '("#emacs" "#guix" "#scheme" "#rcirc"))

(defun neale/rcirc-print-function (process sender response target text)
  (if (not (eq target nil))
      (with-current-buffer (rcirc-get-buffer process target)
        (cond
         ((and (equal sender (rcirc-nick process))
               (equal response "JOIN"))
          (rcirc-omit-mode)
          (when (member target neale/rcirc-ignored-channels)
            (setq rcirc-ignore-buffer-activity-flag t)))))))

(add-hook 'rcirc-print-functions 'neale/rcirc-print-function)
}}}
