rcirc is a next generation InternetRelayChat client. It blends seamlessly with the rest of Emacs, it's tight, fast, and doesn't light up like a christmas tree. rcirc also has sane defaults. There is little or no reason to customize it because it does what you want by default (except that many people still do).

rcirc is part of GNU Emacs since release 22.0.

==Talking about rcirc==

If you want to chat about rcirc, the place is <tt>#rcirc</tt> on freenode.

==Getting rcirc==

If you are running Emacs 22, you already have it.  Skip this section.

To check out rcirc.el from EmacsFromCVS: GIT:net/rcirc.el.

New versions of rcirc do not work in Emacs 21. You can get the last version of rcirc working in Emacs 21 here: Lisp:rcirc.el.

==Starting rcirc==

In Emacs 22, just type ##M-x irc##.

In Emacs 21 and/or a very old rcirc version, you will have to add this to your InitFile:
<pre>
(eval-after-load "rcirc"                ; for Emacs 21
  '(if (not (functionp 'irc))
       (defun irc (x)
         (interactive "P")
         (if x
             (call-interactively 'rcirc)
           (rcirc rcirc-server rcirc-port rcirc-nick
                  (rcirc-startup-channels rcirc-server))))))
</pre>
then just do as usual.

rcirc comes set up with default values for IRC server and port (irc.freenode.net 6667), nickname (your login name), and channel (#rcirc). You can override these settings in your InitFile or use C-u M-x rcirc to set these values.
You also can define a key to start it for you:
<pre>
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'irc)
</pre>

Please also consider visiting these pages in order to getting started:

; [[rcircAutoAuthentication]]: How to get automatic authentication with nickserv &c.

==Connecting to servers using SSL/TLS ==

Emacs 24 has SSL support out of the box but rcirc doesn't use it by default. Here's how to set it up:

{{{
(setq rcirc-server-alist
      '(("irc.freenode.net" :port 6697 :encryption tls
	 :channels ("#rcirc" "#emacs" "#emacswiki"))))
}}}

Use [http://blog.freenode.net/2011/02/port-6697-irc-via-tlsssl/ post 6697].
This requires an Emacs that has been built with [http://www.gnutls.org/ GNU TLS] or an appropriate ##gnutls-cli##.

If you are on *Windows*, you can [ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ download a precompiled binary]. Make sure the ##bin## directory is on your path. Test it by calling ##gnutls-cli## from `eshell'. This is what you would expect:

{{{
Welcome to the Emacs shell

~ $ gnutls-cli
No hostname specified
}}} 

For *Emacs 23* you need a *fork* of rcirc:

https://github.com/nealey/rcirc/wiki 
which makes possible to use an arbitrary connection method (ssl/proxy/whatever)

or this (SSL with an optional :use-tls for `rcirc-server-alist' and :custom-connect-function for arbitrary connection method (ssl/proxy/whatever) similar to the neale's patch)

===Warnings==

##gnutls.c: [1] Note that the security level of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange has been lowered to 256 bits and this may allow decryption of the session data##

If you're getting this warning, add the following to your init file:

{{{
(setq gnutls-min-prime-bits 1024)
}}}

There's [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/83425 an explanation on the mailing list].

; rcirc tracking with [[elscreen]]: when using [[elscreen]] the default "switch-to-buffer" function used by rcirc-track-minor-mode can be changed. To make rcirc switch to the screen where the buffer with the last activity is located simply add to your InitFile <code>(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer)</code>. This has a problem though: automatic switching after some actions (joining a channel, for example) will stop working. One possible solution is:
<pre>
(defun rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen (buffer)
  (if (elscreen-find-screen-by-buffer buffer)
      (elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer buffer)
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

==Questions & Answers==

[new]
[[VincentFoley]] asks: could anyone describe the differences between rcirc and ERC from an end-user point of view?

[new]
AlexSchroeder replies: For beginners, there should be no significant differences. After all, both claim to be easy-to-use IRC clients. The differences begin when customizing or hacking it. Neither of the two has introduced radical changes to the user interface.

[new]
WeakishJiang: I have not used ERC. But I found this piece on [[InternetRelayChat|this page]]:

   I used ERC for a while, but I was not very fond of the 20 odd files required in 
   my elisp directory, so I switched to rcirc and haven’t looked back since. It does
   everything I need, the (very clean) code is contained in a single file, I’m very happy!

Hope it helps.
