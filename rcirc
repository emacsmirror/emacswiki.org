rcirc is an [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InternetRelayChat IRC] client. It blends seamlessly with Emacs and has sane defaults.

rcirc is part of GNU Emacs since release 22.0.

== Quickstart ==

If you want to chat about rcirc, the place is <tt>#rcirc</tt> on freenode. ##M-x irc## should take you there.

You can override these settings in your InitFile or use ##C-u M-x rcirc## to set server, port, username and channels.

You also can define a key to start rcirc for you:

{{{
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'irc)
}}}

Please also consider visiting these pages in order to getting started:

* [[rcircExampleSettings]]: examples of stuff you can do to configure rcirc.
* [[rcircAutoAuthentication]]: How to get automatic authentication with nickserv &c.

==Connecting to servers using SSL/TLS ==

Emacs 24 has SSL support out of the box but rcirc doesn't use it by default. Here's how to set it up:

{{{
(setq rcirc-server-alist
      '(("irc.libera.chat" :port 6697 :encryption tls
	 :channels ("#rcirc" "#emacs" "#emacswiki"))))
}}}

Use [http://blog.freenode.net/2011/02/port-6697-irc-via-tlsssl/ port 6697].
This requires an Emacs that has been built with [http://www.gnutls.org/ GNU TLS] or an appropriate ##gnutls-cli##.

If you are on *Windows*, you can [ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ download a precompiled binary]. Make sure the ##bin## directory is on your path. Test it by calling ##gnutls-cli## from `eshell'. This is what you would expect:

{{{
Welcome to the Emacs shell

~ $ gnutls-cli
No hostname specified
}}} 

===Warnings==

//gnutls.c: [1] Note that the security level of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange has been lowered to 256 bits and this may allow decryption of the session data//

If you're getting this warning, add the following to your init file:

{{{
(setq gnutls-min-prime-bits 1024)
}}}

There's [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general/83425 an explanation on the mailing list].

; [[rcirc and iswitchb]]: Hiding IRC buffers from iswitchb
; [[rcircNickBeep]]: Beep when your nick is mentioned.
; [[rcircDing]]: Beep when there is activity in a hidden channel.
; [[osx browse-url-browser-function]]: A browser function for OSX.
; [[rcircUnambiguousNickCompletion]]: Don't cycle-complete nicks if there is ambiguity

; [[rcircNormalJoin]]: Join one channel. Normally.
; rcirc tracking with [[elscreen]]: when using [[elscreen]] the default "switch-to-buffer" function used by rcirc-track-minor-mode can be changed. To make rcirc switch to the screen where the buffer with the last activity is located simply add to your InitFile <code>(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer)</code>. This has a problem though: automatic switching after some actions (joining a channel, for example) will stop working. One possible solution is:
<pre>
(defun rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen (buffer)
  (if (elscreen-find-screen-by-buffer buffer)
      (elscreen-find-and-goto-by-buffer buffer)
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)))
		
(setq rcirc-switch-to-buffer-function 'rcirc-switch-buffer-or-screen)
</pre>
; [[rcircThinklight]]: Make irc blink the Thinkpad light twice when someone talks to you.
; [[rcircDbusNotification]]: use the dbus bindings for notifications
; [[rcircOthmar]]: replace the text of /dim user's speech with nonsense
; [[rcircDisplayChannels]]: Display all open channel buffers (or query buffers) at once
; [[rcircRandomNames]]: change all the nicks to random names
; [[rcircCloudToButt]]: Replace "cloud" with "butt" and other idiocy

rcirc can highlight the channels in the mode line only when your nick is mentioned in them. Use the following code snippet:

<pre>
(rcirc-track-minor-mode 1)

(setq neale/rcirc-ignored-channels
      '(
	"#emacs" "#guile" "#guix" "#lisp" "#scheme" "#rcirc"
	))

(defun neale/rcirc-print-function (process sender response target text)
  (if (not (eq target nil))
      (with-current-buffer (rcirc-get-buffer process target)
        (cond
         ((and (equal sender (rcirc-nick process))
               (equal response "JOIN"))
          (rcirc-omit-mode)
          (when (member target neale/rcirc-ignored-channels)
            (setq rcirc-ignore-buffer-activity-flag t)))))))

(add-hook 'rcirc-print-functions 'neale/rcirc-print-function)
</pre>

==Questions & Answers==

[new]
[[VincentFoley]] asks: could anyone describe the differences between rcirc and ERC from an end-user point of view?

[new]
AlexSchroeder replies: For beginners, there should be no significant differences. After all, both claim to be easy-to-use IRC clients. The differences begin when customizing or hacking it. Neither of the two has introduced radical changes to the user interface.

WeakishJiang: I have not used ERC. But I found this piece on [[InternetRelayChat|this page]]:

[quote]
I used ERC for a while, but I was not very fond of the 20 odd files required in 
my elisp directory, so I switched to rcirc and haven’t looked back since. It does
everything I need, the (very clean) code is contained in a single file, I’m very happy!
