Emacs's built-in ispell package handles spell-checking and correction, while flyspell provides on-the-fly checking and highlighting of misspellings.

== Installing a spell checker ==

Emacs supports three spelling checkers by default: Hunspell, which is now widely used by popular free software such as LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird; GNU Aspell, which pays particular attention to quality of suggestions, and the original Ispell. If no spell checker is manually configured, Emacs will choose aspell over hunspell over ispell.

=== Hunspell ===

[http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/ Hunspell] is a widely-used free software spelling checker, and supports a wider range of languages than others. It has many [http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries dictionaries].

The ELPA package [http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/rw-hunspell rw-hunspell] provides some useful extensions to ispell.el for Hunspell.

On my linux setup I use the following:
<pre>
(require 'rw-language-and-country-codes)
(require 'rw-ispell)
(require 'rw-hunspell)
(setq ispell-dictionary "da_DK_hunspell")
;; The following is set via custom
(custom-set-variables
 '(rw-hunspell-default-dictionary "da_DK_hunspell")
 '(rw-hunspell-dicpath-list (quote ("/usr/share/hunspell")))
 '(rw-hunspell-make-dictionary-menu t)
 '(rw-hunspell-use-rw-ispell t)
)
</pre>


[:Hunspell]
=== Hunspell, no external package ===

The code below comes from http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/86554/make-hunspell-work-with-emacs-and-german-language, and works for me.

<pre>
(add-to-list 'ispell-local-dictionary-alist '("deutsch-hunspell"
                                              "[[:alpha:]]"
                                              "[^[:alpha:]]"
                                              "[']"
                                              t
                                              ("-d" "de_DE"); Dictionary file name
                                              nil
                                              iso-8859-1))

(add-to-list 'ispell-local-dictionary-alist '("english-hunspell"
                                              "[[:alpha:]]"
                                              "[^[:alpha:]]"
                                              "[']"
                                              t
                                              ("-d" "en_US")
                                              nil
                                              iso-8859-1))

(setq ispell-program-name "hunspell"          ; Use hunspell to correct mistakes
      ispell-dictionary   "deutsch-hunspell") ; Default dictionary to use
</pre>


[:GnuAspell]
=== GNU Aspell ===

[http://aspell.net/ Aspell] was originally designed as a replacement for Ispell; its primary advantage today is the quality of its suggested replacements. This is particularly useful when used with flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word, where you can iterate through suggested spellings -- it's much more useful when the correct spelling is near the head of the list.

Aspell is a lot slower than Ispell; on modern machines, this probably doesn't matter, but if you find editing is sluggish with flyspell-mode using Aspell, you can speed it up at the cost of reducing the quality of its suggestions with:

    (setq ispell-extra-args '("--sug-mode=fast"))


[:Ispell]
=== Ispell ===

[http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html Ispell], short for "international spell", is a successor of the original "spell" spelling program. The main reason to use it is if it has a better dictionary (or any dictionary) for the language you want to check.

You can get the binary and lots of dictionaries from the home page; here are direct links to a german dictionary 
 [http://www.j3e.de/ispell/igerman98/dict/]
and a french dictionary
[http://www.gutenberg.eu.org/distributions/16-installation.html].
The files contain installation instructions.

== Using ispell.el ==

The list of installed dictionaries can be obtained by typing

  M-x ispell-change-dictionary RET SPC

or by typing
 
  M-: (ispell-valid-dictionary-list) RET

Or by browsing the menu <code>Tools > Spell-checking > Change Dictionary</code>
and typing SPC in minibuffer when asked.

You can specify which dictionary to use at startup by putting in your InitFile

  (setq ispell-dictionary "german")

If you want to use the english dictionary in a particular buffer instead, 
put the following on the first line of the buffer

  -*- ispell-dictionary: "english" -*-

Here are some extensions to <code>ispell.el</code>:

* [http://user42.tuxfamily.org/ispell-stopwords/index.html ispell-stopwords.el] -- use Perl POD <code>=for stopwords</code> per-file words list

=== Manual installation of a dictionary ===

Here is some code for your ~/.emacs that makes a new dictionary
available to `ispell-change-dictionary'.  This dictionary is a
variation of the German dictionary and is called "swiss".  The
appropriate entry to the <em>Tools / Spell Checking</em> menu is added
as well.

    (require 'ispell)
    (add-to-list 'ispell-dictionary-alist
                 '("swiss"
                   "[a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]"
                   "[^a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]"
                   "[']" t ("-C" "-d" "swiss") "~latin1" iso-8859-1))
    (defun my-ispell-swiss-dictionary ()
      "Switch to the Swiss dictionary."
      (interactive)
      (ispell-change-dictionary "swiss"))
    (require 'easymenu)
    (easy-menu-add-item  nil '("tools" "spell")
      ["Select Swiss Dict" my-ispell-swiss-dictionary t])

ispell must be required before adding to the Spell Checking menu, because loading it resets the
menu.

If you ever need to produce the list of octal escapes yourself, use
something like the following:

    (insert
     (mapconcat (lambda (c) (format "\\%o" (multibyte-char-to-unibyte c)))
                "äöüÄÖÜ" ""))

=== Changing dictionaries automatically ===

Customize the variable `ispell-message-dictionary-alist' if you want
to switch dictionary according to some header when you use
`ispell-message'.

Other than that, take a look at WikiSpell.  It has code that uses
GuessBufferLanguage and chooses a dictionary accordingly.

Other modes for that are GuessLang and AutoLangMode.

=== Speck Mode ==
A third way to use emacs is with SpeckMode which is an alternative to iSpell.

=== Wcheck Mode ===

WcheckMode is a fast general-purpose on-the-fly (spell-)checker interface which can use external programs or Emacs Lisp functions as the text-checker engine. It works not only with Ispell, Enchant, Hunspell etc. but also many other command-line text-filtering programs and shell scripts. Wcheck mode is highly configurable.

([http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/ Enchant] is a wrapper for ispell, aspell, hunspell, myspell, voikko, zemberek, etc. An advantage of using it is that it can be configured to use different spelling checkers according to the language, and that, since it is used by other programs, such as AbiWord and LyX, that configuration can be useful outside Emacs.)

=== Checking multiple buffers/files in dired ===

{{{
(defun dired-do-ispell (&optional arg)
  (interactive "P")
  (dolist (file (dired-get-marked-files
                 nil arg
                 #'(lambda (f)
                     (not (file-directory-p f)))))
    (save-window-excursion
      (with-current-buffer (find-file file)
        (ispell-buffer)))
    (message nil)))
}}}

=== Spell-checking with curly quotes as apostrophes ===

If you use TypographicalPunctuationMarks you may find you get spelling errors for words like "isn’t". To fix this, you need to tell Emacs that the extra characters you use are allowed in words. Customize ispell-local-dictionary-alist, and add, for example:

{{{
(quote (("british" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "['’]" t ("-d" "en_GB") nil utf-8)))
}}}

Note the curly quote in the (short) list of non-letter characters allowed in words.
