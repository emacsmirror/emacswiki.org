ispell.el is an Emacs interface to the ispell binary.

* ispell.el homepage -- http://kdstevens.com/~stevens/ispell-page.html

You need ispell installed if you want to use ispell.el.  You need ispell dictionaries installed if you actually want to use the program.  Usually the binary is distributed with an American and a British dictionary, one of them linked the to the default English dictionary.

You can get the binary and lots of dictionaries from the official homepage:

* International Ispell homepage -- http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html

Here are direct links to a german dictionary 
 [http://www.j3e.de/ispell/igerman98/dict/]
and a french dictionary
[http://www.gutenberg.eu.org/distributions/16-installation.html].
The files contain installation instructions.

The list of installed dictionaries can be obtained by typing

  M-x ispell-change-dictionary RET SPC

or by typing
 
  M-: (ispell-valid-dictionary-list) RET

Or by browsing the menu <code>Tools > Spell-checking > Change Dictionary</code>
and typing SPC in minibuffer when asked.

You can specify which dictionary to use at startup by putting in your InitFile

  (setq ispell-dictionary "german")

If you want to use the english dictionary in a particular buffer instead, 
put the following on the first line of the buffer

  -*- ispell-dictionary: "english" -*-

Here are some things extending <code>ispell.el</code>,

== Manual install of a dictionary ==

Here is some code for your ~/.emacs that makes a new dictionary
available to `ispell-change-dictionary'.  This dictionary is a
variation of the German dictionary and is called "swiss".  The
appropriate entry to the <em>Tools / Spell Checking</em> menu is added
as well.

    (require 'ispell)
    (add-to-list 'ispell-dictionary-alist
                 '("swiss"
                   "[a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]"
                   "[^a-zA-Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374]"
                   "[']" t ("-C" "-d" "swiss") "~latin1" iso-8859-1))
    (defun my-ispell-swiss-dictionary ()
      "Switch to the Swiss dictionary."
      (interactive)
      (ispell-change-dictionary "swiss"))
    (require 'easymenu)
    (easy-menu-add-item  nil '("tools" "spell")
      ["Select Swiss Dict" my-ispell-swiss-dictionary t])

You need to require ispell, because loading ispell will modify the
Spell Checking menu, so additions to the menu will be lost when ispell
is loaded.

If you ever need to produce the list of octal escapes yourself, use
something like the following for each character:

    (format "%o" (multibyte-char-to-unibyte ?ç))

Or all in one:

    (insert
     (mapconcat (lambda (c) (format "\\%o" (multibyte-char-to-unibyte c)))
                "äöüÄÖÜ" ""))

== Changing dictionaries automatically ==

Customize the variable `ispell-message-dictionary-alist' if you want
to switch dictionary according to some header when you use
`ispell-message'.

Other than that, take a look at WikiSpell.  It has code that uses
GuessBufferLanguage and chooses a dictionary accordingly.

Other modes for that are GuessLang and AutoLangMode.

== Using Another Spelling-Program ==

=== Hunspell ===

[http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/ Hunspell] is the spell checker in openofffice, firefox, and many other programs, as noted in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell wikipedia], and this consensus makes it the best for emacs too! Hunspell has many [http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries dictionaries]. For certain languages such as Swedish, it can handle complex rules that aspell cannot.

The simplest way to setup Hunspell: Install Hunspell on your system. It is available via linux package managers. Install [http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/rw-hunspell rw-hunspell] via elpa, then add the following to your init file. Restart emacs, and you are good to go. 

  (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell")
  (require 'rw-hunspell)

Alternate, more complex hunspell setups

[new]
One complete setup is at http://email.esm.psu.edu/pipermail/macosx-emacs/2008-May/000431.html

[new]
Another setup:
<pre>
(setq
   ispell-dictionary-alist
   '((nil				; default 
      "[A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[^A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[\"]"
      nil ("-d" "/Users/username/.enchant/myspell/nn_NO") nil utf-8)
     ("nynorsk"
      "[A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[^A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[\"]"
      nil ("-d" "/Users/username/.enchant/myspell/nn_NO") nil utf-8)
     ("bokmål"
      "[A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[^A-Za-zçéêèóôòæøåÇÉÊÈÓÔÒÆØÅ]" "[\"]"
      nil ("-d" "/Users/username/.enchant/myspell/nb_NO") nil utf-8)))
(eval-after-load "ispell"
    (progn
      (setq ispell-dictionary "nynorsk"
	    ispell-extra-args '("-a" "-i" "utf-8") ; aspell doesn't understand -i utf-8, hunspell needs it
	    ispell-silently-savep t)))
(setq-default ispell-program-name "hunspell"))
</pre>

(Where <code>/Users/username/.enchant/myspell/</code> contains nb_NO.dic and nb_NO.aff etc.) However, to use my English dictionaries, I have to switch back to aspell and change the dictionary-alist, which is a hassle... I'd rather figure out how to use enchant.

[new]
I have to change <code>ispell-dictionary-alist</code> to <code>ispell-dictionary-base-alist</code> to change de dictionary list.  To make it work the 1st time, I also have to remove the <code>"-a"</code> from ispell-extra-args (actually, I have it as nil).

Another possibility is to use rw-hunspell by Ralf Wachinger. rw-hunspell, rw-ispell and rw-language-and-country-codes can be found [[http://www.mail-archive.com/gnu-emacs-sources@gnu.org/msg01709.html|here]].
On my linux setup I use the following:
<pre>
;; Use hunspell instead of ispell
(setq ispell-program-name "hunspell") 
(require 'rw-language-and-country-codes)
(require 'rw-ispell)
(require 'rw-hunspell)
(setq ispell-dictionary "da_DK_hunspell")
;; The following is set via custom
(custom-set-variables
 '(rw-hunspell-default-dictionary "da_DK_hunspell")
 '(rw-hunspell-dicpath-list (quote ("/usr/share/hunspell")))
 '(rw-hunspell-make-dictionary-menu t)
 '(rw-hunspell-use-rw-ispell t)
)
</pre>
In windows I use the following. Make sure that hunspell is in the path.
<pre>
(setq ispell-program-name "hunspell.exe") 
(require 'rw-language-and-country-codes)
(require 'rw-ispell)
(require 'rw-hunspell)
(setq ispell-dictionary "da_DK_hunspell") ;the _suffix is the same as the name of the final dicpath directory

;; The following is set via custom
(custom-set-variables
 '(rw-hunspell-dicpath-list '("C:/Program Files/hunspell/")) ;spaces or special characters may be problematic
 '(rw-hunspell-make-dictionary-menu t)
 '(rw-hunspell-use-rw-ispell t)
)
</pre>


=== Aspell ===
You might be interested in using a different spell checker. In
particular, Aspell is a fairly new replacement for much of Ispell's
functionality. Fortunately, using Aspell with Emacs is very easy:

    (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")

Flyspell uses "-l" with ispell for faster region checking. The equivalent aspell command is "list":

    (setq ispell-list-command "list")

The %%*Flyspell-region%%* buffer will contain the message 'Error: You must specify a parameter for "-l".' when aspell fails because this parameter is not set.

(Aspell has an Ispell-emulation mode, so it behaves like ispell.el expects.)

For lots more information on Aspell, see the Aspell website:

* http://aspell.net/

Compared with Ispell, Aspell is much better at coming up with suggested spellings, and at putting them in likely order.  This is particularly useful when used with flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word, where you can iterate through suggested spellings -- it's much more useful when the correct spelling is near the head of the list.

The problem with using aspell with flyspell is that in its default mode, it it a *lot* slower than ispell.  Fortunately, you can tell it to speed up, though this reduces somewhat the quality of its suggestions.  So try this:

    (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")
    (setq ispell-extra-args '("--sug-mode=ultra"))

According to the aspell documentation, "ultra" is the fastest mode, which is still twice as slow as ispell; but I don't notice the difference from ispell on my machine.  If your machine is fast enough, a better option might be to try "fast" mode, which is twice as slow as "ultra", but more accurate.  The "normal" mode, which is the aspell default, is even more accurate, but is reportedly 10 times slower than "fast" mode, and on my machine it makes editing and motion around the buffer noticeably sluggish when in flyspell-mode.  YMMV, depending on how fast your machine is, and how big your word-lists are.


=== Speck Mode ==
A third way to use emacs is with SpeckMode which is an alternative to iSpell.

=== Wcheck Mode ===

WcheckMode is a fast general-purpose on-the-fly (spell-)checker interface which can use external programs or Emacs Lisp functions as the text-checker engine. It works not only with Ispell, Enchant, Hunspell etc. but also many other command-line text-filtering programs and shell scripts. Wcheck mode is highly configurable.

=== Enchant ===
[http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/ Enchant] is a wrapper for ispell, aspell, hunspell, myspell, voikko, zemberek, etc. 

==Questions==

=== Checking multiple buffers/files ===
[new] Question: Any easy way to spell-check multiple buffers/files ? Any integration with Dired ?

[new] That can be done :
{{{

(defun dired-do-ispell (&optional arg)
  (interactive "P")
  (dolist (file (dired-get-marked-files
                 nil arg
                 #'(lambda (f)
                     (not (file-directory-p f)))))
    (save-window-excursion
      (with-current-buffer (find-file file)
        (ispell-buffer)))
    (message nil)))

}}}

=== Making Ispell.el English work with "foreign" character ===
[new] Question: How can one make ispell work with foreign characters, i.e. æøå, when the dictionary is set to English?
For example, using emacs 24.0.50.1 (bzr) with no .emacs, only evaluating the following
{{{
   (setq ispell-really-hunspell t)
}}}
and running ispell on a buffer containing
{{{
   house jærger
}}}
one will get the following error
{{{
   Ispell error: UTF-8 encoding error. Missing continuation byte in 0. character position:
}}}
The problem is further described [http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.help/browse_thread/thread/f230b20f1cd1a84f here]
Note: When running hunspell from the terminal there is no problem with "foreign" characters. Also setting
{{{
   (setq ispell-extra-args '("-a" "-i" "utf-8"))
}}}
does not change anything.
