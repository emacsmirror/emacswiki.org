*Note:* Long Lines is obsolete and has been replaced by VisualFillColumn.

Long Lines is a [[minor mode]] that helps you edit text files that have long lines.

Lines are separated by [[line ending]] characters. When you hit the Return key (`RET') or the equivalent, a line ending is inserted. A line ending is also called a '''[[hard return]]'''.

Long Lines mode visually wraps long lines, to fill text and prevent
lines from running off the screen. This wrapping is a display effect. It works by inserting line-ending characters temporarily. These visual line separations are called '''[::soft return]s'''. Soft returns are removed when text is copied to the [[kill ring]] or the [[buffer]] is saved to disk.

This means that, ultimately, the text in a file you edit is changed only by hard returns (the returns that you insert manually), not by soft returns (which are inserted temporarily for visual wrapping).

You can download it here: Lisp:longlines.el. This version was maintained to be compatible with older Emacs versions
and with XEmacs.)

By default, soft returns are automatically inserted as you edit, to keep your text wrapped. If you do not want this effect, set
`longlines-auto-wrap' to `nil'. You can still type
`M-q', or use any of the other fill [[command]]s, to fill text using soft returns (see FillParagraph.)

If you invoke command `longlines-show-hard-newlines' or set
[[variable]] `longlines-show-hard-newlines' to non-`nil', then 
hard returns are marked with a glyph. This makes typing errors
easier to spot.

Long Lines mode does not lengthen short lines. It does not remove line endings (hard returns); it only (visually) wraps long lines.

If `longlines-wrap-follows-window-size' is non-`nil', then Long Lines mode uses the window size as the wrap limit, instead of `fill-column'.

Long Lines mode was originally written by AlexSchroeder and KaiGrossjohann.
