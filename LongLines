(Note: GnuEmacs 23.1 now has word-wrapping built into the redisplay engine. Use visual-line-mode to turn it on. See [[LineWrap]] for more information. Long Lines has been removed from GnuEmacs 24.4.)

Long Lines [[minor mode]] helps you edit text files that have long lines.

Lines are separated by [[line ending]] characters. When you hit the Return key (`RET') or the equivalent, a line ending is inserted. A line ending is also called a '''[[hard return]]'''.

Long Lines mode visually wraps long lines, to fill text and prevent
lines from running off the screen. This wrapping is a display effect. It works by inserting line-ending characters temporarily. These visual line separations are called '''[::soft return]s'''. Soft returns are removed when text is copied to the [[kill ring]] or the [[buffer]] is saved to disk.

This means that, ultimately, the text in a file you edit is changed only by hard returns (the returns that you insert manually), not by soft returns (which are inserted temporarily for visual wrapping).

GnuEmacs 22 and later come with Long Lines mode.  For other versions of Emacs, you can download it here: Lisp:longlines.el. (Do not take the version of ##longlines.el## from Emacs CVS and dump it into
an older Emacs version; it's not compatible.  The version of ##longlines.el##
in the ElispArea (Lisp:longlines.el) is maintained to be compatible with older Emacs versions
and with XEmacs.)

By default, soft returns are automatically inserted as you edit, to keep your text wrapped. If you do not want this effect, set
`longlines-auto-wrap' to `nil'. You can still type
`M-q', or use any of the other fill [[command]]s, to fill text using soft returns (see FillParagraph.)

If you invoke command `longlines-show-hard-newlines' or set
[[variable]] `longlines-show-hard-newlines' to non-`nil', then 
hard returns are marked with a glyph. This makes typing errors
easier to spot.

Long Lines mode does not lengthen short lines. It does not remove line endings (hard returns); it only (visually) wraps long lines.

If you want to remove hard returns and then let Long Lines mode handle line wrapping, you can do this:

# Use `C-u 99999 C-x f' to set variable `fill-column' to 99999.
# Use command `fill-region' to fill all paragraphs in the [[region]]. Or use `M-q' (`fill-paragraph') on individual paragraphs to fill them. See also commands `fill-individual-paragraphs', `fill-nonuniform-paragraphs', and `fill-region-as-paragraph'.

If `longlines-wrap-follows-window-size' is non-`nil', then Long Lines mode uses the window size as the wrap limit, instead of `fill-column'.

Long Lines mode was originally written by AlexSchroeder and KaiGrossjohann.
