[[ja:EmacsClient-ja]]
EmacsClient allows one to open a file for editing in an already running Emacs.  Because it doesn't start a new Emacs instance at each invocation, you can set up EmacsClient as the default editor, e.g. in the environment variable EDITOR or VISUAL.  EmacsClient is part of and works only in conjunction with GNU Emacs.  The program GnuClient provides the corresponding functionality for XEmacs, but also works with GnuEmacs.

= Start the Emacs Server =

=== Starting Interactively ===
To enable the Emacs server, add the command 

   (server-start) 

to your init.el.  This is a requirement for using the Emacs client! When the server is running, closing the last Emacs frame will leave the server running. To shut Emacs down completely, call the command `(kill-emacs)'. 

=== Emacs Daemon ===

The command 

 emacs --daemon

will launch an emacs in daemon mode, starting the server, running the init files and then detaching into the background. This is handy for automatically running at launch. This can save you a few seconds since Emacs will already be running by the time you open your first file! This was not supported on Windows before version 25. 

EmacsAsDaemon details various ways to run this command in different distributions, init scripts vs systemd and so on.


= Using EmacsClient =

=== Terminal environment ===

Simply replace every place you'd run <tt>emacs</tt> with this command instead. 

{{{
emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor=""
}}}

The emacsclient program will connect to a running instance of Emacs if it exists. <tt>-c</tt> tells Emacs to open the file in a new frame, which is optional. 
 Specifying <tt>-a=""</tt> tells emacsclient to start an instance of emacs if it cannot find one already running.


To use emacsclient as your editor, add the following to your .bashrc:

{{{
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""
export EDITOR="emacsclient -t"                  # $EDITOR opens in terminal
export VISUAL="emacsclient -c -a emacs"         # $VISUAL opens in GUI mode
}}}

If you prefer to launch GUI Emacs from your terminal when editing files, replace the <tt>-t</tt> in the second line with <tt>-c</tt>

=== Desktop Environment ===

You can install a desktop entry for Emacsclient. This will make it available in context menus in Gnome, KDE, XFCE, and other Freedesktop environments. Create a file named emacsclient.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications containing the following:

{{{
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Emacs (Client)
GenericName=Text Editor
Comment=Edit text
MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
Exec=emacsclient -с -a "emacs" %F
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;TextEditor;Utility;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
}}}





=== Windows ===

See EmacsMsWindowsIntegration for a fairly complete and workable solution for Emacs 23/24, using stock Emacs builds. EmacsMsWindowsIntegration contains info on how to set up taskbar/Start-menu shortcuts and make Emacs open particular file types using emacsclient.  

See MsWindowsGlobalContextMenu to add Emacs client to the right click context menu in Explorer. 

WThirtyTwoFileAssociations to see how to associate file extensions to open with Emacs client on Windows. 

ExternalDotExe shows a way to edit text fields in many applications with Emacs client.


= Custom commands and configurations =


====Using emacsclient to make a new frame of a remote Emacs 22 on a local display:====

    ssh -Y remote_host -f emacsclient --eval '"(make-frame-on-display \"$DISPLAY\")"'

====Edit in a new frame or in the current frame====

Open a new frame from your shell by adding to your .bashrc or .zshrc

   new-frame() {
      emacsclient -e "(new-frame)"
   }


====Tiling Window Managers====

See TilingWindowManagers for info about using Emacsclient with tiling WMs.


====Making C-x k end an emacsclient session====

If your fingers are wired to using C-x k to kill off buffers (and you dont like having to type C-x #) then try this :
 
  (add-hook 'server-switch-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (current-local-map)
                (use-local-map (copy-keymap (current-local-map))))
	      (when server-buffer-clients
		(local-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'server-edit))))


====Functionality similar to kill-emacs-query-functions for clients====

`kill-emacs-query-functions' allows one to call functions that query the user about killing emacs, with the potential for aborting the quit.  i have a simple check in my .emacs that works fine for a standalone emacs process but doesn't get called when exiting an emacs client.

 (setq kill-emacs-query-functions
      (cons (lambda () (yes-or-no-p "Really kill Emacs? "))
            kill-emacs-query-functions))

====Using Emacsclient with Gnu Screen====
See here: GnuScreen


====Opening Server Files Always in a New Frame====

To open the files designated by emacsclient in their own frame, you can use the following hook as a Server Switch Hook which can be set up in customize-group <RET> Server <RET>, or in your InitFile, as such:

    (add-hook 'server-switch-hook
              (lambda nil
                (let ((server-buf (current-buffer)))
                  (bury-buffer)
                  (switch-to-buffer-other-frame server-buf))))

If you're setting this up via M-x customize, you'll of course want to drop the  (add-hook) call.

You might also want to close the frame when you're done with it. To do this, set up a Server Done Hook in the same section to call delete-frame.

    (add-hook 'server-done-hook 'delete-frame)

I also like emacs to cleanup stuff when I finish the emacsclient, so I add another hook to kill the buffer when finished. This also takes care of weird buffer switching behaviors when closing client buffers.

    (add-hook 'server-done-hook (lambda nil (kill-buffer nil)))

The whole thing is actually in my ##.emacs-custom## file:

  (custom-set-variables
   '(server-done-hook (quote ((lambda nil (kill-buffer nil)) delete-frame)))
   '(server-switch-hook (quote ((lambda nil (let (server-buf) (setq server-buf (current-buffer)) (bury-buffer)      (switch-to-buffer-other-frame server-buf))))))
   )

--TheAnarcat

You can also use `server-kill-new-buffers' instead of calling `kill-buffer' in
your `server-done-hook', e.g.

    (custom-set-variables '(server-kill-new-buffers t))
    (add-hook 'server-done-hook (lambda () (delete-frame)))

===Setting Up emacsclient to Run Emacs Only on X11===

I've found it very useful to set my $EDITOR to emacsclient, and let it judge wether or not to start emacs, based on the $DISPLAY variable, which is often an indication of running on a faster machine for me. So I've wrote the following script, and installed it as /usr/bin/emacsclient.vim.

<pre>
#! /bin/sh

files="$@"
files=${files:-/dev/zero}

if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ]; then
  exec emacsclient.emacs21 -a vim "$files"
else
  exec emacsclient.emacs21 -a emacs "$files"
fi
</pre>

Note that I avoided calling directly emacsclient, which might be an alternative that points to emacsclient.vim, which would lead to an horrible recursion.

To complete the setup on Debian, I've installed this script as an alternative to the editor command:

<pre>
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor /usr/bin/emacsclient.vim 50
</pre>

Now I can choose emacsclient.vim as my editor using:

<pre>
update-alternatives --config editor
</pre>

===Piping stdout to an Emacs buffer using emacsclient===

See EmacsPipe.

===Nifty shell function for hassle-free starting of emacsclient===
This is aimed at users that use GUI.

* It creates a new frame if it doesn't exist or opens the given file in the existing frame.
* The function has a built-in EmacsPipe functionality (e.g. <code>echo "foo" | em -</code>).
* Both GUI and TUI instances can be created without issues. For TUI just use <code>-nw</code>, <code>-t</code> or <code>--tty</code> switch like you would normally.

<pre>
em()
{
    args=""
    nw=false
    # check if emacsclient is already running
    if pgrep -U $(id -u) emacsclient > /dev/null; then running=true; fi

    # check if the user wants TUI mode
    for arg in "$@"; do
    	if [ "$arg" = "-nw" ] || [ "$arg" = "-t" ] || [ "$arg" = "--tty" ]
	then
    	    nw=true
    	fi
    done

    # if called without arguments - open a new gui instance
    if [ "$#" -eq "0" ] || [ "$running" != true ]; then
	args=(-c $args) 		# open emacsclient in a new window
    fi
    if [ "$#" -gt "0" ]; then
	# if 'em -' open standard input (e.g. pipe)
	if [[ "$1" == "-" ]]; then
    	    TMP="$(mktemp /tmp/emacsstdin-XXX)"
    	    cat >$TMP
	    args=($args --eval '(let ((b (generate-new-buffer "*stdin*"))) (switch-to-buffer b) (insert-file-contents "'${TMP}'") (delete-file "'${TMP}'"))')
	else
	    args=($@ $args)
	fi
    fi

    # emacsclient $args
    if $nw; then
	emacsclient "${args[@]}"
    else
	(nohup emacsclient "${args[@]}" > /dev/null 2>&1 &) > /dev/null
    fi
}
</pre>

== Setting frame colors differently for graphical clients and console clients ==

See: SettingFrameColorsForEmacsClient

-- GeoffreyTeale

== Color coding (multiple) emacs server instances ==

You can start different emacs server instances w/ different color schemes (so you instantly know which one your using).

This works to set the background color:

<pre>
emacs --daemon=todo --background-color='#93DB80'
emacs --daemon=edit --background-color=yellow
</pre>

But if you try setting the cursor color -- it fails miserably.

Another, more flexible option:

=== starting emacs server (daemon) ===
Example scripts for starting different instances of emacs server:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

export ESRVNAME=todo
emacs --daemon=$ESRVNAME
</pre>
or
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

export ESRVNAME=edit
emacs --daemon=$ESRVNAME
ps -ef | grep -i 'emacs --daemon'
</pre>

Also see http://www.gnu.org/s/libtool/manual/emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server

=== set color choices in .emacs ===
Set your color choices in your .emacs file:
<pre>
;; set colors for my emacs server instances
(when (string-match "todo" server-name)
  (setq default-frame-alist
        (append default-frame-alist
                '((background-color . "#93DB80")
                  (cursor-color . "yellow")
                  )))
  ;; or set a color-theme, e.g., (color-theme-classic)
  )
(when (string-match "edit" server-name)
  (setq default-frame-alist
        (append default-frame-alist
                '((background-color . "yellow")
                  ;; (foreground-color . "black")
                  (cursor-color . "blue")
                  )))
  )
</pre>

=== starting emacsclient ===
An example script for starting emacsclient (for different instances of emacs server):
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

emacsclient -server-file edit -c "$@"
</pre>

This allows you to pass any parameters to emacsclient, e.g., filenames, or even the '-t' (or '-nw') option (it will override the '-c')

Another example:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

umask 0007 # you can set a different umask than your default for emcas session
cd ~/docs/todo/
emacsclient -server-file todo -c ~/docs/todo/work.org &
</pre>

= Web Browser Plugins = 

The Emacs server can be used to edit text fields in web browsers using plugins.

===== Extension for webextension-compatible browsers: Edit with Emacs =====
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/edit-with-emacs1|Edit with Emacs] is an extension for webextension-compatible browsers such as GNU Icecat, Mozilla Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.
This extension allows users to edit web-page TEXTAREAs with Emacs.  It's nice to use Emacs when typing in posts or editing Wiki pages.  It uses its own edit-server.el instead of emacsclient or gnuclient currently, and doesn't let you edit page source yet.  //(This is not strictly about emacsclient, but seems related.)//

===== Discontinued Firefox extensions =====

/It's All Text/ and  /MozEx/ cannot be found on the Firefox add-ons store and seem to have been discontinued.

= Troubleshooting = 

"No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"

The #1 problem people face is a stale or outdated server file. Just rm ~/.emacs.d/server/* and your problem is usually solved. 




== workaround for emacsclient "can't find socket" error on cocoa/ns build (OS X) via ssh ==

I find that after starting emacs server (eg, /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon) I can start a client session locally, but emacsclient can't find the socket if I try to create a terminal-only client via ssh (OS X 10.6.2, GNU Emacs 23.1.90.1 compiled with ./configure --with-ns). I've seen this reported as a bug (bug#3992: 23.1.50) on bug-gnu-emacs-gnu. Here's a workaround. 

First, you need to make sure that you're using the right emacsclient binary.  Apple distributes GNU Emacs 22 (installed in /usr/bin), but its emacsclient binary is not compatible with GNU Emacs 23.

<pre>
alias emacsclient="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient"
</pre>

Then, you need to set the server-socket-dir variable in your .emacs so that the standard path assumed by emacsclient is used instead of the path that Emacs 23 defaults to on MacOS X.

<pre>
(setq server-socket-dir (format "/tmp/emacs%d" (user-uid)))
</pre>

Obviously, this needs to be executed before (server-start) is called.

Now you can attach to the server process using the above alias in terminal mode via an ssh session:

 emacsclient -nw

And it also works locally to launch the cocoa GUI:

 emacsclient -c &

I expect that this will fail if you are running multiple servers.

= KDE =
In KDE, you can set File Associations to open in emacsclient instead of KWrite.


= Socket forwarding with OpenSSH =

The OpenSSH implementation of the ssh client and server can forward Unix sockets. It's possible
to use this to connect to a remote Emacs server.

<pre>
local$ ssh -R /tmp/emacs-server:/tmp/emacs$UID/server remote
remote$ mkdir /tmp/emacs$UID
remote$ mv /tmp/emacs-server /tmp/emacs$UID/server
remote$ export EDITOR="emacsclient --tramp=/ssh:remote:"
</pre>




= Convenient wrappers around emacsclient =

All my personal aliases and scripts start with a comma.  <COMMA>-<TAB> in the shell gives a complete list.  These convenience-wrappers are especially handy with a tiling window managers, such as i3.

,ecn: Loads one or several files into Emacs, opens a separate frame for each file.  Returns immediatelly.  This is what I use when I want to open a file in a fresh Emacs frame.

<pre>
$ cat `which ,ecn`
#!/bin/sh

for filename in "$@"; do
    emacsclient -n -c "$filename"
done
</pre>

,ec: Loads one or several files into Emacs, opens a separate frame for each file.  Does not return until the user closes the frame with C-x #.  My environment variable $VISUAL is set to ,ec.  The main use is editing commit messages.

<pre>
$ cat `which ,ec`
#!/bin/sh

for filename in "$@"; do
    emacsclient -c "$filename"
done
</pre>


,es: Loads one or several files into Emacs, opens no frames.  Returns immediatelly.  Once the file(s) is/are loaded, once can reuse an existing Emacs frame to select the appropriate buffer or press <F12> to open the buffer of the last file loaded by ,es.  For this to work it is necessary to add the following lines to .emacs:

<pre>
(defun load-last-file ()
  "Load file from variable _lastfile_ set by ,es script."
  (interactive)
  (find-file _lastfile_))
(global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") 'load-last-file)
</pre>

<pre>
$ cat `which ,es`
#!/usr/bin/env perl

sub to_emacs_string
{
  s/\\/\\\\/g;
  s/"/\\"/g;

  return qq{"$_"};
}

$lst = join " ", map(to_emacs_string, @ARGV);

$_ = `readlink -f $ARGV[-1]`;
chomp;
$f = to_emacs_string;

exec "emacsclient", "-e", "(progn (setq _lastfile_ $f) (setq lst '($lst)) (while lst (find-file-noselect (car lst)) (setq lst (cdr lst))))";
</pre>
