;;; Commentary:

;; Fetch a file from a java hierarchy. Simply highlight the class name,
;; and type M-x fetch. Fetch will walk your current package looking for the
;; class, and if it finds it will open the file in a new buffer.

;; Another library named `fetch.el' exists which does something completely different.
;; It used to be available at http://gnufans.net/~deego/emacspub/lisp-mine/fetch/.

;; [*] Added above not about other `fetch.el' and fixed header.

;; If you find yourself here then do yourself a favor and read about etags.
;; That's essentially what I had attempted to achieve with this program ...

;;; Code:

(defconst *fetch-step* 5000)

;; Bump up the max-specpdl-size and max-lisp-eval-depth vars if they 
;; are too low. (Called interactively for debugging purposes)
(defun fetch-bump-it-up-a-notch ()
  (interactive)
  (setq max-specpdl-size (+ max-specpdl-size *fetch-step*))
  (setq max-lisp-eval-depth (+ max-lisp-eval-depth *fetch-step*))
  (message "Bumped it up a notch"))

;; Isolate and return the currently marked text.
(defun fetch-marked-text (start end)
  (let ((text (buffer-substring-no-properties start end)))
    text))

;; Fetch all the text, up to the initial public|private|protected
;; declaration, from this buffer without adornments.
(defun fetch-all-text ()
  (save-excursion
    (set-window-point (get-buffer-window (buffer-name)) 1)
    (let* ((end (re-search-forward "^.*\\(public\\|private\\|protected\\)"))
	   (text (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) end)))
      text)))

;; Break the current buffer into a list of lines
(defun fetch-all-lines ()
  (let ((lines (split-string (fetch-all-text) "[\r\n]+")))
    lines))

;; Extract only lines of text that match a regexp
(defun fetch-some-lines (regexp lines)
  (if (null lines)

  (let ((res '()))
    (do ((lines lines (cdr lines)))

      (let ((line (car lines)))
	(if (string-match regexp line)
	    (setq res (append res (list line))))))))

;; Build a path upwards n directories
(defun fetch-upwards-path (n)

;; Find the document root for the working classpath
(defun fetch-document-root ()
  (let ((package (fetch-some-lines "^package" (fetch-all-lines))))
    (if (null package)

(defun fetch (start end)
