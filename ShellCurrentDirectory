;;; Commentary
;; To use this, put shell-current-directory.el somewhere on your load-path.  
;; Then add this to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'shell-current-directory)
;;
;; Then whenever you want to open a shell in the same directory as the buffer
;; you are visiting, simply type: M-x shell-current-directory
