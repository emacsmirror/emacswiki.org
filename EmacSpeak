[[es:EmacsHabla(Emacspeak)]]
EmacSpeak is a *text-to-speech* environment for Emacs. It uses modern techniques
to read the contents of the buffer using a *speech synthesizer*. It is helpful
for visually-impaired users.

[[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ Homepage]]

== Overview ==

Emacspeak implements special features for nearly every widespread mode.
See the [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/applications.html Applications List]] for details.

== Installation ==

An alternative guide is available in [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/Quick-Installation.html the manual]].

* A computer running Linux (no Windows support)
* The Emacspeak package
* A Voice Synthesizer ([[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ Espeak]] or [[https://voxin.oralux.net/prices.php Voxin]])



=== Installing Espeak ===

If ##espeak## isn't available from your package manager, download it from [[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ the espeak website]].

In your Emacspeak directory, you'll need to build the espeak server

{{{
cd servers/native-espeak
make
}}}

=== Installing Emacspeak ===

* Your package manager may have an ##emacspeak## package.
* You can get the source code from [[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ the website]]

To build from source, enter the downloaded directory and write

{{{
make config && make
}}}

=== Installing ViaVoice ===

: Note: IBM no longer distributes [[http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/ttssdk_linux.html Viavoice]]. Use espeak or voxin.

Some requirements for this setup:

* The [b]IBM <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS Runtime-kit for Linux[/b]
* The [b]IBM <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS SDK for Linux[/b]

You may try searching the Web for the above two packages.

From them, you'll need ##viavoice_tts_rtk.tar##. Getting the ##sdk.tar## file isn't necessary.

They contain ##.rpm## files, which you can install on RedHat or use [[https://wiki.debian.org/Alien Debian Alien]] to convert them to ##.deb##s:

{{{
# Perform RPM -> DEB file conversion + installation.
alien -i filename.rpm
}}}

==== The Outloud Speech Server ====

Required: ##tclx##, so on Debian, ##apt-get install tclx8.3 tclx8.3-dev## first.

The Emacspeak *Outloud speech server* allows Emacspeak to interface with <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki>. It
is in the ##servers/linux-outloud## folder in Emacspeak. The ##NOTES## file in this directory describes compilation.

: You may need to change the ##-ltcl## option in the Makefile to something like ##-ltcl8.3##.

You may have to add an *include path* so that ##tcl.h## gets found, or edit the ##tcleci.cpp## file to make the <code>#include <tcl.h></code> line fit to your systems needs. (e.g. on my system, I put ##tcl8.3/tcl.h## there).

Make and install the speech server.

You should now be able to invoke ##emacspeak -o## (##-o## calls the Outloud speech server).
Look at the emacspeak script to see how this works; basicly setting ##DTK_PROGRAM=outloud## in your shells environment should do the trick too.

Getting Auditory Icons working:

You may have noticed that the outloud speech server tries to use a /usr/bin/stdiosynth to generate auditory icons.
This will work on some systems which have /dev/synth0. My sblive doesn't have that, and so stdiosynth doesn't work.
But my sblive is multichannel capable. So I can use /dev/dsp concurrently. Here is my .emacs setup to make this work.
Be careful, it may be necessary that you use the CVS version of Emacspeak for this to work right.

 (when (featurep 'emacspeak)
   (require 'emacspeak-aumix)
   (setq emacspeak-auditory-icon-function 'emascpeak-play-auditory-icon)
   (setq emacspeak-aumix-multichannel-capable-p t)
   (emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons 1))


== Emacspeak on Windows ==

There are several packages that aim to port Emacspeak to Windows. Notes included are for ##Emacs 29## on ##Windows 11##

* [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacspeakwin emacspeakwin]] -- Throws the error ##Emacs does not seem to be working##
* [[https://github.com/serezlan/emacspeak4windows emacspeak4windows]] -- Throws the error ##No such file emacspeak-loaddefs.el##

(Further documentation needed but it's past 10PM. goodnight :3)

== For Seeing Users ==

Emacspeak is not limited to the blind. it
could be useful for all users, too. You can 
install Emacspeak and get a gratis binary only version of *viavoice*
from IBM to use it as a software speech synthesizer on your i386 linux
box. At least a *200mhz pentium* or above is recommended.
