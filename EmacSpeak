[[es:EmacsHabla(Emacspeak)]]
EmacSpeak is a *text-to-speech* environment for Emacs. It uses modern techniques
to read the contents of the buffer using a *speech synthesizer*. It is helpful
for visually-impaired users.

[[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ Homepage]]

== Overview ==

Emacspeak implements special features for nearly every widespread mode.
See the [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/applications.html Applications List]] for details.

== Installation ==

An alternative guide is available in [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/Quick-Installation.html the manual]].

* A computer running Linux (no Windows support)
* The Emacspeak package
* A Voice Synthesizer ([[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ Espeak]] or [[https://voxin.oralux.net/prices.php Voxin]])



=== Installing Espeak ===

If ##espeak## isn't available from your package manager, download it from [[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ the espeak website]].

In your Emacspeak directory, you'll need to build the espeak server

{{{
cd servers/native-espeak
make
}}}

=== Installing Emacspeak ===

* Your package manager may have an ##emacspeak## package.
* You can get the source code from [[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ the website]]

To build from source, enter the downloaded directory and write

{{{
make config && make
}}}

=== Installing ViaVoice ===

: 13 Dec 2002:  The IBM website does not appear to be offering Linux any more....

You need the IBM <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS Runtime-kit.

[[http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/ttssdk_linux.html The original download link]] is broken. Try searching for [b]"Download the <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS SDK and TTS Run Time Kit for Linux"[/b]. Note, you'll have to register, but the software itself is gratis as long as you use it non-commercially.

You'll need the file ##viavoice_tts_rtk.tar##, getting the ##sdk.tar## file isn't necessary, but could be fun for you. So maybe get both.
Those tar-files contain ##.rpm## files, which you can install on RH and maybe <nowiki>SuSE</nowiki>.

Use ##alien --to-deb filename.rpm## to generate your ##.deb## files for Debian distributions.

Or use ##alien -i filename.rpm## to do the conversion *and* installation in one go and clean up the generated .deb file.

==== The Outloud Speech Server ====

Required: ##tclx##, so on Debian, ##apt-get install tclx8.3 tclx8.3-dev## first.

The outloud speech server for Emacspeak (thats the component which makes <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS useable to Emacspeak)
is in ##/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/linux-outloud##.
There is a ##NOTES## file in this directory which describes the compilation process.
Change the ##-ltcl## option in the Makefile to something like ##-ltcl8.3##.

You may have to add an include path so that ##tcl.h## gets found, or edit the ##tcleci.cpp## file to make the <code>#include <tcl.h></code> line fit to your systems needs. e.g. on my system, I put ##tcl8.3/tcl.h## there.
Make and install the speech server.

You should now be able to invoke emacspeak -o (the -o is to choose the outloud speech server).
Look at the emacspeak script to see how this works; basicly setting DTK_PROGRAM=outloud in your shells environment should do the trick too.

Getting Auditory Icons working:
You may have noticed that the outloud speech server tries to use a /usr/bin/stdiosynth to generate auditory icons.
This will work on some systems which have /dev/synth0. My sblive doesn't have that, and so stdiosynth doesn't work.
But my sblive is multichannel capable. So I can use /dev/dsp concurrently. Here is my .emacs setup to make this work.
Be careful, it may be necessary that you use the CVS version of Emacspeak for this to work right.

 (when (featurep 'emacspeak)
   (require 'emacspeak-aumix)
   (setq emacspeak-auditory-icon-function 'emascpeak-play-auditory-icon)
   (setq emacspeak-aumix-multichannel-capable-p t)
   (emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons 1))


== Emacspeak on Windows ==

There are several packages that aim to port Emacspeak to Windows.

* [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacspeakwin emacspeakwin]] -- At Sourceforge
* [[https://github.com/serezlan/emacspeak4windows emacspeak4windows]] -- At Github

(Documentation here needed)

== For Seeing Users ==

Emacspeak is not limited to the blind. it
could be useful for all users, too. You can 
install Emacspeak and get a gratis binary only version of *viavoice*
from IBM to use it as a software speech synthesizer on your i386 linux
box. At least a *200mhz pentium* or above is recommended.
