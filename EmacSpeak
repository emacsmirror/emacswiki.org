[[es:EmacsHabla(Emacspeak)]]
!EmacSpeak is a *text-to-speech* environment for Emacs. It uses modern techniques
to read the contents of the buffer using a *speech synthesizer*. It is helpful
for visually-impaired users.

!EmacSpeak has special features for many common modes (see the [[https://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/applications.html Applications List]])

[[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ Homepage]]

== Installation ==

An alternative guide is available in [[http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/manual/Quick-Installation.html the manual]].

Requirements:

* A computer running *Linux* (no Windows support)
* The *Emacspeak* package
* A *Voice Synthesizer* ([[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ Espeak]] or [[https://voxin.oralux.net/prices.php Voxin]])

=== Installing Espeak ===

If ##espeak## isn't available from your *package manager*, download it from [[https://espeak.sourceforge.net/ the espeak website]].

In your Emacspeak directory, you'll need to *build the espeak server*

{{{
cd servers/native-espeak
make
}}}

Test espeak by making it say something:

{{{
espeak meow
}}}

=== Installing Emacspeak ===

* Your /package manager/ may have an ##emacspeak## package.
* You can get the source code from [[https://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ the website]]

To *build from source*, enter the downloaded directory and write

{{{
make config && make
}}}

=== Connecting Emacs to Emacspeak ===

Once you installed Emacspeak, point emacs to *load the setup file*:
* If you installed Emacspeak by *source*, this is ##emacspeak/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el##
* If you got Emacspeak from a *package manager*, it may be in ##/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el##


=== Emacspeak on Windows ===

There are several packages that aim to port Emacspeak to Windows. Notes included are for ##Emacs 29## on ##Windows 11##

* [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacspeakwin emacspeakwin]] -- Throws the error ##Emacs does not seem to be working##
* [[https://github.com/serezlan/emacspeak4windows emacspeak4windows]] -- Throws the error ##No such file emacspeak-loaddefs.el##

== For Seeing Users ==

Emacspeak is not limited to the blind. it
could be useful for all users, too. You can 
install Emacspeak and get a gratis binary only version of *viavoice*
from IBM to use it as a software speech synthesizer on your i386 linux
box. At least a *200mhz pentium* or above is recommended.
