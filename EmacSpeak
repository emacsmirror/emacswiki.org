[[es:EmacsHabla(Emacspeak)]]
EmacSpeak is a complete audio desktop environment for Emacs.

What does this mean? Basically, Emacspeak implements many modern techniques
to read the content of Emacs buffer via a speech synthesizer to
a blind or visually impaired user.

The very nice Emacs philosophy of only working with text comes
very handy here- Emacspeak can (and does) implement special voice enabling features
for nearly every widespread major and minor mode. Look at the
homepage for more information (especially the application list).

The homepage of Emacspeak can be found at
https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak and http://emacspeak.sf.net
for Spanish-speaking users, this package has support at http://gnu.manticore.es

But this one is not limited to the blind. At least I think it
could be useful for ordinary hardcore emacs users too. You can 
install Emacspeak and get a gratis binary only version of viavoice
from IBM to use it as a software speech synthesizer on your i386 linux
box. At least a 200mhz pentium or above is recommended.

== Installation Instructions ==

Getting Emacspeak:
Either from emacspeak.sf.net, the CVS, or on debian systems with
 apt-get install emacspeak

Getting / Installing <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki>:
You need the IBM <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS Runtime-kit.
You previously could get it [http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/ttssdk_linux.html here], but that link is broken. Try searching for "Download the <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS SDK and TTS Run Time Kit for Linux" from there. Note, you'll have to register, but the software itself is gratis as long as you use it non-commercially. Anyway, be sure to read the license.
You'll need the file viavoice_tts_rtk.tar, getting the sdk.tar file isn't necessary, but could be fun for you. So maybe get both.
Those tar-files contain .rpm files, which you can install on RH and maybe <nowiki>SuSE</nowiki>.
13 Dec 2002  The IBM website does not appear to be offering Linux any more....
Use
 alien --to-deb filename.rpm
to generate your .deb files for Debian distributions.
Now install those files.
Or you can use 
 alien -i filename.rpm 
to do the conversion and installation in one go and clean up the generated .deb file.

Setting up the speech server:
Required: tclx, so on debian, maybe apt-get install tclx8.3 tclx8.3-dev first.
The outloud speech server for Emacspeak (thats the component which makes <nowiki>ViaVoice</nowiki> TTS useable to Emacspeak)
is in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/linux-outloud
There is a NOTES file in this directory which describes the compilation process.
Basicly, you will have to change the -ltcl option in the Makefile to something like -ltcl8.3.
And you may have to add a include path so that tcl.h gets found, or edit the tcleci.cpp file to make the #include <tcl.h> line fit to your systems needs. e.g. on my system, I put tcl8.3/tcl.h there.
Make and install the speech server.

You should now be able to invoke emacspeak -o (the -o is to choose the outloud speech server).
Look at the emacspeak script to see how this works; basicly setting DTK_PROGRAM=outloud in your shells environment should do the trick too.

Getting Auditory Icons working:
You may have noticed that the outloud speech server tries to use a /usr/bin/stdiosynth to generate auditory icons.
This will work on some systems which have /dev/synth0. My sblive doesn't have that, and so stdiosynth doesn't work.
But my sblive is multichannel capable. So I can use /dev/dsp concurrently. Here is my .emacs setup to make this work.
Be careful, it may be necessary that you use the CVS version of Emacspeak for this to work right.

 (when (featurep 'emacspeak)
   (require 'emacspeak-aumix)
   (setq emacspeak-auditory-icon-function 'emascpeak-play-auditory-icon)
   (setq emacspeak-aumix-multichannel-capable-p t)
   (emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons 1))


Hope this helps, please add questions to this wiki if you didn't understand something or something didn't work. I wrote this much out of memory, so there may be errors, as usual.


Have fun

Question: Is anything like this available for Windows? -- ZwaX

Answer: Yes, in 2013 Emacspeak port for Windows was released. See the project [https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacspeakwin emascpeakwin at sourceforge].

Question: ?

Answer:
With a little help from #emacs on irc.openprojects.net, I found out that you should export the varibale DTK_TCL like this; 
export DTK_TCL=/usr/bin/eflite
Assuming that you're running the bash shell, and that your eflite is located in /usr/bin/ -- lurwas

Question: Can this be used with festival (http://festvox.org/festival)? --DavidMcCabe

Answer: I have successfully managed to emacspeak up and running Ubuntu gutsy gibbon by using the eflite package.  Install eflite flite emacspeak.  To configure the speech server to be used, use sudo emacspeakconfig and pick eflite.  Then run emacspeak via the alsa-oss package "oss emacspeak".  You may have to install the alsa-oss package.

Answer:
This is what I get on my Debian:

 /home/alex# dpkg-reconfigure emacspeak      
 Please enter the number of your choice:                                          
   1  DECtalk Express
   2  DECtalk Multivoice
   3  DECtalk 3
   4  Software DECtalk
   5  eflite
   6  ViaVoice Outloud
   o  other.  I can provide the filename
   a  abort, and restart configuration after
      installation of another speech server package
 Number [5]: 

Run "emacspeak" to open emacs with voice. In case of problems:
* check that your user is on the group "audio"
* check that you have rights to read and write /tmp/es.socket
* check that it can open /dev/dsp; if you don't have it, use the OSS emulation from ALSA, for instance with "aoss emacspeak"

Other problems:
* strange noises at the end of each letter
* after saying the current sentence, it can be heard a bit of other past sentences
How to solve them?
