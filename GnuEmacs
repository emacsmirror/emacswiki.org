GNU Emacs (or simply Emacs) is
the [[extensible]], customizable, SelfDocumenting real-time display
editor.

GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix," and it represents the work of many contributors, initially sponsored and still stewarded by the
FreeSoftwareFoundation (FSF), and started by its founder, RichardStallman.
Part of the project to create a Unix that was FreeSoftware included
a highly functional editor as well as some sort of Lisp system.

See EmacsHistory for its history.
