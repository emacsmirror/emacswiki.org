GNU Emacs (or simply Emacs) is
the [[extensible]], customizable, SelfDocumenting real-time display
editor.

GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix," and it represents the work of the
FreeSoftwareFoundation (FSF) and its founder RichardStallman.
Part of the project to create a Unix that was FreeSoftware included
a highly functional editor as well as some sort of Lisp system.

See EmacsHistory for its history.
