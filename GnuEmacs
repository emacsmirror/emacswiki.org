GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix," and it represents the work of the
FreeSoftwareFoundation (FSF) and its founder RichardStallman.  Part of
the project to create a Unix that was FreeSoftware included a highly
functional editor as well as some sort of Lisp system.  While I don't
think that RMS had planned for Emacs to become the Lisp support for
the GNU system, in fact it has pretty much been the only Lisp to be
found in the implementation of the operating system known as GNU/Linux.

See EmacsHistory for its history.

The latest release of GNU Emacs is 24.1.  The GNU Emacs software is
subject to version 3 of the GnuGeneralPublicLicense.
