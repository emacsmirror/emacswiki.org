This package is one possible SessionManagement implementation.

When you start Emacs, package Session restores various variables (e.g., input histories) from your last session. It also provides a menu containing recently changed/visited files and restores the places (e.g., point) of such a file when you revisit it.

* http://emacs-session.sourceforge.net/ (this introduction copied from the homepage)

To restore the variables, this package writes a session file (~/.session) when you exit Emacs. The file includes the values of variables which are automatically updated by Emacs during some editing operations:

* Histories of user input. For example, strings used in a find/replace command, names of files you have visited, etc.
* Contents of registers, whether they are texts or buffer/file positions. Buffer positions are automatically converted to file positions.
* List of recently copied/cut text blocks to paste, global markers to jump to, and other so-called rings.
* List of recently changed files with their places and some buffer-local variables. 

To restore the places of a recently changed/visited file when you revisit it, this packages stores the places of a buffer in a special variable (the list mentioned above) when you kill that buffer (this includes exiting Emacs). Places are:

* [[Point]] (the TextCursor position) and [[Mark]] (e.g., the opposite position when a [[Region]] is active). These places will be restored, but a region won't be made active.
* The position of the last change. A new command (bound to C-x C-/) can be used to jump to that position.
* The boundaries if only a part of a buffer was visible. Reopening the file will again restrict/narrow the editing operations to that region.
* Values of buffer-local variables. Useful for variables which control some temporary editing behavior, e.g., overwrite-mode. 

As opposed to DeskTop and other packages, Session does not automatically revisits all files from your last session, most of which are not interesting anymore.

== Installation ==

# Get the tarball from the link given above
# extract session.el and put it in a directory on your LoadPath
# Add the following to your InitFile:

    (require 'session)
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'session-initialize)

== Discussion ==

I agree with the comment given above: Most of the files you visited last time are not interesting anymore.  Having their names in the find-file history is good enough for me.  Desktop was just too complex for my needs.

Sometimes, I use OrgMode. But org-mark-ring is a circular object. Use the following:

{{{
(when (require 'session nil t)
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'session-initialize)
  (add-to-list 'session-globals-exclude 'org-mark-ring))
}}}

There is a function in session that's not really persistence related -- `session-jump-to-last-change' <C-x C-/>.  This is the singular most useful function of any Emacs add-on to me.  It moves the point to the last modified location.  Keep calling it and you will visit all the locations you've made modifications.  Absolutely brilliant.  Unobstrusive, unlike highlight-changes-mode.

However, it doesn't automatically reveal folded sections.  Here is the fix:

{{{
;;; expanded folded secitons as required
(defun le::maybe-reveal ()
  (when (and (or (memq major-mode  '(org-mode outline-mode))
                 (and (boundp 'outline-minor-mode)
                      outline-minor-mode))
             (outline-invisible-p))
    (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
        (org-reveal)
      (show-subtree))))

(add-hook 'session-after-jump-to-last-change-hook
          'le::maybe-reveal)
}}}

Can this mode replace savehist, saveplace and desktop all at once and advantageneously ? Sounds like it is really capable and as I do not like restoring all the files and things like that, that could help just activating one mode for all this stuff

I've been using session for many years. I also use it to restore my project specific settings in a per-project basis. Here is how it works:
Add the following code segment into your .emacs init script. It will search ".emacs.session" file in the directory where you start Emacs.

{{{
;;; Local session.
(unless (daemonp)
  (custom-set-variables '(session-save-file ".emacs.session"))

  (let ((local-session (concat default-directory session-save-file)))
    (if (file-exists-p local-session)
        (progn
          (custom-set-variables '(session-save-file local-session))
          (message (concat "Local session file set to \"" session-save-file "\".")))
      (custom-set-variables '(session-save-file (concat "~/" session-save-file))))))
}}}

Session does not work well with emacs daemon mode.

When one exits/restarts emacs server, the session position is not saved.

This is because kill-emacs-hook is not run in this case.

Here is my solution for session.el. It worked fine for emacs 24.3.

{{{
(require 'session)
(session-jump-to-last-change)
(session-initialize)
;; session will save if any frame is deleted.
(add-hook 'delete-frame-functions
         (lambda (frame)
           (session-save-session t)
           ))

}}}


Just be careful to exit existing emacs frame before restarting the emacs daemon.

I've made little modification of Billy.Zheng (zw963) script, instead using delete-frame-functions I use after-save-hook, so the session is save every time buffer is save to file without waiting to exit the frame of emacs.

{{{
(require 'session)
(session-jump-to-last-change)
(session-initialize)
;; session will be save if a buffer is save to a file.
(add-hook 'after-save-hook #'session-save-session)
}}}
