This page is about Omit Mode in [[Dired]], which lets you hide uninteresting files, such as backup files and AutoSave files.

It is defined in the built-in [[Dired X]] package, so need to load that:

    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (require 'dired-x))) ; Load Dired X when Dired is loaded.
    (setq dired-omit-mode t) ; Turn on Omit mode.

`M-o' in Dired buffers toggles hiding of files. Variables `dired-omit-files' and `dired-omit-extensions' together define the uninteresting files. (Versions of Emacs before 22.1 used `dired-omit-files-p').

With most recent Emacs versions no hooks are needed and the following lines in your [[init file]] enable omit mode (in this example dot files are omitted):

    (require 'dired-x)
    (setq-default dired-omit-files-p t) ; Buffer-local variable
    (setq dired-omit-files (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^\\..+$"))




=== Coloring Dot Files?  ===

One thing that I want is for dot-files (e.g., ##.bashrc##, ##.emacs##, etc.) to be colored in the same dim face that the other uninteresting files are colored in.  I use ##(setq dired-omit-files "^\\.?#\\|^\\.$\\|^\\.\\.$\\|^\\..*$")##, which hides my dot files when I hit `M-o', but these files aren't colored in the dim face.

That dims only the files that match the extensions in `dired-omit-extensions', but obviously this won't work for dot files.  '''Does anyone have a work-around for this?''' Thanks. -- [[parolang]]

'''See [[Dired+]]''' for a way to color less-interesting files differently in Dired. Combined with Omit mode, this can do either of the following:
* Give you two levels of disinterest.
* Let you ''see'' uninteresting files, but not have them stand out.


=== No Omit Mode for `recover-session'  ===

Dired ignores ##*~## files, which are used by `recover-session'. The following turns on omit mode except when running `recover-session':

   (defun enable-dired-omit-mode () (dired-omit-mode 1))
   (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'enable-dired-omit-mode)
   
   (defadvice recover-session (around disable-dired-omit-for-recover activate)
     (let ((dired-mode-hook dired-mode-hook))
       (remove-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'enable-dired-omit-mode)
       ad-do-it))




===  Toggle Showing Dot Files  ===

  (defun dired-dotfiles-toggle ()
    "Show/hide dot-files"
    (interactive)
    (when (equal major-mode 'dired-mode)
      (if (or (not (boundp 'dired-dotfiles-show-p)) dired-dotfiles-show-p) ; if currently showing
	  (progn 
	    (set (make-local-variable 'dired-dotfiles-show-p) nil)
	    (message "h")
	    (dired-mark-files-regexp "^\\\.")
	    (dired-do-kill-lines))
	(progn (revert-buffer) ; otherwise just revert to re-show
	       (set (make-local-variable 'dired-dotfiles-show-p) t)))))

=== Remember Omit State ===

I prefer that Dired remember my omit state: when enabling/disabling `omit-mode', the `omit-mode' remains enabled/disabled in another Dired buffer.  This code does that:

   (defvar v-dired-omit t
     "If dired-omit-mode enabled by default. Don't setq me.")
   (defun dired-omit-switch ()
     "This function is a small enhancement for `dired-omit-mode', which will
   \"remember\" omit state across Dired buffers."
     (interactive)
     (if (eq v-dired-omit t)
         (setq v-dired-omit nil)
       (setq v-dired-omit t))
     (dired-omit-caller)
     (revert-buffer))
   
   (defun dired-omit-caller ()
     (if v-dired-omit
         (setq dired-omit-mode t)
       (setq dired-omit-mode nil)))
   
   (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-x M-o") 'dired-omit-switch)
   (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-omit-caller)

===  Using `ls' Switches Instead of Omit Mode  ===

An alternative to using Omit mode: Use `C-u s' to change the `ls' switches and immediately refresh. (`C-u s' refreshes also, so there is very little typing involved.)  Usually you will want to remove ##-a## from the switches, to hide dot files. 

With this approach you can do everything you can do in the shell console, which is far more than what a simple Omit mode toggle can offer (at the cost of some extra keypresses). And there is a history of previous flags available, so toggling is pretty fast with this approach also. -- [[190-216-58-35.static.impsat.net.ar]]
