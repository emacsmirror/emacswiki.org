i'm eepy rn but here's stuff that i'll add about ibuffer filtering in the future:

* ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
* switching between groups
* toggling filters
* hiding buffers
* hiding groups
* sub-groups (maybe non-trivial)
* what the HECK does ##ibuffer-filter-format-alist## do???
* helpful filtering key bindings
* moving Default to the top (or generally moving groups)
* collapse / expand all / current
