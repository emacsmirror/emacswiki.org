Banning "online" sure would help. :)

I would like to edit a link to quotenil.com/OfflineIMAP-with-Encrypted-Authinfo.html, but it is banned.

OK, first of all, I cannot even be specific about the problem, because it is blocked and I lost my first submission and had to write this all again (lol).

OK so the problem seems to be that the regex 'deba n OR l ink' is catching https://github.com/toshism/org-super-<banned-word>.

Banning the word 'l ink' seems a bit broad to me, no?

Hopefully this goes through.

In re-writing, I forgot to mention that it was the OrgMode page I was trying to edit in the first place.

Update: I was able to get wasamasa (in IRC) to comment out the overly broad regexp.  Then I was able to post my edit.  Thanks!
