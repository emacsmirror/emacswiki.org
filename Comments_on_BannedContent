First off I want to say wonderful blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to ask 
if you don't mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear 
your mind before writing. I have had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my ideas out there.
I truly do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the first 
10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any 
recommendations or hints? Kudos!
