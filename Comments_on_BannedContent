After a while when I had to finally deal with my car. For months it was not performing properly — unstable engine performance. 
I visited several STOs, replaced different elements, spent money, but nobody could clearly explain why previous fixes didn’t work. 
At some point I started looking for real diagnostic logic, not just assumptions. 
That’s how I found practical automotive articles here: 
https://stocar.kh.ua 
This site explains real reasons behind performance loss in a structured, understandable way — without marketing noise. 
Thanks to these materials, I finally understood what previous services missed and was able to fix the problem correctly. 
Very useful resource if you want to understand your car better.
