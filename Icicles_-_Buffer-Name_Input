== Buffer-Name Input ==

The '''Icicles''' [[command]]s that read [[buffer]] names are [[multi-command]]s, so you can act on more than one
buffer during a given command invocation.

These commands all let you use a [[prefix argument]] to control which
buffers are completion candidates.  It is the numeric value of the
prefix arg that matters  Candidates are only the buffers that
satisfy these conditions:

* '''Plain `C-u'''': whose ''[[major mode|mode]]'' is ''derived'' from the current buffer mode
* '''`C-u C-u'''' ('''double'''): ''visible'' (possibly in an iconified frame)
* '''`C-u C-u C-u'''' ('''triple'''): ''invisible''
* '''Zero:''' whose ''mode'' is the ''same'' as the current buffer mode
* '''Positive:''' visiting ''files''
* '''Negative:''' associated with the selected ''[[frame]]''

Those are the default behaviors, but you can change them using
[[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-prefix-arg-filtering|icicle-buffer-prefix-arg-filtering]]</tt>'''' 


`icicle-buffer' (`C-x b' in ''Icicle'' mode, by default) is a [[multi-command]] that accepts [[multi-completion]] input: the first part
matches buffer names, and the second part, which is optional,
matches buffer content.  So for example:


: '''##C-x b##'''## f o o##   -> Match buffer names against `foo'

: '''##C-x b  C-M-j##'''## t o t o## -> Match buffer contents against `toto'

: '''##C-x b##'''## f o o ##'''##C-M-j##'''## t o t o## -> Match both buffer name and contents

You can use [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-skip-functions|icicle-buffer-skip-functions]]</tt>'''' to specify patterns
for buffer names to exclude from content-searching when you
provide a content-matching pattern to `icicle-buffer'.


In addition to the usual '''Icicles''' key bindings, during buffer-name
completion you can use additional keys, which are defined by
option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings|icicle-buffer-candidate-key-bindings]]</tt>''''.  These are the keys
provided by the default value of the option:

[:icicle-toggle-include-cached-files]
[:icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag]
* '''`C-x F'''' ('''`icicle-toggle-include-cached-files'''') Toggle whether
`icicle-buffer' includes cached file names as candidates.  That
is, toggle [[option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag|icicle-buffer-include-cached-files-nflag]]</tt>''''.  A [[prefix argument]] sets the option value to the numeric prefix value.
 
[:icicle-toggle-include-recent-files]
[:icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag]
* '''`C-x R'''' ('''`icicle-toggle-include-recent-files'''') Toggle whether
`icicle-buffer' includes the names of recently accessed files as candidates.  That
is, toggle option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag|icicle-buffer-include-recent-files-nflag]]</tt>''''.  A prefix arg sets the option value to the numeric prefix value.

[:icicle-bookmark-non-file-other-window]
* '''`C-x m'''' ('''`icicle-bookmark-non-file-other-window'''') to visit a
  [[BookmarkPlus#AdditionalTypes|bookmarked buffer]].  This is available only if you use library
  '''[[Bookmark+]]'''.  This too is a [[multi-command]], so you can actually
  visit any number of buffer bookmarks with one use of `C-x m'.  When finished, you can
  continue with non-bookmark buffer-name completion.


[:icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode]
* '''`C-x C-m -'''' ('''`icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode'''') to ''remove'' the
  buffer-name candidates with a major
  mode that is ''derived from'' a given ''mode''.  You are prompted for the mode.  You can repeat this key to narrow buffer candidates by mode.  (`C-m' is the same key as `RET'.)

[:icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode]
* '''`##C-x C-m +##'''' ('''`icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-derived-mode'''') to ''keep only'' the
  buffer-name candidates with a major
  mode that is ''derived from'' a given ''mode''.  You are prompted for the mode.   (`C-m' is the same key as `RET'.)


[:icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-mode]
* '''`C-x M -'''' ('''`icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-mode'''') -- same as `C-x C-m -', but excludes ancestor modes.

[:icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-mode]
* '''`##C-x M +##'''' ('''`icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-mode'''') -- same as `##C-x C-m +##', but excludes ancestor modes.

[:icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-visible]
* '''`C-x v -'''' ('''`icicle-remove-buffer-cands-for-visible'''') to ''remove''
the candidate buffers that are ''visible''.  This includes buffers
that are in iconified frames.

[:icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-visible]
* '''`##C-x v +##'''' ('''`icicle-keep-only-buffer-cands-for-visible'''') to ''keep
only'' the candidate buffers that are ''visible''.  This includes
buffers that are in iconified frames.




* '''`S-delete'''' to ''kill'' the buffer named by the current completion
  candidate.

When cached or recently used file names are included as candidates, option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-file-skip-functions|icicle-file-skip-functions]]</tt>'''' is used to exclude
files from content-searching whose names match its patterns,
similarly to what `icicle-buffer-skip-functions' does for buffer names.


During completion, candidate sorting is specific to buffer names.
`##C-,##' cycles among the following ''sort orders'':

* by ''last access''
* `##*## ... ##*##' last: put buffers such as `*Messages*' and `*Help*' last
* by buffer ''size''
* by ''major mode'' name
* by mode-line mode name (''mode name'' that appears in the [[mode line]])
* by (absolute) ''file'' or ''process'' name

Remember too that the [[mode line|mode-line]] candidate help for a buffer-name
candidate includes the mode name, buffer size, and associated
file or directory, if any.  The directory name can be especially helpful for [[Dired]]
buffer candidates, since the buffer name does not tell you the
full directory.  For example, if you do `C-u C-x b' from Dired, so
the candidates are names of Dired buffers only, then cycling shows you
the directory for each one.

Similarly, the more detailed help available from `C-M-RET'
etc. also lists the full name of the file or directory associated
with the buffer.


The following [[user option]]s control buffer-name completion.
