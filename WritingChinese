== Input ==

Emacs has built-in support for many chinese input methods, packaged in leim. You can switch input method with C-\

Also Emacs supports the XIM protocol for X Windows applications and IME input method for MS Windows apps, such as wineinput or minichinput for Linux, and pyjj or MS pinyin for MS windows. Beware that you need to set the charset coding of your input method in the <tt>.emacs</tt> file to use windows IME input method, for example:
<pre>
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)
</pre>

See also the <em>Specify Coding</em> node in EmacsManual.

If you want the double-width gb2312 equivalents of ASCII characters instead of the normal ASCII characters then this is useful:


    (global-set-key [(f2)]
		'(lambda () (interactive) 
		   (if (equal current-input-method "chinese-tonepy-punct")
		       (set-input-method 'chinese-qj)
		     (set-input-method 'chinese-tonepy-punct)
		     )
		   )
		)

Change <code>chinese-tonepy-punct</code> to your favourite Chinese input method.

An input method which does this automatically would be better, but this is beyond my expertise to write.

== Setup Example ==

This is my Chinese section in my .emacs file:

<pre>
; -*- Chinese-*-

(set-keyboard-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)   ; input

(set-selection-coding-system 'chinese-iso-8bit)  ; copy/paste

(setq w32-enable-synthesized-fonts t)

(if (not (member '("-*-courier new-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese"
   . "fontset-chinese") fontset-alias-alist))

    (progn
        (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec	; chinese fontset
        "-*-Courier New-normal-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese,
         chinese-gb2312:-*-MS Song-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-gb2312*-*,
         chinese-big5-1:-*-MingLiU-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*,
         chinese-big5-2:-*-MingLiU-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*" t)
         
         (setq default-frame-alist
            (append
             '((font . "fontset-chinese"))
             default-frame-alist))
    )
)

; end

</pre>

== Other Chinese Input Method ==

=== pyim ===

[https://github.com/tumashu/pyim pyim] is a emacs Chinese input method,
supports full pinyin, double pinyin, wubi, canggu, and Rime. Check
[http://tumashu.github.io/pyim pyim online document].

pyim was forked from Eim and is maintained.

pyim is in [[MELPA]]. You can easily install it. It is a self contained input
method in pure elisp. I tried the pinyin engine, it works fine in emacs GUI
and terminal out of the box.

Project goal is try best to be the most easy to use Emacs Chinese input
method, specifically

# Fallback: When external input method can't be used, e.g. in console or cygwin environment, let user not worry about Chinese input.
# Integration: reduce the need to toggle input method. Input Chinese should not interfere with good Emacs experience.
# Exchange: make using other good input method's phrase db easy.

To use pyim

# [http://melpa.org/#/getting-started config MELPA package archive]
# M-x package-install RET pyim RET
# add in ~/.emacs

<pre>
(require 'pyim)
(require 'pyim-basedict) ; 拼音词库设置，五笔用户 *不需要* 此行设置
(pyim-basedict-enable)   ; 拼音词库，五笔用户 *不需要* 此行设置
(setq pyim-dcache-backend 'pyim-dregcache) ; 对低配置电脑使用更节省内存启动更快的引擎， *只对*拼音用户有效 
(setq default-input-method "pyim")
</pre>

=== zero-el ===

zero-el is a new Chinese input method framework for emacs. A pinyin input
method is included in zero-el. zero-el is tested to work on emacs 24+, debian
9 stretch, debian 10 buster, ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Unlike pyim, which is portable, zero-el pinyin engine has external dependence
on zero-pinyin-service and zero-panel. As author of zero-el, I would recommend
user choose pyim instead.

* [https://blog.emacsos.com/zero-el.html introducing zero-el]
* [https://gitlab.emacsos.com/sylecn/zero-el zero-el source code]

I didn't know about pyim when I started zero-el project. Otherwise, I probably
won't bother write a new input method. --sylecn

=== Eim ===

Recently, I wrote a package [[Eim]] to input chinese character. I think this is better
than quail for a chinese input method. I provide two input method
associate this package, the wubi and pinyin. The pinyin input method need a word file which 
can be found in my pages[http://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn:8080/2005211356/src/eim.zip]. More detail
describe can see EimForChinese

I test in emacs22 and cvs emacs.

=== WuBi ===

There is a nice wubi package that I use.  Some information and tips are at WritingChineseWithWuBi.

Does anyone have the configuration w/o using M$ fonts, but AR PL fonts?
