This page describes libraries Lisp:dired-details.el and Lisp:dired-details+.el, which let you hide or show the file and directory details in a Dired listing, to save space and clutter. When details are hidden, all you see (and all IncrementalSearch sees) are the file names.

== dired-details.el ==

RobGiardina has written library <tt>[[dired-details.el]]</tt>, which lets you hide and show the details of each file or directory in DiredMode. You use 
`'''<tt>(</tt>'''' to show details and `'''<tt>)</tt>'''' to hide them. 

Hiding details reduces a verbose directory listing such as this:

       -rw-r--r--   1 rgiardin svrtech     4141 Aug 23 17:07 dired-details.el
       -rw-r--r--   1 rgiardin svrtech       56 Aug 23 17:07 linked-file.el -> /var/tmp/checkouts/linked-file.el

to just this:

       [...] dired-details.el
       [...] linked-file.el -> [...]

or to just this, if you set `dired-details-hidden-string' to ##""## instead of ##"[...]"##:

       dired-details.el
       linked-file.el ->

[:Screenshots]
== Screenshots ==

Here are two screenshots, one showing details, one hiding them:

The difference in [[Frame]] size is due to the automatic frame resizing provided by <tt>[[dired-details+.el]]</tt> (see [[#DiredDetailsPlus]]).

[:DiredDetailsPlus]
== Dired Details Plus ==

Library <tt>[[dired-details+.el]]</tt> provides some minor but convenient enhancements to <tt>[[dired-details.el]]</tt>. It loads <tt>dired-details.el</tt> and activates show/hide, so <tt>dired-details+.el</tt> is all you ever need to load.

##dired-details+.el## provides the following enhancements:

* It binds `dired-details-toggle' to both `##)##' and `##(##', so you don't need to remember which shows and which hides.

* It lets you optionally propagate the current hide/show setting to the next DiredMode buffer (option `dired-details-propagate-flag'). If non-`nil', future Dired buffers you open use the hide/show appearance that you last had.

* It makes DiredMode commands that byte-compile, compress, rename, and create files or directories also update the hide/show overlays accordingly. Without this enhancement, for instance, even with details hidden, creating a new file lists it with details showing.

* It automatically shrink-wraps a one-window Dired frame whenever you show/hide details (if you also load library Lisp:autofit-frame.el). See the screenshots above ([[#Screenshots]]).

== Dired-Details and WDired ==

When editing file names with `dired-toggle-read-only' and committing, everything works as expected, but if changes are aborted details are displayed until the listing is refreshed.

It would be good if when copying text from a dired buffer with details hidden, the details are not also copied (which is what happens at the moment), e.g. when sending somebody a message with a list of filenames. -- JoeBloggs

This applies to hidden details in Emacs 23 and later, as well to details hidden by ##dired-details.el##.

1. You can control this with user option `yank-excluded-properties'.  By default, yanking text that has property `invisible' (as is the case here) strips the text of that property, which means that the hidden text is not hidden after yanking.

You can, for example, define a yank command for use in this context that binds `yank-excluded-properties' to its current value minus any `invisible' entry and then calls `yank' or `insert-for-yank'.  Such a command could be useful for cases like this, where you want to hide invisible text after yanking.

But Emacs has no way of knowing, unless you tell it, that in general you do want to strip property `invisible' when you yank, but you do not want to strip it in some particular contexts, such as this one. 

2. But all of that concerns only yanking in Emacs, not pasting to some other application. It does not remove the text that was invisible, it just keeps it invisible.  If you want to actually remove invisible text from the copied string then you need to jump through different hoops.  You can do what you want using functions from library '''<tt>[[subr+.el]]</tt>'''. Function '''`buffer-substring-visible'''', for example, returns the buffer text between any two positions, but with invisible parts of it stripped out. You can see an example of using `buffer-substring-visible' in library <tt>[[narrow-indirect.el]]</tt> -- see function `ni-buffer-substring-collapsed-visible', where the buffer text between two limits has its invisible text removed and its whitespace collapsed. -- DrewAdams
