=== Description ===

GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents
via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly interface.
New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality
typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce
professionally looking documents. [http://www.texmacs.org/]

TeXmacs is also used as an interface for computer algebra systems.

It uses Guile/Scheme as extension language.

=== Relation with Emacs ===

One of the fundamental ideas behind TeXmacs is that we wanted
a WYSIWYG editor for structured documents with the same
customizability as Emacs. Just like the native format of
an Emacs document is basically a string, the native format
of a TeXmacs document is a tree. This is particularly powerful
in relation to Lisp-like extension languages (we chose
Guile Scheme, because this is a standard extension language
for the GNU Project and Gnome), which are particularly suited
for tree manipulations.

There are exist many plugins for !TeXmacs, among others for
Maxima computer algebra system and R software environment for 
statistical computing.

=== Website, wiki and blog ===
