'''[::Isearch]''', that is, '''[::incremental search]''', is the standard way to search in vanilla Emacs.  Type `C-s' and start typing a search string -- Emacs finds a match to what you've typed so far. Change your input, and Emacs adjusts to find the new target. This dynamic, on-the-fly behavior is what is meant by "incremental" search.

[:StdIsearchKeys]
= Standard Isearch Keys =
You can define your own keymap to extend Isearch with some other key bindings (see [[#MoreIsearchKeys]], below), but Isearch already comes with these handy keybindings (and more):

* ''Quitting'' Isearch -- Many [[KeySequence]]s quit Isearch.  One that many people use is `RET'. You ''cannot'' use `RET' to search for the end of a line -- use `C-q C-j' for that. The cursor is left on the last match.
* `C-g' -- Abort the search, putting back the cursor to its initial position.
* `C-s' -- Repeat the search as many times as you want throughout the buffer.
* `C-w' -- Select the (rest of the) ''word'' the TextCursor is on as the search string; repeating `C-w' appends more words to the search string.
* `C-y' -- Select the text up to the end of the ''line'' as the search string.
* `M-y' -- Yank (paste) the ''text last copied'' to the kill-buffer (clipboard) to the end of the search string.
* `M-n', `M-p' -- Re-use a ''previous'' search string. Repeat to choose older strings. `M-n' moves forward in the search history; `M-p' moves backward.
* `M-TAB' -- ''Complete'' the current search string against all ''previous'' search strings.
* `M-c' -- Toggle search ''case-sensitivity''.
* `M-r' -- Toggle between ''regular-expression'' searching and literal-string searching.
* `M-e' -- Pause to ''edit'' the search string. Searching is disabled until you explicitly resume it with `C-j' (or `C-s' or `C-r').
* ##‘M-%’## -- Start ''query replace'' using the current string.
* ##‘C-M-%’## -- Start a regular-expression query replace using the current search string.

''Sidenote'': to enter a literal newline in the search field, you can type
<code>C-q C-j</code>. You can also bind the literal newline to a simpler shortcut (e.g. <code>C-o</code>) by putting in your init file:

    (define-key isearch-mode-map "\C-o" 
          '(lambda ()(interactive)(isearch-process-search-char ?\n)))

== Highlighting Matches ==

There's a key binding withing `isearch-mode' to use your current search term as an argument to `highlight-regexp':

* `M-s h r' -- highlight regular expression
* `M-s h u' -- unhighlight regular expression

== Collecting Matches ==

There's a key binding withing `isearch-mode' to use your current search term as an argument to [[OccurMode|occur]]:

* `M-s o' -- call `occur' with the current search term

[:MoreIsearchKeys]
= More Isearch Keys: Adding Key Bindings =

* '''[[Icicles]]''' lets you use `S-TAB' to complete the current search string against all previous search strings. This is thus similar to `M-TAB' (see [[#StdIsearchKeys]], above), but it gives you all of the '''Icicles''' [[Completion]] features: regexp matching, candidate cycling, ... In particular, you can see all matching previous searches in buffer `*Completions*' and either click one (`mouse-2') or cycle to it with '''Page Up'''/'''Down'''.  See [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements]].

* IsearchPlus adds the following bindings (the standard bindings for some of these use the Meta modifier (`M-') instead).
** `C-h' provides '''''help''''' on Isearch while isearching. Library IsearchPlus also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists ''all'' Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly
** `C-t' lets you toggle between ''regular-expression'' isearching and normal isearching. (Standard binding `M-r'.)
** `C-c' lets you toggle ''case-sensitivity'' while isearching. (Standard binding `M-c'.)
** `C-SPC' lets you toggle setting the region around the last found occurrence. IsearchPlus adds a function to `isearch-mode-end-hook' that respects the state of this toggle.
** `C-j' lets you edit the search string. It also provides other options, like changing to ''word search'' (`C-w' as first char) or ''non-incremental search'' (RET). (Standard binding `M-e'.)

* Make `C-h' in Isearch provide help on Isearch.  See IncrementalSearchHelp. This is also done by IsearchPlus (see above).

* Make `C-y' in Isearch act like `M-y' does in the default map:

       (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-y") 'isearch-yank-kill)

:: Why? By default, `C-y' in Isearch doesn't do what you might expect: Instead of yanking from the `kill-ring' to the search string, it acts on the current line.


* `isearch-occur' -> OccurFromIsearch: Invoke `occur' on Isearch hits.

* `isearch-highlight-phrase' -> HighlightFromIsearch: Highlight Isearch hits even after searching.

* The following pulls the next expression or symbol from buffer into the search string:

       (defun isearch-yank-sexp ()
         "*Pull next expression from buffer into search string."
         (interactive)
         (isearch-yank-internal (lambda () (forward-sexp 1) (point))))

:: Bind it to some key of your preference in <code>isearch-mode-map</code>.

* When you do long searches (when you search for a keyword in a large file and get many hits) if you sometimes get tired in your left pinky (all those repeated C-s), you might want to try the following code. It rebinds `C-s' and `C-r' to the <nowiki><next></nowiki> and <nowiki><prior></nowiki> keys (page down and up):

       (define-key isearch-mode-map [next]
         'isearch-repeat-forward)

       (define-key isearch-mode-map [prior]
         'isearch-repeat-backward)




[:RegexpSearches]
= Regexp Searches (On Beyond Wildcards) =

Searching with regular expressions (regexps) is searching with ''wildcards'' (and more). If you aren't already searching using regexps, then that's the ''next thing you should learn'' -- *NOW!*

Try `C-M-s' (forward) or `C-M-r' (backward) -- or you can just do `M-r' from isearch (or `C-t' if you make the binding recommended above -- see [[#MoreIsearchKeys]]).

With regexp searching you will need to think a little more, but will do fewer searches for a task, and will be able to more precisely get what you're searching for. 

To learn about regexps, see RegularExpression. 



= Position of Point =

Note that when you type `C-r', isearch goes backwards.  When you search
backwards, find something, and then end the search, for example by
hitting `RET', point is at the beginning of the string you searched.
When you search forwards, point is not necessarily at the end of the string you
were searching for, but only after the last character that you typed
-- bad usability!  That means that you cannot predict point
based on the string you are searching for (and thinking about).  You
must predict point based on the numbers of characters you typed.

Here is how to change that in your InitFile, courtesy of AdrianKubala:

    (add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook 'my-goto-match-beginning)
    (defun my-goto-match-beginning ()
      (when isearch-forward (goto-char isearch-other-end)))

    (defadvice isearch-exit (after my-goto-match-beginning activate)
      "Go to beginning of match."
      (when isearch-forward (goto-char isearch-other-end)))

With this hook, both `C-g' and `RET' exit the search at the begining of the search string. To recover the old behaviour of `C-g' (going back to where you where before starting the search), you can change the hook to (only tested on Emacs 22):

    (defun my-goto-match-beginning ()
      (when (and isearch-forward (not isearch-mode-end-hook-quit))
        (goto-char isearch-other-end)))


'''''Tip:''''' To get back to where you started the search, just use `C-x C-x'. This works because isearch sets the mark at the search start (if point ends up elsewhere after searching).

''Note:'' Emacs 21 currently has a bug in that `isearch-mode-end-hook' is called ''after'' `C-g' exits an isearch. That means that if you end a search with `C-g' you cannot use `C-x C-x' to get back to where you were before searching.
[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-25 17:33 UTC]
Since I submitted that bug, I've heard back that it will be corrected in the next GNU Emacs release. -- DrewAdams

= Minibuffer Feedback During Isearch =

Lisp library Lisp:oneonone.el, from DrewAdams, changes the background color of the (separate) MiniBuffer [[Frame]] when you isearch. Screenshots of the minibuffer frame (normal, followed by isearch):

= Icicles Search: Another Way to Search Incrementally =

Besides enhancing Isearch completion (see [[#MoreIsearchKeys]], above), '''[[Icicles]]''' provides an additional, unusual way of searching incrementally that is akin to both isearch and `occur' -- but weirder! The explanation is here: [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]]. Highlights:

* Perform a regexp search for ''search contexts'' in a buffer, the region, multiple buffers, or multiple saved regions. You can limit the contexts to matches of a regexp subgroup, if you want. 

* (Optional) Search incrementally ''within'' the search contexts, using another, fine-tuning regexp -- that is, filter all of the original hits at once, using a second regexp.

* (Optional) Hit a key to ''replace'' the current search hit with different text at any time, or replace all search hits.

"Incremental" has a double meaning here:

* You can change your (optional) fine-tuning regexp on the fly, and see the changes among the original search hits.

* You can move incrementally among search hits in the target buffer(s).

I often search for a string which I want to grab and paste elsewhere:
So I want to find it, mark it, and kill it.
I can use C-w/C-z to extend the search string (either by word or by sexp), and then I just want to grab is somehow:  I think it's natural to bind it to M-w.

Here's how:

  (defun isearch-save-and-exit ()
     "Exit search normally. and save the `search-string' on kill-ring."
    (interactive)
    (isearch-done)
    (isearch-clean-overlays)
    (kill-new isearch-string))
 
  (define-key isearch-mode-map    "\M-w" 'isearch-save-and-exit)
