'''[::Isearch]''', that is, '''[::incremental search]''', is the standard way to search in vanilla Emacs.  Type `C-s' and start typing a search string -- Emacs finds a match to what you've typed so far. Change your input, and Emacs adjusts to find the new target. This dynamic, on-the-fly behavior is what is meant by "incremental" search.


[:RegexpSearches]
== Regexp Searches (On Beyond Wildcards) ==

Searching with regular expressions ([[regexp]]s) is searching with ''wildcards'' (and more). If you aren't already searching using regexps, then that's the ''next thing you should learn'' -- *NOW!*

Try `C-M-s' (forward) or `C-M-r' (backward) -- or you can use `M-r' after `C-s' or `C-r' (i.e., during a literal search).

With regexp searching you will need to think a little more, but will do fewer searches for a task, and will be able to more precisely get what you're searching for. 

To learn about regexps, see RegularExpression. 





[:StdIsearchKeys]
== Standard Isearch Keys ==
You can define your own keymap to extend Isearch with some other key bindings (see [[#MoreIsearchKeys]], below), but Isearch already comes with these handy keybindings (and more):

* ''Quitting'' Isearch -- Many [[KeySequence]]s quit Isearch.  One that many people use is `RET'. You ''cannot'' use `RET' to search for the end of a line -- use `C-q C-j' for that. The cursor is left on the last match.
* `C-g' -- Abort the search, putting back the cursor to its initial position.
* `C-s' -- Repeat the search as many times as you want throughout the buffer.
* `C-w' -- Select the (rest of the) ''word'' the TextCursor is on as the search string; repeating `C-w' appends more words to the search string.
* `M-s C-e' -- Select the text up to the end of the ''line'' as the search string (this was bound to `C-y' up until Emacs 24.1).
* `M-s h r' -- Highlight regular expression (`highlight-regexp')
* `M-s h u' -- Unhighlight regular expression
* `M-s o' -- call `occur' with the current search term
* `C-y' -- Yank (paste) the ''text last copied'' to the kill-buffer (clipboard) to the end of the search string (this was bound to `M-y' up until Emacs 24.1).
* `M-n', `M-p' -- Re-use a ''previous'' search string. Repeat to choose older strings. `M-n' moves forward in the search history; `M-p' moves backward.
* `M-TAB' -- ''Complete'' the current search string against all ''previous'' search strings.
* `M-c' -- Toggle search ''case-sensitivity''.
* `M-r' -- Toggle between ''regular-expression'' searching and literal-string searching.
* `M-e' -- Pause to ''edit'' the search string. Searching is disabled until you explicitly resume it with `C-j' (or `C-s' or `C-r').
* ##‘M-%’## -- Start ''query replace'' using the current string.
* ##‘C-M-%’## -- Start a regular-expression query replace using the current search string.









[:MoreIsearchKeys]
== More Isearch Keys: Adding Key Bindings ==

* '''[[Icicles]]''' lets you use `S-TAB' to complete the current search string against all previous search strings. This is thus similar to `M-TAB' (see [[#StdIsearchKeys]], above), but it gives you all of the '''Icicles''' [[completion]] features: regexp matching, candidate cycling, ... In particular, you can see all matching previous searches in buffer `*Completions*' and either click one (`mouse-2') or cycle to it with '''Page Up'''/'''Down'''.  See [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements]].

* [[Isearch+]] adds the following bindings.
** '''`C-h'''' provides help on Isearch while isearching.  It also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists ''all'' Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly
** '''`##C-+##’''' toggles searching through invisible text.
** '''`M-w'''' toggles whole-word search.
** '''`C-SPC'''' toggles setting the [[region]] around the last found occurrence.  It adds a function to `isearch-mode-end-hook' that respects the state of this toggle.
** '''`##C-`##'''' toggles quoting (escaping) of [[regexp]] special characters.
** '''`C-c'''' toggles case-sensitivity while isearching. (Standard binding `M-c'.)
** '''`##C-_##'''' yanks successive [[symbol]]s into the search string.
** '''`##C-(##'''' yanks successive [[sexp]]s into the search string.
** '''`C-j'''' lets you edit the search string. It also provides other options, like changing to ''word search'' (`C-w' as first char) or ''non-incremental search'' (RET). (Standard binding `M-e'.)

* Make `C-h' in Isearch provide help on Isearch.  See IncrementalSearchHelp. This is also done by [[Isearch+]] (see above).

* For Emacs 23 and earlier, make `C-y' in Isearch act like `M-y' does in the default map:

       (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-y") 'isearch-yank-kill)

:: Why? Up until Emacs 24.1, `C-y' in Isearch didn't do what you might expect: Instead of yanking from the `kill-ring' to the search string, it acts on the current line.

* `isearch-occur' -> OccurFromIsearch: Invoke `occur' on Isearch hits.

* `isearch-highlight-phrase' -> HighlightFromIsearch: Highlight Isearch hits even after searching.

* The following pulls the next expression or symbol from buffer into the search string:

       (defun isearch-yank-sexp ()
         "*Pull next expression from buffer into search string."
         (interactive)
         (isearch-yank-internal (lambda () (forward-sexp 1) (point))))

:: Bind it to some key of your preference in <code>isearch-mode-map</code>.

* When you do long searches (when you search for a keyword in a large file and get many hits) if you sometimes get tired in your left pinky (all those repeated C-s), you might want to try the following code. It rebinds `C-s' and `C-r' to the <nowiki><next></nowiki> and <nowiki><prior></nowiki> keys (page down and up):

       (define-key isearch-mode-map [next]
         'isearch-repeat-forward)

       (define-key isearch-mode-map [prior]
         'isearch-repeat-backward)

* Insert a newline char in the search field: `C-q C-j'.  To use another key for this, e.g. `C-o', do this in your init file:

    (define-key isearch-mode-map "\C-o" 
          '(lambda ()(interactive)(isearch-process-search-char ?\n)))


[:PointAfterSearching]
== Position of the Cursor after Searching ==

Note that when you type `C-r', isearch goes backwards.  When you search
backwards, find something, and then end the search, for example by
hitting `RET', point is at the beginning of the string you searched.
When you search forwards, point is not necessarily at the end of the string you
were searching for, but only after the last character that you typed
-- bad usability!  That means that you cannot predict point
based on the string you are searching for (and thinking about).  You
must predict point based on the numbers of characters you typed.

Here is how to change that in your InitFile, courtesy of AdrianKubala:

    (add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook 'my-goto-match-beginning)
    (defun my-goto-match-beginning ()
      (when (and isearch-forward isearch-other-end)
        (goto-char isearch-other-end)))

    (defadvice isearch-exit (after my-goto-match-beginning activate)
      "Go to beginning of match."
      (when (and isearch-forward isearch-other-end)
        (goto-char isearch-other-end)))

With this hook, both `C-g' and `RET' exit the search at the begining of the search string. To recover the old behaviour of `C-g' (going back to where you where before starting the search), you can change the hook to (only tested on Emacs 22):

    (defun my-goto-match-beginning ()
      (when (and isearch-forward isearch-other-end (not isearch-mode-end-hook-quit))
        (goto-char isearch-other-end)))


'''''Tip:''''' To get back to where you started the search, just use `C-x C-x'. This works because isearch sets the mark at the search start (if point ends up elsewhere after searching).

''Note:'' Emacs 21 currently has a bug in that `isearch-mode-end-hook' is called ''after'' `C-g' exits an isearch. That means that if you end a search with `C-g' you cannot use `C-x C-x' to get back to where you were before searching.
[new:DrewAdams:2004-12-25 17:33 UTC]
Since I submitted that bug, I've heard back that it will be corrected in the next GNU Emacs release. -- DrewAdams
[new]

Another way to get the functionality of jumping to the beginning of the search-term is simply adding a little wrapper function and binding it to a different key. I find C-v a good candidate, you don't usually want to jump to next page when searching:

    (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-v") 'my-isearch-forward-to-beginning)
    (defun my-isearch-forward-to-beginning ()
      "Do a forward search and jump to the beginning of the search-term."
      (interactive)
      (isearch-repeat 'forward)
      (goto-char isearch-other-end))

Now you can use C-s to search normally (point at end) and C-v to make point jump to beginning. Alternatively, you can swap these two keys if you prefer the new behaviour more often.

    (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-s") 'my-isearch-forward-to-beginning)
    (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "C-v") 'isearch-repeat-forward)

[:IciclesSearch]
== Icicles Search: Another Way to Search Incrementally ==

Besides enhancing Isearch completion (see [[#MoreIsearchKeys]], above), '''[[Icicles]]''' provides an additional, unusual way of searching incrementally that is akin to both isearch and `occur' -- but weirder! The explanation is here: [[Icicles - Search Commands, Overview]]. Highlights:

* Perform a regexp search for ''search contexts'' in a buffer, the region, multiple buffers, or multiple saved regions. You can limit the contexts to matches of a regexp subgroup, if you want. 

* (Optional) Search incrementally ''within'' the search contexts, using another, fine-tuning regexp -- that is, filter all of the original hits at once, using a second regexp.

* (Optional) Hit a key to ''replace'' the current search hit with different text at any time, or replace all search hits.

"Incremental" has a double meaning here:

* You can change your (optional) fine-tuning regexp on the fly, and see the changes among the original search hits.

* You can move incrementally among search hits in the target buffer(s).

Here is some more info about Isearch:

* [[Iedit]] -- Replace multiple occurrences of the Isearch string. [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2010-02/msg00000.html]
* IsearchOtherEnd -- Use Isearch to navigate buffers by controlling the point behavior.
* KillISearchMatch -- Bind C-k in isearch to kill the match
* SearchingTheMinibuffer -- How to use Isearch in the mini-buffer.
* SearchAtPoint -- A feature from VI that is useful to programmers.  Also shows how to extend Isearch.
* FlexIsearch -- A minor mode that, if there is no exact match to the search string, causes the search string to be transformed into a regexp that matches the original and also similar strings.  It is like flex matching in ido (InteractivelyDoThings).  E.g. "aeiou" would match "abstemious".


I often search for a string which I want to grab and paste elsewhere:
So I want to find it, mark it, and kill it.
I can use C-w/C-z to extend the search string (either by word or by sexp), and then I just want to grab is somehow:  I think it's natural to bind it to M-w.

Here's how:

  (defun isearch-save-and-exit ()
     "Exit search normally. and save the `search-string' on kill-ring."
    (interactive)
    (isearch-done)
    (isearch-clean-overlays)
    (kill-new isearch-string))
 
  (define-key isearch-mode-map    "\M-w" 'isearch-save-and-exit)
