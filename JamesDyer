My name is James Dyer, and I have been using Emacs for almost 30 years.

I started my journey when I was at Aston University learning Ada, around 1994.

I have a blog where I write about Emacs at https://www.emacs.dyerdwelling.family/

My Emacs configuration uses [https://www.emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/emacs--init.html Literate programming]

I maintain an Emacs package on MELPA [https://melpa.org/#/selected-window-accent-mode selected-window-accent-mode]

My daily driver is the Sway Window Manager with Emacs 29.

I use Emacs for everything, except digital art of course but maybe one day I will fully embrace Artist Mode!
