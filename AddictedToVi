This is a piece of humor on the GnuProject Web 
site[http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/vi.song.html]:


  As you sing this, it may help the effect to imagine a dozen women, all of
  whom resemble Bill Joy, dressed in black and dancing sinuously.
  
  Addicted To vi
  (with apologies to Robert Palmer)
  
  You press the keys with no effect,
  Your mode is not correct.
  The screen blurs, your fingers shake;
  You forgot to press escape.
  Can't insert, can't delete,
  Cursor keys won't repeat.
  You try to quit, but can't leave,
  An extra "bang" is all you need.
  
  You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
  Oh yeah?
  You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
  You know you're gonna have to face it;
  You're addicted to vi!
  
  You edit files one at a time;
  That doesn't seem too out of line?
  You don't think of keys to bind--
  A meta key would blow your mind.
  H, J, K, L?  You're not annoyed?
  Expressions must be a Joy!
  Just press "f", or is it "t"?
  Maybe "n", or just "g"?
  
  Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
  Oh yeah?
  You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
  You know you're gonna have to face it;
  You're addicted to vi!
  
  Might as well face it,
  You're addicted to vi!
  
  You press the keys without effect,
  Your life is now a wreck.
  What a waste!  Such a shame!
  And all you have is vi to blame.
  
  Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
  Oh yeah?
  You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
  You know you're gonna have to face it;
  You're addicted to vi!
  
  Might as well face it,
  You're addicted to vi!
