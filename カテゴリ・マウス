Emacsでマウスを使うことに関連するページのリストの見出しをクリック.

このカテゴリはEmacsでマウスを使うことについてです.
それは以下のことについてのトピックを含みます:

* マウス[[pointer]] -- マウスポジションのグラフィックインディケータ.
Common pointer symbols used in Emacs include an arrow, an hourglass, an ''I''-bar, and a pointing finger.
* `mouse-face' property -- [[text property|Text property]] whose value is a face that is seen only when the mouse is over text with that property.
When it is shown, faces used for the `face' text property are not shown.
Typically, `mouse-face' highlighting indicates that clicking the mouse on the highlighted text will perform an action that is different from clicking it elsewhere.
Hypertext links are often highlighted using property `mouse-face'.
* ''mouse actions'' -- Use of mouse buttons, a mouse wheel, and mouse motion in Emacs.
Mouse actions are a subset of key sequences (see CategoryKeys).

Standard Emacs uses of mouse buttons include setting the [[cursor]] position ([[point]]),  editing text (copy, cut, paste), and following hyperlinks.
Pages dealing with mouse actions and configuring the mouse (buttons, wheel) are included in category Mouse.

Otherwise, category Mouse does ''not'' include topics that merely mention mouse bindings, unless those bindings do something specifically related to the mouse.
This also means that Category Mouse does not include topics about mouse-initiated menus (popup menus), except information on how to bind menus to mouse actions or information about menus that pertain to the mouse itself.

In sum, if a page teaches you something about the mouse or about extending use of the mouse, then it belongs in CategoryMouse.

* ArtistMode -- Draw freehand with the mouse.
