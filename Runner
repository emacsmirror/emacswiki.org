This library allows for a set of shell commands to be linked with file or directory names. These commands can then be used in [[DiredMode]] using `dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!"). Since this library modifies the behavior of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user', the command syntax will follow that variable's syntax (see the documentation of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' for more).

Features: 

* Provides a widget.el interface to add, edit, and sort shell
  commands.

* Gets rid of the "A command is running - kill it? Yes or No?"
  message.

* If `runner-run-in-background' is set to t, send the stdout buffer
  to the background except when the command string includes
  `{run:out}'.

* If the command string contains `{run:shell}', run the command
  using the function specified in `runner-shell-function'.

==Download==

Lisp:runner.el

== Install ==

Put this file in your Emacs-Lisp load path, and add the following
into your $HOME/.emacs startup file.

 (require 'runner)

== Usage ==

While in dired mode, position point on any file or directory you
wish to add a shell command to, then do:

 M-x runner-add-file (for file or directory names)
 M-x runner-add-extension (for file extension)

A new buffer will be created allowing you to specify what commands
to run.

A file name or extension can be linked to multiple set of
commands. You can view and edit which pattern is being applied to a
file by positioning point on a file and running,

 M-x runner-edit-file-at-point

You can also add, edit, or delete any specific pattern by doing:

 M-x runner-add-empty
 M-x runner-edit
 M-x runner-delete

The command database will be saved to the variable
`runner-init-file' (default is "~/.emacs.d/runner-conf.el"). You
may choose a different location by doing:

 M-x customize-variable runner-init-file

The functions `dired-guess-default' (from dired-x.el) and
`dired-run-shell-command' (from dired-aux.el) will be redefined.
