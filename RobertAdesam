== ∃x∀y(Emacs(x)∧(Person(y)→♥(y,x))) ==

I have been using Emacs since 1994 and use it on Mac OS X, Linux,
Solaris, and sometimes on Windows. It has not been the smoothest ride,
I have tried to exchange Emacs for other tools like Eclipse,
!NetBeans, Thunderbird, Mail.app etc, but I have given up. Emacs is
for me.

== Emacs Daily Usage ==

I use Emacs daily for
* [CategoryViewMail reading/writing my Email],
* [OrgMode organising] my life,
* [AUCTeX writing papers], and of course for
* programming.

== Init Files ==

* RobertAdesamConfig -- the Mac Mini @work running Mac OS 10.5; the/
!ThinkPad @work running Mandriva 2010 and Windows 7 Enterprise; and my Samsung netbook @home running Windows 7 Starter.
* RobertAdesamEmacsClientBat -- bat file for starting emacsclientw.exe on my netbook @home running Windows 7 Starter. On my blog I posted [http://robert-adesam.blogspot.com/2011/01/emacsclient-setup-on-windows-7-starter.html how I use it].

== Hacks ==

* RobertAdesamMairixPatch -- quick fix for running Mairix on Windows NT Emacs, see [http://robert-adesam.blogspot.com/2011/05/mairix-on-windows-nt-emacs.html my blog post] for more info.

== Contact ==

You can reach me via
* email [mailto:robert@adesam.se robert@adesam.se], and my web site at
* URL http://www.adesam.se/robert/

I also started a [http://robert-adesam.blogspot.com blog] where I am presumably going to write about Emacs related things.

Please put your blog on Plane Emacs so that I can follow it -- IvanKanis
