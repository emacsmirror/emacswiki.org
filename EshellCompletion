== Customization ==

Eshell offers you completion of filenames.  If several filenames are
possible, the most recently modified file will be used first.

This is determined by `eshell-cmpl-compare-entry-function' and
defaults to `file-newer-than-file-p'.  The idea is that once you start
working with a certain file, you will want it to appear first in your
completion list.

Here's some untested code to reverse this order, and to take
`completion-ignored-extensions' into account.

 (setq eshell-cmpl-compare-entry-function
       (function
	(lambda (left right)
	  (let ((exts completion-ignored-extensions) found)
	    (while exts
	      (if (string-match (concat "\\" (car exts) "$") right)
		  (setq found t exts nil))
	      (setq exts (cdr exts)))
	    (if found
		nil
	      (file-newer-than-file-p left right))))))

== Remote Files ==

If I want to change directory to /scratch, then pressing TAB after typing "cd /sc" leads to TrampMode trying to open a connection. This is because the tramp-completion-file-name-handler entry in file-name-handler-alist leads to:

 (file-name-all-completions "sc" "/") =>
  ("scpx:" "scp2_old:" "scp1_old:" "scp2:" "scp1:" "scp:" "scratch/")

and pcomplete tries to run file-directory-p on all these entries.

One way to avoid this is to use the following:

 (defadvice pcomplete (around avoid-remote-connections activate)
   (let ((file-name-handler-alist (copy-alist file-name-handler-alist)))
     (setq file-name-handler-alist
           (delete (rassoc 'tramp-completion-file-name-handler
                           file-name-handler-alist) file-name-handler-alist))
     ad-do-it))

Note that completion of "cd /su::/" still works because this is
handled by tramp-file-name-handler.

Perhaps there are better ways of doing this? -- Matt Hodges

== Miscellaneous ==

If I set my own prompt, like this:

 (setq eshell-prompt-function
       (lambda ()
         (concat "[" (user-login-name) "@" (system-name) " " (eshell/pwd) "]"
                 (if (= (user-uid) 0) "# " "$ "))))

completion stops working. When I press tab, I get the message "Text is read-only". Can anyone explain this? -- [[bkhl]]

: This happens because you haven't modified eshell-prompt-regexp accordingly (see the documentation for eshell-prompt-function). This should work:

 (setq eshell-prompt-regexp "^[^#$\n]*[#$] ")

: See EshellFunctions for more examples. -- MattHodges

Ok, thanks. I like pcomplete-list better than the completion cycling. I tried this:

 (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
           '(lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map "\t" 'pcomplete-list)))

but it doesn't work. How should this be done properly? -- [[bkhl]]

: I use:

 (setq eshell-cmpl-cycle-completions nil)

: to avoid completion cycling. -- MattHodges

== AutoComplete ==

I use the amazing AutoComplete package for completion. Eshell provides
completion through the ProgrammableCompletion package. I did not found
a suitable auto-complete source for pcomplete, so I use the following
code:

<pre>
(defun ac-pcomplete ()
  ;; eshell uses `insert-and-inherit' to insert a \t if no completion
  ;; can be found, but this must not happen as auto-complete source
  (flet ((insert-and-inherit (&rest args)))
    ;; this code is stolen from `pcomplete' in pcomplete.el
    (let* (tramp-mode ;; do not automatically complete remote stuff
           (pcomplete-stub)
           (pcomplete-show-list t) ;; inhibit patterns like * being deleted
           pcomplete-seen pcomplete-norm-func
           pcomplete-args pcomplete-last pcomplete-index
           (pcomplete-autolist pcomplete-autolist)
           (pcomplete-suffix-list pcomplete-suffix-list)
           (candidates (pcomplete-completions))
           (beg (pcomplete-begin))
           ;; note, buffer text and completion argument may be
           ;; different because the buffer text may bet transformed
           ;; before being completed (e.g. variables like $HOME may be
           ;; expanded)
           (buftext (buffer-substring beg (point)))
           (arg (nth pcomplete-index pcomplete-args)))
      ;; we auto-complete only if the stub is non-empty and matches
      ;; the end of the buffer text
      (when (and (not (zerop (length pcomplete-stub)))
                 (or (string= pcomplete-stub ; Emacs 23
                              (substring buftext
                                         (max 0
                                              (- (length buftext)
                                                 (length pcomplete-stub)))))
                     (string= pcomplete-stub ; Emacs 24
                              (substring arg
                                         (max 0
                                              (- (length arg)
                                                 (length pcomplete-stub)))))))
        ;; Collect all possible completions for the stub. Note that
        ;; `candidates` may be a function, that's why we use
        ;; `all-completions`.
        (let* ((cnds (all-completions pcomplete-stub candidates))
               (bnds (completion-boundaries pcomplete-stub
                                            candidates
                                            nil
                                            ""))
               (skip (- (length pcomplete-stub) (car bnds))))
          ;; We replace the stub at the beginning of each candidate by
          ;; the real buffer content.
          (mapcar #'(lambda (cand) (concat buftext (substring cand skip)))
                  cnds))))))

(defvar ac-source-pcomplete
  '((candidates . ac-pcomplete)))

(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook #'(lambda () (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-pcomplete))))
(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'eshell-mode)
</pre>
