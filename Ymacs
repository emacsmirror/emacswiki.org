[http://www.ymacs.org/ Ymacs] is an Emacs-like editor for the Web --
that is, it works in a browser.  Currently it's only tested with
Firefox, and it's known to have some minor issues on Mac OS X (most key
bindings flash the Edit or File menus, which seems to be a Macintosh
“feature”).

Ymacs started out as an experiment and should still be considered so,
but it's currently quite functional.  The main goal of the project was
to make it pleasurable to write source code in the browser; using a
<code><textarea></code> it's far from convenient.

Features:

* many standard editing commands, such as text filling, movement by
  word, transposition etc.
* kill ring
* undo stack
* prefix keys (but no <kbd>ESC</kbd> for <kbd>Meta</kbd> yet,
  <kbd>Alt</kbd> should be used)
* split windows (they are called frames in Ymacs)
* multiple buffers
* autocompletion (dabbrev-expand)
* modeline and minibuffer (though minibuffer is not very functional for
  now, no <kbd>M-x</kbd>)
* interactive search
* syntax highlighting
* overlays, markers, point and mark
* transient region
* editing modes

Programming modes are provided for JavaScript, XML and Lisp -- providing
syntax highlighting and automatic indentation.
