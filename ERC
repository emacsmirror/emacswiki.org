ERC is a powerful, modular, and extensible Emacs InternetRelayChat client.

It is part of the GNU project and included in Emacs.

== Obtaining ERC ==
ERC is included in Emacs since v22.3 (released on September 2008).

For a brief history of the development of ERC and access to older versions, code repositories, and mailing list archives see ErcProjectHistory.

=== Some modules not included with GNU Emacs ===
See ErcExtraModules to find out how to get the few modules which were not able to be included with ERC in Emacs due to licensing and dependency issues.

=== Development version ===
See ErcDevelopment to find instructions on how to get the development version using git.

ERC also comes bundled with EmacsFromGit.

Note that ErcDevelopment and EmacsFromGit can contain two separate branches of ERC and are therefore not quite identical.  The modules ErcBbdb and ErcSpeak are not available in the Emacs version, for example.

=== Ports and packages ===

Gentoo users can just emerge app-emacs/erc or app-xemacs/erc (for some reason portage has a hard time figuring out which).  At present this is the latest release candidate.

== User manual ==
An info manual is included with ERC.  It's also available on-line in several forms:

# HTML (single file):https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html
# HTML (multiple files):https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/erc/index.html

== Quickstart ==

* To connect, call M-x erc
* To customize how ERC works: M-x customize-group RET erc RET
* ERC comes with a lot of small modules that do stuff for you.  Recent versions of ERC let you just M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules RET.

== Introduction ==

* ErcFeatures -- an overall idea of ERC features
* ErcBasics -- for those new to both ERC and IRC
* ErcIntroduction -- for those who are familiar with IRC clients but are new to ERC
* ErcLoading -- what to put in your InitFile file to get ERC ready for action

* ErcEmacsChannel -- this is where the ERC folk hang out

== Setting up ERC to work right for you ==

The easiest way to configure ERC is to do M-x customize-group RET erc RET.  This will open a buffer with all possible customizable settings organized in groups.  Even if you want to add things to your Initfile manually, you might find some settings you didn't know about by looking around.

Bug: using customize to set erc-spelling-dictionaries saves the (buffername . dictionary) elements as pairs instead of lists.
