ERC is an [[IRC]] client. It is included in Emacs as of version 22.3

== Quickstart ==

Start ERC with ##M-x erc##. You will be prompted for a server, port, and nickname.

To avoid entering server info every time you run ERC, you can specify details in your InitFile like so:

{{{
;; Set our nickname & real-name as constant variables
(setq
 erc-nick "cowgirl"     ; Our IRC nick
 erc-user-full-name "Moo C") ; Our /whois name

;; Define a function to connect to a server
(defun some-serv ()
  (interactive)
  (erc :server "server.example.com"
       :port   "6667"))

;; Or assign it to a keybinding
;; This example is also using erc's TLS capabilities:
(global-set-key "\C-cen"
  (lambda ()
  (interactive)
  (erc-tls :server "server2.example.com"
           :port   "6697")))
}}}

You can see more options with ##M-x customize-group RET erc RET##

Bug: using customize to set erc-spelling-dictionaries saves the (buffername . dictionary) elements as pairs instead of lists.
