Starting with version 23, vanilla GnuEmacs introduced '''[::custom theme]s'''.  See the Emacs manual (`C-h r'), node '''[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html#Custom-Themes|Custom Themes]]'''.


[:ComparedToColorThemes]
== Comparison with Color Themes ==

Custom themes are similar to '''[[ColorThemes|color themes]]'''.  Though they are newer, they do not ''replace'' color themes –- each approach has its advantages.  Differences between them include:

* Custom themes have a [[Customize]] interface (starting with Emacs 24); color themes do not.

* Custom themes record some additional information ([[variable]]s), besides color-schemes ([[face]]s etc).

* You can easily ''undo'' color themes, even returning to the state Emacs was in before you applied any themes.  You can take a snapshot of
the current settings (independent of how they were set, whether via
color themes or not) as something that can function as a (pseudo) color theme, which you can return to.  You '''[[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=15687|cannot undo]]''' the application of custom themes, to return to the state before applying a theme.  You can only ''disable'' custom themes, not undo to a ''non-theme'' state.  That is, you can swap one custom theme for another, but any non-theme state before applying a custom theme is lost.

* Custom themes have some [[http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=15740|performance problems]].  Switching among them can be problematic.


== History ==

'''Custom themes''' were first implemented in [[XEmacs]] sometime before 2002 - the idea was to extend the Customization library to handle themes. They were ported to GnuEmacs and made part of the distribution sometime before 2005. They were quite rudimentary then.

The '''color themes''' library was developed separately. It addresses things, such as color schemes (faces), that were not covered by custom themes.  Color themes also do not use [[Customize]].

== Installation ==

In order to use custom themes, their ##.el## files have to reside in a directory contained in the `custom-theme-load-path' variable, which defaults to `~/.emacs.d'. If you want to put your themes in custom subdirectories in order not to pollute the `~/.emacs.d' folder, you can add them to the list with:

{{{
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/themes")
}}}

If you have lots of themes which you want to group inside a themes folder such as  `~/.emacs.d/themes', the following snippet allows you to conveniently add all its subfolders to the theme load path:

{{{
(let ((basedir "~/.emacs.d/themes/"))
  (dolist (f (directory-files basedir))
    (if (and (not (or (equal f ".") (equal f "..")))
             (file-directory-p (concat basedir f)))
        (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (concat basedir f)))))
}}}
