A command to shuffle the lines in a region.  Operate on the whole
buffer with `C-x h' before `M-x my-randomize-region'.

  (defun my-randomize-region (beg end)
    "Randomize lines in region from BEG to END."
    (interactive "*r")
    (let ((lines (split-string
                   (delete-and-extract-region beg end) "\n")))
      (when (string-equal "" (car (last lines 1)))
        (setq lines (butlast lines 1)))
      (apply 'insert
        (mapcar 'cdr
        (sort (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons (random) (concat x "\n"))) lines)
              (lambda (a b) (< (car a) (car b))))))))
