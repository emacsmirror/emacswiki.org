Assuming MSYS2.

Install Hunspell and the English dictionary

{{{
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-hunspell-en
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-hunspell
}}}

Download the Swiss German dictionary for Swiss German from Libre Office:

* https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/german-de-ch-frami-dictionaries

Open the .oxt file using 7-zip and extract the dictionary files:

* de_CH_frami\de_CH_frami.aff
* de_CH_frami\de_CH_frami.dic

Destination:

* C:\msys64\ucrt64\share\hunspell

Rename!

* de_CH_frami.aff → de_CH.aff
* de_CH_frami.dic → de_CH.dic

If you do not rename, then ##hunspell -D## will add an error at the end telling you that it didn't find a dictionary for your ##de_CH.UTF-8## locale. This error message cause `ispell-find-hunspell-dictionaries` to abort so there are no dictionaries to choose from when you run `ispell-change-dictionary`.

Finally, Emacs. If you set `LANG` in your `.bashrc`, you have to set it in your init file, too.

{{{
;; In case you didn't set it as a Windows environment variable
(setenv "LANG" "de_CH.UTF-8")
;; Where are the dictionaries located
(setenv "DICTPATH" "c:/msys64/ucrt64/share/hunspell/")
;; The new default dictionary, and it's definition
(setq ispell-local-dictionary "de_CH"
      ispell-local-dictionary-alist
      '(("de_CH" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil nil nil utf-8)))
}}}

Use `ispell-change-dictionary` to switch back to English.
