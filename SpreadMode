== spread.el ==

A SpreadSheet mode by GuillaumeMarceau, based on code and ideas from BenjaminPierce:

* Groups:spread.el
* http://gmarceau.qc.ca/spread.el
* https://idiomdrottning.org/spread (port to modern Emacs)

Allows to make a spreadsheet out of an ordinary text buffer. `Cells'
are text of the form:

  VALUE <= FORMULA

or

  VALUE <= FORMULA => NAME

where

* VALUE, the current value of the cell, is a single word (typically a number), or a quoted string;
* FORMULA is an arbitrary lisp expression, used to recalculate VALUE; and
* NAME, if present, is a lisp variable to which VALUE is assigned after each recomputation.

A single recalculation step consists of scanning the buffer,
recalculating each cell by replacing the current VALUE by the result
of evaluating FORMULA.  A complete recalculation, triggered by typing
\\[spread-recalc], iterates this process until the buffer stops
changing.

The buffer can also contain arbitrary free-form text between cell. This will not
interfere will the recalculations.
