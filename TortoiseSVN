== Emacsclient as external tool ==

Create the file ediff.bat with content:

{{{
SET "client=c:\GNU\emacs-24.2\bin\emacsclient.exe" 

SET "mine=%1"
CALL SET mine=%mine:\=\\%

SET "base=%2"
CALL SET base=%base:\=\\%

START /MIN %client% -c -e "(ediff""%mine%""""%base%"")"
}}}

and the file emerge.bat with content:

{{{
SET "client=c:\GNU\emacs-24.2\bin\emacsclient.exe" 

SET "mine=%1"
CALL SET mine=%mine:\=\\%

SET "theirs=%2"
CALL SET theirs=%theirs:\=\\%

SET "base=%3"
CALL SET base=%base:\=\\%

SET "merged=%4"
CALL SET merged=%merged:\=\\%

START /MIN %client% -c -e "(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor""%mine%""""%theirs""""%base%""nil""%merged%"")"
}}}

Then configure Tortoise SVN to use the previous files as external commands. For example, if you saved the files under the directory C:\Users\Dupont\Scripts\ then, in Settings>External Programs>Merge Tool, you can set:
{{{
C:\Users\Dupont\Scripts\emerge.bat %mine %theirs %base %merged
}}}
