Emacs comes with [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Database.html built-in support] for working with SQLite as of [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-29.html version 29].

The SQLite library creates and maintains a database in a single file with basic SQL commands to add data and query.  A front-end "sqlite3" program can be used interactively and for scripting.  Read more at
