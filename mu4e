*mu4e* is an email client for Emacs. It's based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] email indexer/searcher. 

:: //It's not information overload. It's filter failure. mu4e's mission is to be a better filter.// '''--Prof. Shirky'''

mu4e first appeared in ##mu 0.9.8##.

==Features==
* Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries 
* Fully documented, with example configurations
* User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for common actions
* Asynchronous; heavy actions don’t block emacs
* Support for non-English languages ("angstrom" will match "Ångström")
* Support for signing and encryption
* Address auto-completion based on your existing messages
* Extensible with your own code and many already done snippets
 
== Quickstart ==

This tutorial assumes you have use a tool such as ##mbsync## or ##mpop## to retrieve your mail into a maildir folder called ##~/mail##.

Download ##mu## from your package manager, then, from the commandline, run:

{{{
mu init --maildir=~/mail --my-address=me@example.com
}}}

From Emacs, download Mu4e with ##M-x package install RET mu4e RET## and run it with ##M-x mu4e##.

Press ##U## to update Mu4e's mail listing, and ##bu## to see all your new mail or ##j## to jump to a maildir folder.

== Tips ==

=== Context templates ===

Defining [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Contexts-example.html mu4e contexts] for multiple email accounts:

  ;; assumed Maildir layout
  ;; ~/Maildir/Account0/{Inbox,Sent,Trash}
  ;; ~/Maildir/Account1/{Inbox,Sent,Trash}
  ;; where Account0 is context name
  (defun my-make-mu4e-context (context-name full-name mail-address signature)
    "Return a mu4e context named CONTEXT-NAME with :match-func matching
  folder name CONTEXT-NAME in Maildir. The context's `user-mail-address',
  `user-full-name' and `mu4e-compose-signature' is set to MAIL-ADDRESS
  FULL-NAME and SIGNATURE respectively.

  Special folders are set to context specific folders."
    (let ((dir-name (concat "/" context-name)))
      (make-mu4e-context
       :name context-name
       ;; we match based on the maildir of the message
       ;; this matches maildir /Arkham and its sub-directories
       :match-func
       `(lambda (msg)
          (when msg
            (string-match-p
  	   ,(concat "^" dir-name)
  	   (mu4e-message-field msg :maildir))))
       :vars
       `((user-mail-address    . ,mail-address)
         (user-full-name       . ,full-name)
         (mu4e-sent-folder     . ,(concat dir-name "/Sent"))
         (mu4e-drafts-folder   . ,(concat dir-name "/Drafts"))
         (mu4e-trash-folder    . ,(concat dir-name "/Trash"))
         (mu4e-refile-folder   . ,(concat dir-name "/Archive"))
         (mu4e-compose-signature . ,signature)))))
  ;;Fixing duplicate UID errors when using mbsync and mu4e
  (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)
  
  (setq mu4e-contexts
        `(
  	,(my-make-mu4e-context
  	  "account0" "john"
  	  "john@example.org" "emacs")))

=== Integrating with mbsync ===

I use mu4e with mbsync (and GMail). Since it takes a while, mbsync runs in a cron job every 10 minutes or so, which mostly works (and I don't want mu4e to wait for a sync). However, sometimes I want to refresh my emails now ("Hey, I just sent you something..."). This code changes the meaning of the prefix argument to "U" so that it re-syncs when given a prefix and doesn't otherwise.

    (setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync gmail")

    ;; Most of the time, I merely want mu4e to re-index my local maildir (because
    ;; I'm running mbsync as a cron job). However, sometimes I want to fetch mails
    ;; immediately. Do this by changing the meaning of a prefix for
    ;; mu4e-update-mail-and-index (bound to "U").
    ;;
    ;; A prefix usually means run in the background, but I don't think I ever want
    ;; that. Change things so a prefix means to call mbsync.
    (defun rjs/mu4e-update-mail-and-index (orig-fun prefix &rest args)
      (interactive "P")
      (if prefix (funcall orig-fun nil) (mu4e-update-index)))

    (advice-add 'mu4e-update-mail-and-index
                :around #'rjs/mu4e-update-mail-and-index)
