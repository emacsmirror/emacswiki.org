*mu4e* is a new emacs-based e-mail client. It's based on the [http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu mu] e-mail indexer/searcher. It focuses on being a super-efficient tool to withstand the daily e-mail tsunami. 

==Features==
* Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries
* Fully documented, with example configurations
* User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for common actions
* Asynchronous; heavy actions don’t block emacs
* Support for non-English languages ("angstrom" will match "Ångström")
* Support for crypto
* Writing rich-text e-mails using org-mode
* Address auto-completion based on your messages
* Extensible with your own code

It's pretty new - it's first release is as part of mu 0.9.8, end of January 2012. I've been happily using it for a few months; hopefully it works well for others as well.

Message view action: Open message at point in the default external browser

    ;;; message view action
    (defun mu4e-msgv-action-view-in-browser (msg)
      "View the body of the message in a web browser."
      (interactive)
      (let ((html (mu4e-msg-field (mu4e-message-at-point t) :body-html))
            (tmpfile (format "%s/%d.html" temporary-file-directory (random))))
        (unless html (error "No html part for this message"))
        (with-temp-file tmpfile
        (insert
            "<html>"
            "<head><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\""
            "content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\">"
           html))
        (browse-url (concat "file://" tmpfile))))
    (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions
      '("View in browser" . mu4e-msgv-action-view-in-browser) t)
