= Hydra, the keybinding package =

Project page: https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra

Hydra allows you to create keymaps for related commands, with the ability to easily repeat commands by using a single keystroke. Here is a small example:

    (defhydra hydra-zoom (global-map "<f2>")
      "zoom"
      ("g" text-scale-increase "in")
      ("l" text-scale-decrease "out"))

With this code, typing `<f2> g g g' would increase the text size by three steps.
