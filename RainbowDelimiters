<b>[[RainbowDelimiters]]</b> is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which highlights parens, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted a different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at the same depth.

Great care has been taken to make this mode fast. You shouldn’t see any change in scrolling or editing speed even with delimiter-rich languages like Clojure or EmacsLisp.

You can customize the color scheme [[RainbowDelimiters]] uses. The color scheme it comes with is intentionally subtle.

* Current: <b>1.3.4</b> (2012-04-27)
** Further improve highlighting speed. Benchmarks show 2x improvement.
** Eliminate bottleneck seen in certain large files.
*** A large file which had this now highlights ~40x faster.
** Color scheme for light backgrounds.
** Correct broken/incorrect highlighting reported in certain languages.

* Overview:
** Highlights parens, brackets, braces.
** global-rainbow-delimiters mode: Use rainbow-delimiters editor-wide.
** Checkboxes to enable/disable highlighting of each type of delimiter.
** Customizable color scheme works with deftheme and color-theme.el.
** Infinite nesting depth by cycling through faces repeatedly.


= Setup instructions: =
1. Download rainbow-delimiters.el from git and add it to your emacs load-path.

2. Byte-compile the file (*necessary for speed*):
<pre>
M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
</pre>

3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
<pre>
(require 'rainbow-delimiters)
</pre>

4. Enable the mode in your dot-emacs/init file. You can either use it only in certain editing modes, or use it Emacs-wide:

- To *use only with specific modes*, add lines like the following:
<pre>
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

- To *enable in all programming-related modes* (Emacs 24+):
<pre>
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
</pre>

- To *use Emacs-wide*, add this line:
<pre>
(global-rainbow-delimiters-mode)

</pre>

To /toggle/ rainbow-delimiters mode while Emacs is running:

<code>        - </code>In a single buffer:
<code> M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode </code>

<code>        - </code>Globally (all buffers):
<code> M-x global-rainbow-delimiters-mode </code>

== Customization: ==

To *customize rainbow-delimiters mode*, you can use:
<pre>
M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
</pre>

=== Color Scheme ===
customize-group <code>rainbow-delimiters-faces</code> has the faces for successive nested pairs of delimiters. You can change them through emacs customize or in your color theme or dot-emacs.

The face <code>rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face</code> is used for unmatched closing delimiters.

Zenburn and Solarized themes have their own colors for these faces.

*deftheme*/color-theme.el: Further information is at the top of rainbow-delimiters.el.


=== Stop Highlighting Certain Delimiters ===
You can *disable highlighting* of any of the supported delimiter types through the customize interface, in the *Toggle Delimiters* section.


== Other Information ==
Rainbow-delimiters comes with two *default color schemes*, for light and dark backgrounds. Emacs chooses which to used based on the value of variable 'frame-background-mode'.
