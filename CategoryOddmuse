== CAPTCHA ==

If you're trying to use EmacsWiki using HTTP requests, you need to tell the wiki that you have already answered the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA CAPTCHA].
You do this by using the URL parameter `uihnscuskc=1'. This will return a *cookie* which you can use---or you can simply continue to provide the "secret" URL parameter.
