[[Oddmuse]] is the wiki engine used to run EmacsWiki.
Oddmuse modes are Emacs modes that help you read and edit Oddmuse wikis such as Emacs Wiki using Emacs itself.

* OddmuseMode is maintained by XavierMaillard [note: this doesn't appear available at Savannah as of June 2025, and I haven't been able to find another copy.]
* [[Oddmuse Mode]] is now maintained by [[Alex Schroeder]] 
* [[Yaoddmuse]] is maintained by [[rubikitch]]

See WikiModes for similar stuff, and also RuseWikiMode is based on OddmuseMode.

== CAPTCHA ==

If you're trying to use EmacsWiki using HTTP requests, you need to tell the wiki that you have already answered the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA CAPTCHA].
You do this by using the URL parameter ##uihnscuskc=1##. This will return a *cookie* which you can use---or you can simply continue to provide the "secret" URL parameter.
