Lots of spam-fighting today. Here's what the wiki has to offer, if you're an administrator:

- ban URL's containing regular expressions via [[BannedContent]] (weird page name, I know)
- ban page content containing regular expressions via [[BannedRegexps]] (this is much more sweeping and I don't like to use it)
- ban IP numbers using regular expressions via [[BannedHosts]] (regular expressions is a stupid idea but I never got around to CIDR matching)

Also, there's a little helper that lists all the IP numbers and the usernames they used and whether they are already banned, e.g. [Self:action=ban;id=Comments_on_SiteMap ban contributors to Comments on SiteMap].
