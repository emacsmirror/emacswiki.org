Devil is a key interception and translation package for GNU Emacs. It offers a global minor mode to intercept keystrokes and translate them to Emacs key sequences according to a configurable set of translation rules. For example, with the default translation rules, when we type <kbd>, x , f</kbd>, Devil translates it to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and runs the command bound to this key sequence.

Devil can be most easily installed from MELPA. MELPA can be added as a package source in Emacs with Elisp code like this:

{{{
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
}}}

Assuming MELPA has been added as a package source in your Emacs, Devil can be installed easily with these commands:

{{{
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
M-x package-install RET devil RET
}}}

To enable Devil mode, type the following command:

{{{
M-x global-devil-mode RET
}}}

Finally, type <kbd>, x , f</kbd> and watch Devil translate it to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and invoke the corresponding `find-file' command.

See the project README at https://github.com/susam/devil for more examples of key sequences and details on how to customize Devil.
