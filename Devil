Devil is a key interception and translation package for GNU Emacs. It offers a global minor mode to intercept keystrokes and translate them to Emacs key sequences according to a configurable set of translation rules. For example, with the default translation rules, when we type <kbd>, x , f</kbd>, Devil translates it to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and runs the command bound to this key sequence.

To quickly get started with Devil, first clone it from its Git repository:

{{{
git clone https://github.com/susam/devil.git
}}}

Then add the following to your Emacs initialization file:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/devil/")
(require 'devil)
(global-devil-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-,") 'global-devil-mode)
}}}

Then type <kbd>, x , f</kbd> and watch Devil translate it to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and invoke the find file functionality. See the project README at https://github.com/susam/devil for more examples of key sequences and details on how to customize Devil.
