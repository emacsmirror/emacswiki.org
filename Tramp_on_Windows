Install [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html PuTTY] and make sure ##plink.exe## is on your PATH.

Now you can use something like the following: ##/plink:alex@example.org##.

If you always use the ##plink## method, you can make it the default:

{{{
(setq tramp-default-method "plink")
}}}

Or you can put it all together like this such that your init file will work for both Windows and other operating systems:

{{{
(when (eq window-system 'w32)
  (setq tramp-default-method "plink")
  (when (and (not (string-match putty-directory (getenv "PATH")))
	     (file-directory-p putty-directory))
    (setenv "PATH" (concat putty-directory ";" (getenv "PATH")))
    (add-to-list 'exec-path putty-directory)))
}}}

If you use ##pscp## instead of ##plink##, ##tramp-do-copy-or-rename-file-out-of-band## will do ##executable-find## for the ##copy-program##, and ##executable-find## will search on ##exec-path##, not on ##(getenv PATH)##. I assume ##exec-path## is initialised from ##(getenv PATH)## (also see [[ExecPath]]), but they are not automatically kept in sync, so we have to do it ourselves.

If you need to specify additional properties for your connection (like a private key file, keepalives, etc) one easy way is to create and save a session with your desired properties in PuTTY's gui program and then connect using your saved session by ##C-x## ##C-f## then
{{{
/plinkx:sessname:/path/to/your/file/on/server
}}}
where ##sessname## is the name of your saved session in PuTTY.
