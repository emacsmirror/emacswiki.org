I'm Tim Chambers 1E4AF729D5CEFFD0. I love GnuEmacs. My initials are tbc. I'm an alum of MIT and started using emacs in January, 1981. It was written by RMS in TECO and ran on a DECSYSTEM-20 from a VT100 monochrome terminal.

Sad to learn evernote-mode.el ([https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode by pymander]) has no maintainer. [https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode/issues/38#issuecomment-1431856227 Left a note of thanks].

Haven't made it to a meetup yet. Halfway through HRS' Org-mode talk (YouTube). Googled emacs philosophy today. Discovered Emacs is Dead. Also thinking about ViAndEmacs. What I want to do is explain what ''I'' mean by Emacs as an operating system. I sympathize with HRS, but my take is a little different. Pondering...

I no longer know what I meant by "library changes" in my contributions section below, and part of the URL set off the spam detector. This is just to remind me that I once cared.

''What I said March 18th on IRC at work.'' I wouldn't recommend using Emacs unless one has an instance running all the time, uses emacsclient to edit from shells on the same machine, and uses TRAMP to edit remote files. Emacs is a UI to the OS. For quickly editing files I myself use vi or, occasionally, gedit.

To which I add: I refuse to use Emacs without my customizations.

Also, I joined the [https://plus.google.com/communities/101818454981911211159 Church of Emacs] but fear I will be banned as a heretic.

''19 Oct 13'' EasyPG rocks!

If you're the first one to guess my email and write to me, I'll buy you a beverage of your choice next time we meet face to face [1]. Mention you saw the offer here, please, so I can update this page. This is sort of a hobby of mine. I have open beverage debts going back to March, 2010. Really. I’d like to buy you a beverage.

[1] Within reason. No premium aged scotch, no champagne from Champagne, no Belgian Chimay beer, no Kopi Luwak. I trust you get the idea.
