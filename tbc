I'm Tim Chambers 1E4AF729D5CEFFD0. I love GnuEmacs. My initials are tbc. I'm an alum of MIT and started using emacs in January, 1981. It was written by RMS in TECO and ran on a DECSYSTEM-20 from a VT100 monochrome terminal.

If you're the first one to guess my email and write to me, I'll buy you a beverage of your choice next time we meet face to face [1]. Mention you saw the offer here, please, so I can update this page. This is sort of a hobby of mine. I have open beverage debts going back to March, 2010. Really. I’d like to buy you a beverage.

[1] Within reason. No premium aged scotch, no champagne from Champagne, no Belgian Chimay beer, no Kopi Luwak. I trust you get the idea.

Thanks, Drew! I don't see email from you, but I'll make a special exception since you're the first to send me WikiMail. :) Next time you're in Colorado, give me a call (or SMS): +1 719.357.7822. I'll buy you a Duvel. – Tim
