In my .emacs I have the follow setting:

(define-key evil-motion-state-map "\C-u" 'scroll-up-command)
This works well.

But what if I wanted to change it to spacebar or Return key?

(define-key evil-motion-state-map "<return>" 'scroll-up-command)
(define-key evil-motion-state-map "SPC" 'scroll-up-command)
Nothing spectular will happen, the return/Enter key and spacebar are behaving their standard behaviour. I looked around for the right keys, and it seems they're the rights keys. For example,

(global-set-key (kbd "<return>") 'save-buffer) 
Works fine.

What am I doing wrong in Emacs/Evil with the Enter key?

ReneFroger, This works :
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "RET") 'scroll-up)
Though I don't know much about lisp or programming for that matter. Copy pasted and changed from some existing lines in .emacs

You should '''''never''''' bind `C-u'.  It is important that it remain bound to command `universal-argument'.  If not, you are inviting trouble throughout Emacs.

The quick install instructions are wrong. Somebody who cares about evil-mode should fix them

Yes, "quick install instructions" are missing one line:

<code>(package-initialize)</code>

Someone please fix, I spent 1 hr looking into this issue, somehow I got to [http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el Package.el]. From there I was able to figure it out, under "configuration"

My ~/.emacs:

<code>
(require 'package)
(push '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
    package-archives )
(push '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")
    package-archives)

(package-initialize)
</code>

Thanks

Are the official docs moved?

Would be good to have a note about evil-collection but I can't seem to edit this page.
