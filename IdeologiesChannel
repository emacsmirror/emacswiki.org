; ideology (n): an orientation that characterizes the thinking of a group or nation [syn: {political orientation}, {political theory}] (WordNet)

The channel #ideologies on irc.freenode.net is about the discussion of
different political and economical ideologies.

It was founded by Odin, xerox, forcer and hsh on 2005-03-04 when yet
another lengthy debate on #emacs (EmacsChannel) disturbed an on-topic
discussion to help with some emacs issue.

Feel free to join and discuss :-)
