[:Introduction]
== Introduction: On Beyond Occur... ==

You've no doubt used standard Emacs command `occur' (OccurMode).  It finds all
lines in a buffer that match a [[regexp]] that you enter.  It displays
the matching [[line]]s as links in buffer `*Occur*' -- you can click a
link to navigate to the corresponding line in the original buffer.
Using buffer `*Occur*' is similar to using the output of the Emacs
`grep' command.

Command '''`icicle-occur'''' is similar to `occur', but instead of
entering a regexp (with `RET') you type a regexp and then use
`S-TAB' to show the matching lines  in buffer `*Completions*'.  As
usual in '''Icicles''', you can complete to a single candidate, or [[Icicles - Cycling Completions|cycle]]
among candidates to choose one.  To navigate to a match in the
original buffer, use `C-RET', `C-mouse-2', `C-next', or `C-prior'. One advantage of `icicle-occur' over `occur' is that you can change the regexp
on the fly to match different sets of lines.

Another, major advantage is that you can use [[progressive completion]] to find lines using multiple regexps.  A similar,
but less interactive, effect can be had using chained `grep'
commands, but it is otherwise not possible with other search
methods such as [[regexp]] [[Isearch]].  A regexp simply cannot express
intersection ("and") except in the limited form of "followed by".

Here's a screenshot of using `icicle-occur' to find lines that match the regexp `##regexp.*match##'. The text matching the input regexp is highlighted with green. The line highlighted with pink corresponds to the current candidate during cycling (with `C-next'). The current cycling candidate is shown in the [[minibuffer]] and is highlighted in `*Completions*'.

For more about `icicle-occur', see OccurMode.


[:ContextRegexp--definition]
[:SearchContext--definition]
Command '''`icicle-search'''' is a generalization of `icicle-occur'.
You enter an initial, search-'''[::context regexp]''' (using `RET'), which defines
a set of completion candidates: all of the matching strings in the
current buffer (by default).  These candidates are called '''[::search context]s'''.

Command `icicle-occur' is really `icicle-search'
with an implicit initial regexp of '''`##.*##'''' (which you do not enter, however).  For `icicle-occur', the search contexts, that is,
the initial completion candidates, are all of
the ''lines'' of the buffer.  ('''`##.##'''' matches any character except a
newline).

This means that `icicle-occur' does not, like `grep' and `occur',
give you just one chance to filter the lines by providing a regexp
to match.  It lets you dynamically change the filtering regexp,
changing the search hits on the fly.  That is the general idea of
'''Icicles''' search: define search contexts, then filter them
dynamically by matching your current minibuffer input.

What if you want to start out with only a subset of the buffer
lines, and then match those dynamically -- in other words, you are
sure you want to limit your searching to only some of the lines?
In that case, you just use `icicle-search', not `icicle-occur',
providing it with a context-defining regexp that matches only the
lines you want.

For example, you might use '''##‘.*for.*’##''', to start
with only the lines containing `for' as the contexts to search.
Again, `icicle-occur' is just a shortcut version of
`icicle-search' for the common case where you want to dynamically
match any of the lines.

More generally, with `icicle-search', the candidates need ''not'' be single, complete [[line]]s; they can be any
strings in the buffer, including ''multiple-line'' strings.  Your
initial regexp is used over and over to
find the set of matching strings in the region or buffer that you search.  These strings then serve as the completion candidates.

For example, you might use a search-context regexp of "##[A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!]##"
to search ''sentences'', "##\\(.+\n\\)+##" to search ''paragraphs'', or 
"##\\([^\f]*[\f]\\|[^\f]+$\\)##" to search ''pages''.  (`##^L##' is the page-separator character.  (That's in fact how convenience commands
'''`icicles-search-sentences'''', '''`icicles-search-paragraphs'''', and
'''`icicles-search-pages'''' are defined.)

`##\f##' is the form-feed, or page-separator, character.  You input
`##\f##', `##\t##', and `##\n##' using `C-q l', `C-q TAB', and `C-j',
respectively.  See [[Icicles - Dot, Dot, Dot]] for information about
''multi-line dot'' ('''`##.##''''), which matches also newline.

Again, you can use [[progressive completion]] (`M-*' or `S-SPC') to match several
different regexps within the same page or the same sentence.  For
example, you could find all sentences that contain `character',
`delete', and `backward', in any order, as follows:

  C-c ` [A-Z][^.?!]+[.?!] RET character S-SPC delete S-SPC backward

When you visit a search context, both
`icicle-occur' and `icicle-search' highlight that hit.  For
`icicle-occur', the search context is the current ''line''.  For
`icicle-search', it is whatever your search-context regexp matches.

[:IciclesSearchKeyBindings]
== Icicles Search Key Bindings ==

There are many '''Icicles''' search commands, most of which are bound to
keys when you are in ''Icicle'' minor mode.  They are all placed on
the same prefix key, '''`M-s M-s''''.  Starting with Emacs 23, a single
`M-s' is the standard Emacs prefix key for search.  Just hit the
key twice for '''Icicles''' search.

The most general '''Icicles''' search command is '''`icicle-search'''', which
is bound to '''`M-s M-s M-s''''.  It is also bound to '''`##C-c `##''''.  (In some
modes these keys are bound to a mode-specific form of '''Icicles'''
search.)

The '''Icicles''' search keys are generally mnemonic.  Some of the
commands also have an alternative key binding (in parentheses in
the list below).

Remember too that you can also invoke some of these same commands
using a prefix arg with the generic `icicle-search' keys.  For
example, you can invoke the commands bound to `M-s M-s m' using a
zero prefix arg with `icicle-search' -- e.g., `C-0 M-s M-s M-s'  or `##C-0 C-c `##'.

Here are the suffix keys on the `M-s M-s' prefix key:

* '''`M-s'''' -- `icicle-search'   -- Seach buffer areas that match regexp ('''`##C-c `##'''')
* '''`M-s'''' -- `icicle-comint-search' -- Retrieve a previous shell input ('''`##C-c `##'''')
* '''`M-s'''' -- `icicle-compilation-search' -- Search compilation hits -- e.g `grep' hits ('''`##C-c `##'''')
* '''`##,##'''' -- `icicle-tags-search' -- Search files listed in TAGS table

* '''`D'''' -- `icicle-search-defs-full' (aka `icicle-imenu-full') full definitions as completion candidates
* '''`f'''' -- `icicle-search-file' ('''`C--'''') -- Search selected files
* '''`i'''' -- `icicle-imenu' (aka `icicle-search-defs') - Navigate among [[ImenuMode|Imenu]] entries ('''`##C-c =##'''')
* '''`I'''' -- `icicle-imenu-full' (aka `icicle-search-defs-full') full definitions as completion candidates
**           `icicle-imenu-command' -- [[command]] definitions
**           `icicle-imenu-face' -- [[face]] definitions
**           `icicle-imenu-macro' -- [[macro]] definitions
**           `icicle-imenu-non-interactive-function' -- non-interactive function definitions
**           `icicle-imenu-user-option' -- user [[option]] definitions
**          `icicle-imenu-key-explicit-map' -- [[key]] definitions
**           `icicle-imenu-key-implicit-map' -- key definitions
* '''`j'''' -- `icicle-search-bookmark'  -- Search bookmarks
**           `icicle-search-*-bookmark'   -- Bookmarks of a given type
* '''`J'''' -- `icicle-search-bookmarks-together' ('''`C-u''''),
* '''`k'''' -- `icicle-search-keywords' -- Search with [[regexp]] keywords ('''`##C-c ^##'''')
* '''`l'''' -- `icicle-search-lines' (aka `icicle-occur') ('''`##C-c '##'''')
* '''`C-l'''' -- `icicle-search-pages' -- Search Emacs pages  (##^L##/form-feed delimited) as contexts
* '''`m'''' -- `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked' -- Marked bookmarks
* '''`m'''' -- `icicle-search-buff-menu-marked' -- Search BufferMenu marked buffers
* '''`m'''' -- `icicle-search-ibuffer-marked' -- Search [[Ibuffer]] marked buffers
* '''`m'''' -- `icicle-search-dired-marked-recursive' -- Search [[Dired]] marked files, including in subdirectories
* '''`M'''' -- `icicle-occur-dired-marked-recursive' -- Search lines of Dired marked files, including in subdirectories

* '''`o'''' -- `icicle-occur' (aka `icicle-search-lines') -- An `occur' with [[Icicles - Icompletion|incremental completion]] ('''`##C-c '##'''')
* '''`O'''' -- `icicle-search-overlay-property' -- Search text having a given [[overlay]] property
* '''`p'''' -- `icicle-search-paragraphs' -- Search Emacs paragraphs as contexts
* '''`s'''' -- `icicle-search-sentences' -- Search sentences as contexts
* '''`t'''' -- `icicle-search-thing' -- Search ThingAtPoint things as contexts, optionally ignoring comments
* '''`T'''' -- `icicle-search-text-property' -- Search text zones having a given text property ('''##‘C-c "’##''')
* '''`w'''' -- `icicle-search-word' -- Whole words as search contexts ('''`##C-c $##'''')
* '''`x'''' -- `icicle-search-xml-element' -- Search the contents of XML elements as contexts
* '''`X'''' -- `icicle-search-xml-element-text-node' -- Search the text() nodes of XML elements as contexts




(You need library '''[[Bookmark+]]''' for `icicle-search-bookmark-list-marked'.  You need library '''[[Dired+]]''' for `icicle-search-dired-marked'.)

There are many `icicle-search-*-bookmark' commands, for searching
within bookmarks of various types.

And there are several `icicle-imenu-*' commands for navigating
among definitions of different kinds.  For each of the
`icicle-menu*' commands there is a '''`-full'''' version that searches
the full text of a definition.

When you use one of these full-definition search commands, the
completion candidates can be quite large, spanning several lines
each.  In this context it can be handy to hide, in buffer
`*Completions*', the lines that do not match your current
minibuffer input.  You can do this at any time by using command
'''`icicle-toggle-hiding-non-matching-lines'''', bound to '''`##C-u C-x .##'''',
to toggle [[user option]] 
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag|icicle-hide-non-matching-lines-flag]]</tt>''''.


[:SearchMumamoModes]
The commands that search zones of text that have a given character
(text or [[overlay]]) property value work with any kind of property.
They work specially for properties `face' (or `font-lock-face')
and `mumamo-major-mode'.  If you use library MuMaMo, which lets
you, in effect, use multiple major modes at the same time in the
same buffer, then you can use `M-s M-s c' and `M-s M-s O' to
search the zones corresponding to a given major mode.  See the doc
string for command '''`icicle-search-char-property'''' for more
information.

Command '''`icicle-search-thing'''' (`M-s M-s t') searches the text of
ThingAtPoint things.  It prompts you for the thing type: [[sexp|`sexp']],
`sentence', [[list|`list']], `string', `comment', etc.  It ignores comments
according to option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-ignore-comments-flag|icicle-ignore-comments-flag]]</tt>''''.  You can toggle
this ignoring using '''`##C-M-;##'''' at any time.  When comments are
ignored, the candidate things (e.g. sexps) to be searched are only
those outside of comments.














[:HowIciclesSearchWorks]
== How Icicles Search Works ==


All '''Icicles''' search commands operate in the same general way:

# Unlike standard [[incremental search]], '''Icicles''' search commands search the ''entire buffer'', not just the
part that follows the [[cursor]].  If the ''[[region]]'' is active, however,
then the search is confined to the region. Some '''Icicles''' search commands let you search across ''multiple buffers'', ''multiple files'', or ''multiple bookmarks'', including region bookmarks. Searching within one or more such regions of text is a '''_first way_''' to ''limit the context'' of a search.

# You limit the search context in a '''_second way_''', by providing some information, such as a ''regexp'' or a [[text property|text]] or [[overlay]] property, that defines zones of text that you want to search.  You can use ([[lax]]) completion against previous input to enter the regexp or the text or overlay property. In some cases, the information (e.g. regexp) to define the search context is provided automatically by the search command; for example, `icicle-occur' assumes that you want to search [[line]]s.

# If you use a regexp to define the search context, and if that
regexp has ''subgroups'', that is, subexpressions of the form
`##\(...\)##', then you are prompted for the subgroup to use to
define the search context.  0 means the entire regexp match is
used as a context.  1 means that whatever the first subgroup
matches is used as a context, and so on.  Using a subgroup thus limits the search context in a '''_third way_'''.
It lets you find a search match within a larger search-match
context.  For example, you might choose an EmacsLisp argument list as
the search context, specifying that it must follow `##(defun ##':
`##(defun [^(]*\(([^(]*)\)##'.  Subgroup 1 is the argument list.
Specifying a subgroup search context helps you become more
familiar with regexps.  '''Icicles''' search highlighting (see below)
shows you the subgroup matches instantly.

# You can limit the set of search contexts in a '''_fourth way_''', by using '''`##M-&##''''
to provide ''predicates'' that search-context candidates must
satisfy.  Command `icicle-search' and its derivative functions use
candidates of the form ##(CONTEXT . MARKER)##, where ##CONTEXT## is a
string, the search hit (search context), and ##MARKER## is a buffer
[[marker]] that locates the ##CONTEXT##.  Predicates you supply to the
`##M-&##' prompt must expect such candidates.  Only contexts that satisfy the predicate are found.  For example, if
the predicate is ##(lambda (x) (commandp (intern-soft (car x))))##, then
only contexts that name Emacs [[command]]s are found.  Or, if
you have a predicate `verbp' that tests whether a word is an
English verb form, then you can use that to limit word matches
to verbs.  In this way, you
can combine purely syntactic searching (regexp or text-property
match) with more semantic search criteria.  After building up a complex predicate by using `##M-&##', you can save it to a [[variable]] with `##C-M-&##' and then reuse it later with `##C-=##'.  See also [[Icicles - Progressive Completion#Predicates|M-&: Satisfying Additional Predicates]].  

# '''Icicles''' finds all of the qualified search contexts, and presents them to you as ''completion candidates''.  As always for
'''Icicles''' completion, the number of search hits (matching candidates), is displayed in the [[mode line]] of buffer `*Completions*' -- e.g., '''`##72 candidates##''''.

# You can ''navigate'' among the source-buffer search contexts, using the [[multi-command]] action keys (`C-next', `C-prior', `C-RET', `C-mouse-2').  The contexts are highlighted in the source buffer(s).  You can ''scroll'' the current search-hits buffer forward and backward using '''`C-M-v'''' and '''`C-M-S-v'''' (aka '''`C-M-V'''').  Whenever the destination would be off-screen, [[user option]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-recenter|icicle-recenter]]</tt>'''' is passed to `recenter' to make it visible.

# As always in '''Icicles''', your current minibuffer input ''filters'' the set of current candidates -- the search contexts, so that only those that contain matches to your input remain as candidates.  This is a second level of matching: looking for a ''refinement pattern within the search contexts''.   And this constitutes a '''_fifth way_''' you can limit the set of search contexts.

# As always in '''Icicles''', this input can be a regexp.  This is ordinary [[apropos completion]], applied to searching. You do not type `RET' to enter this regexp, and you can change it on the fly to change the set of search hits.  '''Icicles''' searching is thus ''incremental'', in the sense that changing your input dynamically changes the set of matching search hits.  '''Icicles''' searching is not incremental with respect to the initial, context matching, however.

# As always in '''Icicles''', you can type some input and then hit
`##C-~##' to remove all candidates that match that input.  Then
type some other input and hit `##C-~##' again to remove those
matches.  Or you can use `##M-&##' to define a predicate, and then
hit `##C-~##' to remove all candidates that satisfy that predicate.
And so on.  And you can use `S-mouse-2' or the `delete' key to
remove individual search hits.  These techniques let you [[Icicles - Nutshell View#ChippingAway|chip away]] at the search set, removing hits that are uninteresting.  This is a very powerful technique for both searching and
search-and-replace (see next), and it constitutes a '''_sixth way_'''
to limit the set of search contexts.

# You can ''sort the search hits'' in various ways.  This can
facilitate navigation and comparison of hits, as well as
search-and-replace (see #11).  And you can define your own
'''Icicles''' search commands that provide custom search orders for
particular kinds of search.  It is likely that you have never
considered being able to sort search hits, but if you think
about it you will see that this can be handy.  If you are
searching across multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks, sorting
helps you compare, visit, and replace related hits from the
different sources, instead of having to handle all of the hits
from each source in turn.


# You can ''replace text while you search'', forward, backward, or
randomly.  You can replace entire search contexts or just the parts that match your current input.  You can use any
replacement string that is allowed by `query-replace-regexp'.  In Emacs 22 or later, this includes '''`##\,##'''', to substitute the result of a ''Lisp
evaluation'' (see ReplaceRegexp for an explanation of `##\,##').  Use the alternative-action keys for replacement: '''`C-S-RET'''',
'''`C-S-mouse-2'''', '''`C-S-down'''', 
'''`C-S-up'''', '''`C-S-next'''', '''`C-S-prior'''', '''`C-S-end'''', and
'''`C-S-home''''.  At the first use, you are prompted for the
replacement string; it is used thereafter.  You can use
'''`##M-|##'''' (`icicle-all-candidates-list-alt-action') to replace all matches.  See '''[[Icicles - Search-And-Replace]]'''.

# When you visit a search context (using `C-mouse-2' or
`C-down', for example), the part of the candidate that matches
your input is highlighted.  An entire search context is highlighted in [[face]] '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-main-regexp-current|icicle-search-main-regexp-current]]</tt>'''', and the part that matches your input is highlighted in face '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-current-input|icicle-search-current-input]]</tt>''''.    All other search contexts are also highlighted (in face '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-main-regexp-others|icicle-search-main-regexp-others]]</tt>'''').  The effect is similar to the Emacs 22+ lazy search highlighting
of [[Isearch]] (except that the highlighting is not in fact lazy).

# User option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag|icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag]]</tt>''''
controls whether the input matches are highlighted within each
search context or only within the current context.  Together with '''`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match'''', it
controls whether the input-match highlighting covers an [[Icicles - Expanded-Common-Match Completion|expanded common match]] among all matches or just the exact input match.  See [[#SearchHighlighting|screenshot]], above.

# If you do not use a subgroup to define the search context 
(as in #3, above), that
is, if the search context corresponds to the entire search regexp,
then up to eight '''[::context levels]''' (subgroups) are each
highlighted differently, using faces
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-context-level-1|icicle-search-context-level-1]]</tt>'''' through
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-context-level-8|icicle-search-context-level-8]]</tt>''''.  This context-level
highlighting is not done if user option
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag|icicle-search-highlight-context-levels-flag]]</tt>'''' is `nil'. 

[:SearchHighlightingContextLevels]
: Here is a screenshot (from <tt>[[icicles-cmd1.el]]</tt>) that shows context-level highlighting. The regexp defining the search context is this:

::: ##(##'''##\(##'''##[-a-z*]+##'''##\)##'''## *##'''##\(##'''##(##'''##\(##'''##([-a-z]+ *##'''##\(##'''##[^)]*##'''##\)##'''##)##'''##\)##'''##)##'''##\)##'''##.*##

:: [[image:IciclesSearchContextLevelsScreenshot]]

: If you type input in the minibuffer, then its matches are highlighted on top of this. For example, if your current input is `e', then each `e' in the search context of the screenshot would be highlighted with face `icicle-search-current-input' (black text on bright green background, by default). Your input match always takes highest priority.

You might have noticed that out of these 14 search features, 6
constitute independent ways in which you can narrow or limit the
set of search hits among which you can navigate.  And another one
(sorting) further facilitates your observation and selection of
search hits.  Restricting the search space and making search-hit
patterns more evident are in fact what search is all about, and '''Icicles'''
offers you some unique tools to do this.

For several '''Icicles''' search commands, including `icicle-search' (`##C-c `##'),
you provide an ''initial regexp'' to define the search contexts (step
1, above).  Why use two regexps to search (steps 1 and 4, above)?  To make
things simpler.  Regular expressions are powerful for searching, but they can also
be cumbersome sometimes.  Why not use one simple regexp to set up
a set of candidates and then, optionally, use a second simple regexp to filter
those candidates? 

This is the same
idea as that behind [[progressive completion]]. And
speaking of which, how would you find a line that contains a given
set of words (each of them), but in an arbitrary (unknown) order?
''Progressive completion''.  Which lines in this doc section contain
the words `which', `you', and `how', in any order?  If you are
reading this doc in file <tt>[[icicles-doc2.el]]</tt>, then just use
`icicle-occur' with progressive completion:

  C-c ' which S-SPC you S-SPC how

That narrows things down to four lines that you can then navigate
among.  Progressive completion gives '''Icicles''' search a power boost.

[:icicle-search-keywords]
[:icicle-search-word]
Like `icicle-occur' (`##C-c '##'), commands '''`icicle-search-word'''' ('''`##C-c $##'''') and
'''`icicle-search-keywords'''' ('''`##C-c ^##'''') are variants of `icicle-search'
that differ only in the regexp used.  Each accepts your input and
converts it to a regexp that does the right thing.
`icicle-search-word' just adds '''`##\b##'''' before and after the word you
type, so that it matches at word boundaries.

`icicle-search-keywords' wraps the keywords you provide as input
with regexp grouping  ('''`##\(...\)##'''') and alternative ('''`##\|##'''') syntax, so that search looks
for ''any'' of the keywords.

"'''Keywords'''" here is an understatement. Each keyword is actually a
''regexp'' and is treated as such, unless you use `##C-`##' to turn on
[[Icicles - Special Characters in Input Patterns#icicle-toggle-regexp-quote|escaping of regexp special characters]].  In that case, each
keyword is matched as a substring.  At the `##C-c $##' prompt, you can
use completion to choose keywords that you have already entered,
or you can use `C-RET' to enter new keywords.

[:IsearchStringAsIciclesRegexp]
As a shortcut, you can use the search string during [[Isearch]] as the initial regexp for `icicle-search'.  You
do this by hitting '''`S-TAB'''' during Isearch.  This ends Isearch and
passes its search string to `icicle-search'.  This can be a handy
way to start `icicle-search', picking up its search pattern by
using, say, `##C-s C-w C-w...##'.  It lets you see the matches of your regexp highlighted incrementally, as you type it.  See [[Icicles - Isearch Enhancements#IciclesSearchFromIsearch|Icicles Search from Isearch]].











[:SearchOutsideContexts]
== Search Outside the Defined Search Contexts ==

For each of the predefined '''Icicles''' search commands, including for
`icicle-search' itself, you can alternatively choose to search,
not the search contexts as you define them, but the '''''non'''''-contexts,
that is, the buffer text that is ''outside'' (in between) the search
contexts as defined.

For example, if you use `icicle-search-thing' and you define [[sexp]]s
as the search contexts, then this feature lets you search the
zones of text that are ''not'' within a sexp.  Or if you use
`icicle-search-text-property' (##‘C-c "’##), you can search the zones
of text that do ''not'' have a text-property value that you specify
(e.g., property `face' with faces `font-lock-comment-face' and
`font-lock-comment-delimiter-face' -- which means all code ''outside
comments'').

To turn this context-complementing feature on and off, hit '''`##C-M-~##''''
('''`icicle-toggle-search-complementing-domain'''') during completion.
This is a toggle, and it affects only future search commands, not
the current one.










[:SearchMultipleBuffersFilesAndBookmarks]
== Search Multiple Buffers, Files, and Bookmarks ==

If you provide a [[prefix argument]] to most '''Icicles''' search functions,
then you can search multiple buffers, files, or bookmarks.

* ''Plain'' prefix argument (`C-u') -- Search multiple bookmarks of
various kinds.  To use this feature, you must also use '''[[Bookmark+]]''' (library
<tt>[[bookmark+.el]]</tt>).  See [[Icicles - Bookmark Enhancements]].

* ''Positive'' [[numeric prefix argument]] (e.g. `C-9') -- Search multiple [[buffer]]s -- you are
prompted for the buffers to search.   If the
prefix argument is '''99''', then only buffers that are visiting ''files''
are candidates.  You can use `C-RET' and so on to
choose individual buffers with completion. You can use `##C-!##' to choose all buffers or all buffers that match a regexp. (See [[Icicles - Multi-Commands]].)

* ''Negative'' numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C--') -- 
Search multiple files in the current directory -- you are prompted
for the files to search.  As for multiple-buffer searching, you can use `C-RET' and so on.

* ''Zero'' numeric prefix argument (e.g. `C-0') -- Search multiple
bookmarks, buffers, or files appropriate for the current major
mode.  In [[Dired]], this means the marked files.  In [[Ibuffer]] or
BufferMenu, it means the marked buffers.  In the [[BookMarks#BookmarkList|bookmark list]],
it means the marked bookmarks (you need '''[[Bookmark+]]''' for this).
In such modes the same behavior is typically available on
another key as well (e.g. `M-s M-s m'), as a separate command.


As a convenience, some specialized '''Icicles''' commands are defined that
correspond to `icicle-search' with the various prefix-argument
cases: '''`icicle-search-bookmarks-together'''', '''`icicle-search-buffer'''', and
'''`icicle-search-file''''.  If you often use `##C-c `##' with one of the
prefix argument options, then you might want to bind one or more
of these commands.  These commands are also available in the
'''Icicles''' [[menu bar]] menu (or the '''Search''' menu, if it exists).














[:UserOptions]
== User Options for Icicles Searching ==

You can [[Customize]] the following [[user option]]s to control search
and replacement behavior.

* If '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-show-multi-completion-flag|icicle-show-multi-completion-flag]]</tt>'''' is non-`nil' (the default
  value), then, whenever you use a [[prefix argument]], '''Icicles''' search functions annotate each candidate with the name of the buffer where the search hit
occurs, highlighted, to help orient you.  The buffer name is actually part of the ([[multi-completion]]) candidate, so you can match against it.  Note that even when the value of this option is
`nil', , if option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay|icicle-help-in-mode-line-delay]]</tt>'''' is greater than zero then you can see the buffer name in the mode-line (as well as the position and length of the search context in the buffer).

* '''Icicles''' search functions that use an initial regexp highlight the first '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-highlight-threshold|icicle-search-highlight-threshold]]</tt>'''' matches for
  that regexp ''at once'' (using face
  `icicle-search-main-regexp-others').  The effect is similar to
  the Emacs 22+ ''lazy search highlighting'' of [[Isearch]] (except that
  the highlighting is not in fact lazy).

* If '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag|icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag]]</tt>'''' is `nil', then
whatever matches your current input (expanded, if `<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match|icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt> causes expansion) is
replaced, within the current search context, when you perform
replacement (e.g. `C-S-RET').  If the value is non-`nil' (the
default value), then the entire search context is replaced,
instead.  You can use '''`##M-_##'''' at any time during searching and
replacing, to toggle the value.


* If '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag|icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag]]</tt>'''' is non-`nil', then
 '''Icicles''' search functions highlight your current input match within ''all''
 search contexts ''at once''.  If it is non-`nil' and
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-expand-input-to-common-match|icicle-expand-input-to-common-match]]</tt>'''' is '''##3##''' or '''##4##''' (which means
your input can be automatically expanded), then
what is highlighted for each input match is the [[Icicles - Expanded-Common-Match Completion|expanded common match]] among all input matches throughout the search area.  If
either of these conditions does not hold, then only the exact input match is highlighted.  For example (see [[Icicles - Nutshell View#IciclesSearch|Nutshell View - Icicles Search]]), if the
initial regexp defining the search context is `##.*recursive.*##',
and your input is `edit', then searching file <tt>[[icicles-doc1.el]]</tt>
highlights not `edit' but `##`abort-recursive-edit'##', which
is the longest common match among all input matches.  

:: '''Gotcha:''' Remember that the expanded common match pertains to the
entire completion candidate.  In the context of '''Icicles'''
search, if you are interested in multiple matches of
your input within the same search context, and you want
to be sure to catch each match, then turn off common-match expansion.

:: Why?  The search context as a whole is compared with the
other search contexts when looking for the expanded
common match.  Your input is matched against the entire
context (search hit), and the expanded common match is
(typically) the longest match that is common to the
other search contexts.  Do not expect the longest common
match of your input against all occurrences in the
search contexts.  What counts is the longest single
match for a given context.

:: For example, if your input is `then' and two of the
search hits are `##But then X and then Y##' and `##W and then Z##', the expanded common match will be `##and then##', not
`then'.  The matches highlighted for your input thus do
not include each occurrence of `then' in the search hits, but rather
each occurrence of `##and then##'.

* When `icicle-search-replace-whole-candidate-flag' is `nil', only
the part of the search context that matches your input is
replaced.  That part corresponds to your expanded input if
`icicle-expand-input-to-common-match' implies expansion and if
`icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' and
'''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag|icicle-search-replace-common-match-flag]]</tt>'''' are both non-`nil'.  Otherwise, it corresponds to only your exact input.  The default value of `icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is `nil', because
 non-`nil' can impact performance negatively if there are
  many search contexts -- the highlighting is updated with each input change.  You can toggle the value at any time using command
`icicle-toggle-highlight-all-current', bound to '''`##C-^##'''' in the
 minibuffer during '''Icicles''' search.

* If option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-cleanup-flag|icicle-search-cleanup-flag]]</tt>'''' is non-`nil' (the default value)
  then search highlighting is removed after the search.  If you
  set this to `nil' then you can remove search highlighting manually
  later using command '''`icicle-search-highlight-cleanup''''.  You can
  toggle this search highlight removal at any time using command
  `icicle-toggle-search-cleanup', which is bound to '''`##C-.##'''' in the minibuffer during '''Icicles''' search.  One use
  of `nil' `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is to ''highlight'' regexp
  matches throughout a region or buffer (or multiple files or...).  In that capacity,
  '''Icicles''' search functions act like some of the highlighting commands in
  my library <tt>[[highlight.el]]</tt> (see HighLight).  Note that when `icicle-search-cleanup-flag' is `nil', ''all'' '''Icicles''' search highlighting remains: last-visited
search context, other context matches, current-input matches, and even
regexp subgroups.  The [[face]]s for these are, respectively:

** '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-main-regexp-current|icicle-search-main-regexp-current]]</tt>''''
** '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-main-regexp-others|icicle-search-main-regexp-others]]</tt>''''
** '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here|icicle-search-highlight-input-matches-here]]</tt>'''' (everywhere, if
`icicle-search-highlight-all-current-flag' is non-`nil')
** '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-context-level-1|icicle-search-context-level-1]]</tt>'''' through '''`icicle-search-context-level-8''''

* Command `icicle-search-word' (bound to `##C-c $##') always searches
for a whole word: your initial
search string is matched only against whole words. Non-`nil' '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-search-whole-word-flag|icicle-search-whole-word-flag]]</tt>'''' makes other '''Icicles''' search commands also perform whole-word searching. You can use '''`M-q'''' while
searching to toggle this option; the new value takes effect for
the next complete search.  Whole-word searching here means that matches can contain
embedded strings of non word-constituent chars (they are skipped
over, when matching, included in the match), and any leading or
trailing word-constituent chars in the search string are dropped
(ignored for matching, not included in the match). 
This means, for instance, that you can match `foo-bar' as a
word, even in contexts (such as EmacsLisp) where '''`-'''' is not a
word-constituent character.  Similarly, you can can include embedded
whitespace in a "word", e.g., `##foo bar##'.


* You can toggle '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]]</tt>'''' at any time using
`M-g' in the minibuffer.  This is handy for 
multi-commands that browse, such as '''Icicles''' search.  It means that you can
use `next' and so on instead of `C-next' and so on to navigate
among search hits.  See [[Icicles - More About Multi-Commands#icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag|icicle-use-C-for-actions-flag]]

* Non-`nil' option '''`<tt>[[Icicles - Customization and General Tips#icicle-ignore-comments-flag|icicle-ignore-comments-flag]]</tt>'''' 
means that
`icicle-search-thing' and related commands
(e.g. `icicle-search-xml-element') ignore comments.  That is,
they hide comments temporarily while they scan the region or
buffer for things of the given type to serve as search contexts
(completion candidates).  This prevents them, for example, from
presenting as a candidate a [[sexp]] or a [[list]] that is commented
out.  You can toggle this option anytime using '''`##C-M-;##'''' in the
minibuffer, but to see the effect you might need to invoke the
current command again.

* '''`icicle-search-hook'''': Functions run after searching and moving
  to a match, whether by `RET' or `C-RET' (or `C-next' or
  `C-prior').

It can sometimes be useful to highlight all regexp matches using
a large (or `t') value of `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' and a `nil' value of 
`icicle-search-cleanup-flag', and then set `icicle-search-highlight-threshold' to zero and use an '''Icicles''' search function 
again with a different regexp to search through the same region or
buffer.  This lets you see the relation between the two sets of
regexp matches.














[:UsingRegexps]
== Using Regexps With Icicles Search ==

You can use '''Icicles''' search to find text entities of a certain
kind -- sentences, paragraphs, file names, URLs, and so on.  A
convenient way to do this is to use '''`C-='''' (`icicle-insert-string-from-variable') or `C-x r i' (`insert-register') to ''insert a predefined
regexp'' that matches a particular kind of text entity. Which of
these you use depends on whether the regexp string is saved in a
variable (`C-=') or a register (`C-x r i').

For example, suppose you are in a mail client and you want to move
between mail headers.  If you use a regexp that matches the header
field you want (e.g. the sent date or sender) then '''Icicles''' search highlights all such occurrences and lets you navigate among them
-- ''instant mail browser!''  Or, suppose you are in a C++ or Perl file
and you want to navigate among function definitions or other definitions.  If
you have a canned regexp that matches the start of a definition,
then you can use `C-=' to quickly turn `icicle-search' into a ''code
browser''.  In a log file, navigate among date or time entries or IP
addresses...  Of course, most programming modes and mail clients
already provide other ways to navigate, but you get the idea
-- '''Icicles''' search provides a ''general'' way to navigate among things,
as long as you can match them with regexps, and `C-=' lets you
quickly access a library of predefined regexps.

You can find useful regexps to store in variables in the standard
EmacsLisp libraries.  Grep for `font-lock-keywords' or `regexp'
in the Emacs `lisp' directory and its subdirectories.

* See ##align.el## for regexps for programming languages.
* See ##url-dav.el## for regexps matching ISO 8601 dates.
* See ##rmail.el##, ##sendmail.el##, and ##mh-show.el## for regexps matching mail-header fields.

[[ImenuMode|Imenu]] regexps occurring as parts of different values of
`imenu-generic-expression' for different buffer types can be used
as variable values for `##C-=##'.  They all work fine with
`icicle-search', turning it into a navigator for the given mode.
See, for example, ##generic-x.el## and ##lisp-mode.el##.  Here is a
regexp for Javascript function definitions from ##generic-x.el##:

  "^function\\s-+\\([A-Za-z0-9_]+\\)"

And `lisp-imenu-generic-expression' (in ##lisp-mode.el##) provides
regexps for Lisp function, variable, and type definitions.  Here
is the variable-definition regexp:

  "^\\s-*(\\(def\\(c\\(onst\\(ant\\)?\\|ustom\\)\\|ine-symbol-macro\\|parameter\\|var\\)\\)\\s-+\\(\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+\\)"

You certainly do not want to type a regexp like that into the minibuffer (and the
function-definition regexp is twice as complex)!  Put it into a
variable or register once and use `C-=' or `C-x r i' from then on to retrieve it -- simple.

If it's so simple, then why not let a command do it?  This is exactly what command '''`icicle-imenu'''' (bound to '''`##C-c =##'''') does. You
do not need to bother looking up Imenu regexps and assigning them
to variables for use with `C-=' and `icicle-search' -- `icicle-imenu' does that for you automatically.  See [[Icicles - Other Search Commands#IciclesImenu|Icicles Imenu]].


'''In sum:''' For complete interactivity, type a regexp dynamically as
input to `icicle-search'.  For isolated special regexps that you
use, save them in variables and use `C-=' with `icicle-search'.
For well-defined sets of regexps, especially if used frequently,
define a command that uses `icicle-search'.  There is a spectrum
of use cases for `icicle-search'.

Command `icicle-search' is very general and very powerful.  It might never replace incremental search -- either regexp or literal
string search, but in some cases it can be quite handy.  Think of
it as another tool to add to your search-tool belt.  Admittedly,
it does take a little getting used to.  Remember, in particular,
that the initial, context regexp you enter (with `RET') cannot be changed
without re-executing `icicle-search'.

And remember too that `C-l' (`icicle-retrieve-previous-input') is your friend -- it clears the
minibuffer during cycling, retrieving your last real input.  Use
it to modify your second  and subsequent
regexps on the fly -- those that filter
the initial candidate list further.  You can repeat `C-l' to retrieve older completion inputs, and you can use `C-S-l' (that is, `##C-##'''##L##'''') to cycle previous inputs in the other direction.  See [[Icicles - History Enhancements]].

Oh -- And do not forget that you can do things like take the
''complement'' of your fine-tuning regexp matches, within the context
of your coarse-tuning matches (see [[Icicles - Candidate Sets#icicle-candidate-set-complement|set complement]]).  For example, use `<code>^.*defun.*$</code>' as the main regexp, to find all lines containing
`defun'.  Then type `icicle' to match only the lines with `defun'
that also contain `icicle'.  Then complement (`<code>C-~</code>') that set, to
see the lines that contain `defun' but not `icicle'.

And you can then ''save''
that set of matches, and then ''subtract'' it from another set of
matches in a ''different search''...  You get the idea. When performing [[Icicles - Candidate Sets|set operations]] combined with `icicle-search', keep
in mind that the saved set does not include any ''position''
information -- it is only a set of matching ''strings''.  So, in
particular, a set-union operation (`<code>C-+</code>') is not useful with
`icicle-search' (adding a saved set of strings without positions
is useless).  Still, you can do things like match lines that
contain `defun' followed somewhere by `<code>()</code>', and then subtract the
(saved) set of lines in the same region that contain `icicle'.
Try it in an '''Icicles''' library, using regexps `<code>.*icicle.*$</code>' and
`<code>^*.defun.*().*$</code>'.

One more reminder: When you save a set of completion candidates
(`##C-M->##'), make sure that you actually ''have'' a set of candidates to save!
It is not enough to just enter a regexp at the `icicle-search'
prompt.  You must also use some '''Icicles''' command, such as `TAB',
`S-TAB', `next', or `down' to tell '''Icicles''' how to create the
candidate set -- how to match the regexp.
