To configure flymake to work with Erlang you need to add some elisp-code to your initialization file, and also create custom script, that will called from elisp code.

== Emacs configuration ==

Following code should be added to your emacs initialization file. The <code>"path_to_eflymake_script"</code> should be replaced with real path to the script, that will perform checking of code

<pre>
(require 'flymake)
(defun flymake-erlang-init ()
  (let* ((temp-file (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy
		     'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
	 (local-file (file-relative-name temp-file
		(file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
    (list "path_to_eflymake_script" (list local-file))))

(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks '("\\.erl\\'" flymake-erlang-init))

</pre>

== Script for syntax checking ==

Following code is used to check validity of Erlang code.  Please put it into some file, and make it executable.  Path to this find should be specified in the elisp code above

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env escript
-export([main/1]).

main([File_Name]) ->
    compile:file(File_Name, [warn_obsolete_guard, warn_unused_import, 
                             warn_shadow_vars, warn_export_vars,
  			     strong_validation, report,
  			     {i, "../include"}]).
</pre>


I use rebar and have hrl files not in the ../include path. Here is a quick hack I did to get all the appropriate include paths assuming a rebar based project. It could be smarter about finding things, but I just wanted to fix the 80% case.

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env escript
-export([main/1]).

main([File_Name]) ->
    Includes = case filelib:is_dir("../deps") of
                   false ->
                       [{i, "../include"}];
                   true ->
                       {ok, Deps} = file:list_dir("../deps"),
                       [{i, "../include"}| [{i,Di} || D <- Deps,
                              begin
                                  Di = "../deps/"++D++"/include",
                                  filelib:is_dir(Di)
                              end]]
               end,

    compile:file(File_Name, [warn_obsolete_guard, warn_unused_import,
                             warn_shadow_vars, warn_export_vars,
                             strong_validation, report | Includes]).
</pre>



[new:Habitue01:] Would it be possible to alter this script to get output from dialyzer as well?
: bkil: I've successfully connected it with Dialyzer! Get it from here: http://code.google.com/p/bkil-open/source/browse/trunk/volatile#volatile%2Fpg%2Fflyerl

Would it be possible to check also .hrl header files?
