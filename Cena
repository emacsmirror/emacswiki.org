Newbie (2025).

True story: I built Emacs from master for years as part of a daily morning routine, and never used it.  It was like a strange meditation. (I now actually use Emacs.)

My current methodology for editing EmacsWiki:

* click 'Random'
* can I make a useful edit to this page in 5 minutes or less?  If yes, do it.  Often this is just updating links, version numbers, or minor typos.
* if not, click 'Random' OR
* edit the more complex page a section at a time. (This is new, so we'll see how it goes.)

I've made it an org-habit to make at least one edit to the wiki every day! (And I also just noticed there's no page for habits; that can't be right, can it?)


== Pages needing something as I come across them ==

=== create pages ===

# org-habit (search again just in case)
# docTex (double-check)

=== update pages ===

# [MulticsEmacs]
# [DotEmacsChallenge]
# [PlainLispForMath]
# [WikiTodo]
# [AutoDownload]

When undoing Spam, it's best to click on the history link (old versions, directly from Recent Changes) and use the ｢Rollback｣ button on the last good revision. This also ensures that the spam revisions no longer show up on Recent Changes. -- AlexSchroeder
