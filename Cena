Newbie (2025).

True story: I built Emacs from master for years as part of a daily morning routine, and never used it.  It was like a strange meditation. (I now actually use Emacs.)

My current methodology for editing EmacsWiki:

* click 'Random'
* can I make a useful edit to this page in 5 minutes or less?  If yes, do it.  Often this is just updating links, version numbers, or minor typos.
* if not, click 'Random' OR
* edit the more complex page a section at a time. (This is new, so we'll see how it goes.)

I've made it an org-habit to make at least one edit to the wiki every day! (And I also just noticed there's no page for habits; that can't be right, can it?)


== Notes to self re: wiki ==

==== Pages which need creating: =====

# org-habit (search again just in case)
# docTex (double-check)

== Emacs Effusions ==

==== Running list of possibly irrational Emacsoid peeves from a newbie: ====

# packages which change the appearance of something and don't include screenshots.
# packages whose documentation consists primarily of a list of keybindings.
# instructions for beginners that focus on lists of default keybindings.
# I'm starting to suspect that many frequently referenced tutorials and/or inits/configs have some ur-source from 1993 or so.


==== Current Mysteries: ====

# what exactly is 'completing-read'
# 'M-x' reappears in minibuffer after issuing command; seems somewhat intermittent.
# how to stop messing with my init, which probably isn't helping with tracking down the above.

==== Grandiose Goals: (a haiku) ====

# create a package
# with great documentation 
# no lists of keybinds

==== Grandiose Goals: (a neverending list) ====

# online code documentation xref'ed between appropriate manuals (Emacs, Emacs Lisp, Org, etc.)
# figure out what the deal is re: Hyperbole (why choose it over Org, etc.). The button thing is interesting, but how different from Org links?
# mess around with Icicles. Currently using the Vertico/Corfu/Marginalia/etc stack, which is great, but these big old packages fascinate me (cf. Hyperbole).  Find others?  Maybe BBDB, but seems mostly used with Gnus(?)
# write an in-depth analysis of Hyperbole vs Org, (a)symmetries, etc.
# same with Icicles vs. current stacks, or in conjunction with them.
# (ask DrewAdams if he minds if I put the Icicles files on github or other forge.)
# secret Emacs project. <not the aforementioned haiku-package>
# I suppose I better learn Emacs better than I currently do so I can get on with gettin' grandiose!
