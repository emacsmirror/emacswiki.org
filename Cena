Newbie (2025).

True story: I built Emacs from master for years as part of a daily morning routine, and never used it.  It was like a strange meditation.

Running list of possibly irrational Emacsoid peeves:

# packages which change the appearance of something and don't include screenshots.
# packages whose documentation consists primarily of a list of keybindings.
# instructions for beginners that focus on lists of default keybindings.

The annoyance with keybindings is because it's part of what kept me away from Emacs and seems, in retrospect, fairly unnecessary.  Now I've come to realize that I can find almost anything with a simple M-x <package-name>, and if I'm not sure, taking a guess at a keyword.  Also disagree with the widely disseminated advice to remove the menu-bar from init; it's very helpful for discoverability.  

I'm starting to suspect that a lot of frequently referenced tutorials and/or inits/configs have some ur-source from 1993 or so.


Current mysteries:
# 'M-x' reappears in minibuffer after issuing command; seems somewhat intermittent.
# how to stop messing with my init, which probably isn't helping with tracking down the above.

Other: non-traditional (eg, old) undergrad in computer science, ham radio, banjo, reading but not playing RPGs, unsolved mysteries, and others without number.
