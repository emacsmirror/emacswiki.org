Newbie (2025).

True story: I built Emacs from master for years as part of a daily morning routine, and never used it.  It was like a strange meditation. (I now actually use Emacs.)

My current methodology for editing EmacsWiki:

* click 'Random'
* can I make a useful edit to this page in 5 minutes or less?  If yes, do it.  Often this is just updating links, version numbers, or minor typos.
* if not, click 'Random' OR
* edit the more complex page a section at a time. (This is new, so we'll see how it goes.)

I've made it an org-habit to make at least one edit to the wiki every day! (And I also just noticed there's no page for habits; that can't be right, can it?)


== Pages needing something as I come across them ==

=== create pages ===

# org-habit (search again just in case)
# docTex (double-check)

=== update pages ===

# [MulticsEmacs]
# [DotEmacsChallenge]
# [PlainLispForMath]
# [WikiTodo]
# [AutoDownload]

When undoing Spam, please click on the history link (old versions, directly from Recent Changes) and use the ÔΩ¢RollbackÔΩ£ button on the last good revision. This ensures that the spam revisions no longer show up on Recent Changes. If you revert spam with a minor edit, regular visitors looking at Recent Changes can‚Äôt tell that the spam has been reverted. It‚Äôs better to think of a ‚Äúminor change‚Äù as ‚Äúdoes not need to be seen on Recent Changes by regular visitors‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs better to hide spam from Recent Changes so the undoing of the spam cannot be a minor change. It‚Äôs just an aesthetic decision, for sure, but still. üòÖ Once you do the rollback, you are presented with a link to ‚ÄúBan contributors‚Äù. Feel free to use it and thereby add the appropriate IP range to BannedHosts. -- AlexSchroeder

Thanks for the info, Alex, good to know for future edits.  Cleared up several vague mysteries of the wiki for me. :)
