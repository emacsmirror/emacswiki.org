User stylesheets are basically not supported or not recommended by major browsers in 2025.  

Is this page obsolete?

Since they technically still work, and since authors of extensions or people using other browsers might still get some use out of them, I'd leave it. A spring cleaning and updating is always good. Maybe even a warning at the top to set expectations might be appropriate.
