[font=Comic Sans MS] I'm a computer programmer from Canada. //Sometimes// I edit this wiki.[/font]

== Helpful Tipsüí°==

`C-c' is reserved for the user to remap. I use it for often-used commands:

{{{
C-c i - ibuffer      C-c s - eshell
C-c m - rmail        C-c w - eww
C-c n - gnus         C-c e - emoji-insert

Built-in keybindings:
C-x r l  - List bookmarks
C-x r M  - Add bookmark
C-h m    - List *current* keybindings
C-h b    - List *all* keybindings
M-m      - First non-whitespace character
}}}

== Email üíå ==

I '''LOVE''' rmail. rmail is small, and simple. it uses emacs' built-in sendmail-mode for composition, and emacs' bulilt-in SMTP facility. But...:

* It lacks maildir support (only mbox)
* It lacks thread-nesting by default.
* Mailutils oddities, i.e. ##%40## in place of the ##@## symbol.

So I looked for some other options...

* //Alpine// -- Only mbox. Perfect threading. NNTP inbox
* //Notmuch// -- maildir. No deleting OOTB. 
* //Mu4e// -- maildir. Ok threads. Overall very clean

I tried MH-E for a while. It uses MH files, which are OK, but: 

* Emoticons get turned into smileys
* The "hide superfluous headers" feature is a blacklist, not a whitelist.
* HTML can't be rendered in the summary
* The docs are a bit bare & it took time to figure it out

== Rust in Emacs ü¶Ä ==

Emacs has *no* built-in ##rust-mode##. This approach requires:

* [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Tree-sitter Tree Sitter]] -- For *syntax highlighting* and *auto-indentation*
* [[https://rust-analyzer.github.io/ Rust-analyzer]] -- The Rust LSP *server*
* [[https://joaotavora.github.io/eglot/ Eglot]] -- The Emacs LSP *client*.
* [CompanyMode Company] -- Provides *auto-complete* suggestions.

{{{
;; First we tell Emacs to open .rs files in Rust mode:
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rs\\'" . rust-ts-mode))

(add-hook 'rust-ts-mode-hook ; Activates when we open a Rust file.
	  (lambda ()
	    (eglot-ensure)   ; Start the language server.
	    (company-mode))) ; Start the autocomplete process
}}}

* Once installed, there's no need to run ##rust-analyzer## externally.
* Company mode may be installed from *ELPA*
* Eglot and Tree-sitter come built-into Emacs.

== See Also üîó ==

Fun built-in packages:
* [[Rmail]] -- Email client
* [[eww]] -- Web browser
* [[rcirc]] -- IRC client
* [[eshell]] -- Shell
* [[proced]] -- System resource monitor


External packages I like:
* [[ParEdit]] -- Lisp programming helper
* [[Elfeed]] -- RSS / Atom reader
* [[Elpher]] -- Gopher / Gemini client

== Bookmarksüìî ==

Links to pages here on the Wiki that I feel need additional editing or care, but do not have the time to really get around to it at the moment.

* [[Scheme]] -- Many outdated links / old info.
* [[Guile]] -- Not sure if this page is even needed.
* GuileIde -- I'll probably not touch this one actually.
* SchemeMode -- On the specific mode for writing Scheme.
* [[Rust]] -- Actually needs a page
* [[Elpher]] -- Could use a page too
* [[Eglot]] -- Needs a page ;-;
* GnusTutorial -- Could use a bit of a refactor
** Reformat Intro to top
** Mention EmacsNewsgroups.
** Add a "Quickstart"
** Shrink ToC (some sections are very short)
** Ensure syntax highlighting
** Bold for emphasis as per StyleGuide
* [[Gnus]] -- This page is virtually empty!
** Could use a "quick config" section
** Several links to important categories
** A "see also" and "External Links" section
* CategoryGnus -- Maybe sort more commonly needed sections to top
