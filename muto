I'm a computer programmer from Canada. //Sometimes// I edit this wiki.

== Helpful Tips ==

`C-c' is reserved for the user to remap. I use it for often-used commands:

{{{
C-c i - ibuffer      C-c s - eshell
C-c m - rmail        C-c w - eww
C-c n - gnus         C-c e - emoji-insert

Built-in keybindings:
C-x r l  - List bookmarks
C-x r M  - Add bookmark
C-h m    - List *current* keybindings
C-h b    - List *all* keybindings
M-m      - First non-whitespace character
}}}

== Email in Emacs ==

I '''LOVE''' rmail. rmail is small, and simple. it uses emacs' built-in sendmail-mode for composition, and emacs' bulilt-in SMTP facility. But...:

* It lacks maildir support (only mbox)
* It lacks thread-nesting by default.
* Mailutils oddities, i.e. ##%40## in place of the ##@## symbol.

=== Other Options ===

* //Alpine// -- Only mbox. Perfect threading. NNTP inbox
* //Notmuch// -- maildir. No deleting OOTB. 
* //Mu4e// -- maildir. Ok threads. Overall very clean

I tried MH-E for a while. It uses MH files, which are OK, but: 

* Emoticons get turned into smileys
* The "hide superfluous headers" feature is a blacklist, not a whitelist.
* HTML can't be rendered in the summary
* The docs are a bit bare & it took time to figure it out

== See Also ==

Fun built-in packages:
* [[Rmail]] -- Email client
* [[eww]] -- Web browser
* [[rcirc]] -- IRC client
* [[eshell]] -- Shell
* [[proced]] -- System resource monitor


External packages I like:
* [[ParEdit]] -- Lisp programming helper
* [[Elfeed]] -- RSS / Atom reader
* [[Elpher]] -- Gopher / Gemini client
