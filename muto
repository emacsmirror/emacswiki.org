I'm a computer programmer from Canada. //Sometimes// I edit this wiki.


== Email in Emacs ==

I '''LOVE''' rmail. rmail is small, and simple. it uses emacs' built-in sendmail-mode for composition, and emacs' bulilt-in SMTP facility. But...:

* It lacks maildir support (only mbox)
* It lacks thread-nesting by default.
* Mailutils oddities, i.e. ##%40## in place of the ##@## symbol.

=== Other Options ===

* //Alpine// -- Only mbox. Perfect threading. NNTP inbox
* //Notmuch// -- maildir. No deleting OOTB. 
* //Mu4e// -- maildir. Ok threads. Overall very clean

I tried MH-E for a while. It uses MH files, which are OK, but: 

* Emoticons get turned into smileys
* The "hide superfluous headers" feature is a blacklist, not a whitelist.
* HTML can't be rendered in the summary
* The docs are a bit bare & it took time to figure it out
