== Description ==

benchmark-init records the duration of time spent in `require' and `load' operations.  By
loading the module early on in the Emacs init file it will essentially benchmark each
Emacs module as it is being loaded.

The results can be shown both in a tabular format or as a tree based on the origin of
the recorded operations.

== Usage ==

Load benchmark-init.el as early as possible in the Emacs initialization file by adding:

[code]
(load "/path/to/benchmark-init.el")
[/code]

The results are displayed by calling either of the functions:

 * `benchmark-init/show-durations-tabulated'
