This is a really simple mode to edit pages on Oddmuse wikis (such as EmacsWiki) using GNU Emacs.

Project is currently hosted on savannah at

* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/oddmuse-el

oddmuse is also at: Lisp:oddmuse.el (not the latest version though).

It works in Emacs 22 and further (if you use Emacs 21, check the section below).

== Important Notice ==
[new:XavierMaillard:2012-04-11 23:48 UTC]
No this mode is not dead (not yet). I just did not have time for ages ;)

[new:rubikitch:2009-02-21 00:09 UTC]
I have switched to [[Yaoddmuse]]. So I'm finding someone to take over OddmuseMode. If you are interested in it, it's yours! -- [[rubikitch]]

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-21 00:32 UTC]
I am interested if no one is taking over it before I do :) But best of
all, why not concentrate our efforts in merging the two modes ?
[[Yaoddmuse]] is doing quite a good job maybe it would be best to
obsolete OddMuseMode ? I do not see any reason to have two different
modes. Anyway, I can take over maintainership.-- XavierMaillard

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-21 12:16 UTC]
I think it's unnecessary to continue use [[Oddmuse]], [[Yaoddmuse]] have all features of [[Oddmuse]].
IMO, [[Oddmuse]] should be obsolete. -- AndyStewart

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-21 17:53 UTC]
We still need to understand why I should stop using [[Oddmuse]]. You
did not give good reasons (asynchronous fetching is not something I
must have). I'd rather want to see efforts in porting [[Oddmuse]]
features into [[Yaoddmuse]] (and vice versa). If nobody is interested
in doing so, [[Oddmuse]] must stay alive thus I am applying to
maintain it (I have several features and ideas in mind). -- XavierMaillard

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-22 03:06 UTC]
: [[Yaoddmuse]] have good *post* functions that [[Oddmuse]] haven't, it very handy to upload your extension to EmacsWiki, you don't need fetch extension page first and modified, then upload it. You just need give *extension name* (yaoddmuse-post-library-default), that's all. [[Yaoddmuse]] added many feature to improve [[Oddmuse]]. IMO, i think Lisp:oddmuse.el need refactory to support *full* asynchronous process, otherwise will dirty code, you can try use [[Yaoddmuse]] download many pages parallel, it won't conflict each other, that's *full* asynchronous process. And [[Yaoddmuse]] have done refactory work. Now, [[Yaoddmuse]] have evolving the code, the only thing that need to discuss is, obsolete or merge?  -- AndyStewart

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-21 19:48 UTC]
:: First, I consider [[Yaoddmuse]] as a non-friendly fork of
[[Oddmuse]]. As far as I can see [[Yaoddmuse]] is heavily based on
[[Oddmuse]]'s code (that's ok since it is free software). What I
totally dislike with yaoddmuse is the fact it appeared one day as if
it was something new and I did not see any contributions by you on
oddmuse to try to remove what was wrong in oddmuse. This is really
what annoy me the most in forks.
Speaking about features, there are interesting things in yaoddmuse. On
the other hand I still do not understand why someone would need
asynchronous fetching, parallel fetching or things like that. Fetching
a page does not take long and thus I do not see why it is a problem to
have synchronous fetching (plus AaronHawley wrote a patch against
oddmuse to add such async process). I also do not understand your
point with "it won't conflict each other". Finally, who is really
editing several pages at once here ? I do not; I am mostly editing
page after page. YMMV :) -- XavierMaillard

[new:rubikitch:2009-02-21 21:03 UTC]
OddmuseMode is yours!
== Features ==

# Visit, edit and post [[Oddmuse]] wiki pages
# Basic font lock (syntax highlighting) support is available.
# Basic and naive new page detection (a short warning displayed on top
of the buffer)
# Easily mark a page for deletion (oddmuse-delete)
# Easily redirect pages (oddmuse-redirect)
# SGML tag support

For a more powerful [[Oddmuse]] mode, see [[Yaoddmuse]].

== Install ==

Add the file to your LoadPath, and add the following to your InitFile:

{{{
(require 'oddmuse)
(setq url-proxy-services '(("http" . "your.proxy.host:portnumber")) ; if needed
(oddmuse-mode-initialize)
}}}

If you plan to edit EmacsWiki, continue reading.

=== Avoiding the captcha in EmacsWiki ===
Some wikis, such as EmacsWiki, use a text captcha to protect pages from being edited.
The following code bypasses this test:

{{{
(add-hook 'oddmuse-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (string-match "question" oddmuse-post)
              (when (string-match "EmacsWiki" oddmuse-wiki)
                (setq oddmuse-post (concat "uihnscuskc=1;" oddmuse-post)))
              (when (string-match "OddmuseWiki" oddmuse-wiki)
                (setq oddmuse-post (concat "ham=1;" oddmuse-post))))))
}}}


== Usage ==

Use `M-x oddmuse-edit' to get started. Use ##EmacsWiki## as the wiki
and ##SandBox## as the page to edit. :)

Use `C-c C-o' to follow links, use `C-u C-c C-o' to specify the target
page yourself, and use `C-c C-c' to save changes.

You can use `M-x oddmuse-post' in any buffer. It doesn't have to be
in Oddmuse Mode.

Note: if post doesn't work, check if you should use the captcha-bypassing code above.

== Emacs Lisp code ==

At the bottom of <code>oddmuse.el</code> is the
following code that bootstraps itself to the EmacsWiki:
{{{
(emacswiki-post "oddmuse.el")
}}}

From the end of the line just press `C-x C-e'.

== oddmuse with Emacs 21 ==

Current oddmuse.el uses url.el which is a standard library of Emacs22.
If you use Emacs21, use oddmuse-curl.el instead. It requires #curl# (a command-line http client, amongst many other things).

* Lisp:oddmuse.el - No external dependency (Emacs22 or higher)
* Lisp:oddmuse-curl.el - Use ##curl## for URL retriever. (deprecated)

== Windows ==

If you use <code>oddmuse-curl.el</code>
on Windows, you'll need to install ##curl## and use a decent shell
for `shell-command-on-region', like:
{{{
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "cmd.exe")
(setq shell-command-switch "/e:4096 /c")
}}}

== Patches & Ideas ==

=== integration with footnote mode ===

Wouldn't it be cool if one could use the usual footnote-mode commands to create footnotes in oddmuse page, if they are not too "unwiki"?

{{{
e.g.

Here [#1] is an example for a footnote is oddmuse.

Footnotes:

[:1][1] no, it's actually here.

}}}

[new]
If we really wanted footnotes, we should support them better. In fact, there's an Oddmuse extension that does just that. I just didn't install it on this site. And to be honest, I see no need for them on the web: I believe footnotes belong to the world of print instead of the world of hypertext. See the Style section in Community:FootNote. -- AlexSchroeder

=== tcsh bug ===

The way <code>oddmuse.el</code> invokes <code>curl</code> doesn't appear to be compatible with <code>tcsh</code>. Here's what I see when I <code>C-c C-c</code>:

[new]
A similar patch has been suggested before by email. I think that there must be a better solution, however. After all, not all Oddmuse wikis will be UTF-8 encoded wikis. That's just the default. And in theory at least Emacs should be able to do this -- similar to how it determines the coding system used in files. The solution will probably involve something with `default-process-coding-system'. Using `undecided' as `coding-system-for-read' has it's problems. The manual says:

: *Warning:* Coding systems such as `undecided', which determine the
  coding system from the data, do not work entirely reliably with
  asynchronous subprocess output.  This is because Emacs handles
  asynchronous subprocess output in batches, as it arrives.  If the coding
  system leaves the character code conversion unspecified, or leaves the
  end-of-line conversion unspecified, Emacs must try to detect the proper
  conversion from one batch at a time, and this does not always work.

But it should be possible to inhibit decoding, insert the raw bytes in a
unibyte buffer, and do something such as call the functions on
`auto-coding-functions' or similar. I just don't know enough about it
right now to know what to do. But using an explicit option for Oddmuse
wikis seems like the wrong thing to do.

What do you think? -- AlexSchroeder

[new]

Though I have not implemented, I think of two ideas:
* Add encoding to each entry of `oddmuse-wikis'. Of course the default is utf-8
    <code>("TestWiki" "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test" utf-8)</code>
* Determine encoding by Content-Type header (curl output).

-- [[rubikitch]]

=== Read Pagename ===

[new]

* Compiling unfortunately fails because of free variables `sgml-tag-alist' and `skeleton-transformation'.
* C-u C-c C-o should also use `oddmuse-read-pagename'

Awesome mode, though. :)

I get an error about `defvaralias' in Emacs 24.  Requiring
SkeletonMode fixes it.

I've also put the `require' for cl.el in an `eval-when-compile' after removing a few unnecessary cl-isms.  I haven't seen an error after using Oddmuse Mode for a month with this change.  Emacs would probably complain during byte compilation if a require 'cl was needed at runtime.  -- AaronHawley

=== Revision Check Command ===

[new]
I think `oddmuse-revision-check-command' should use ##curl## instead of ##w3m##. On OSX, neither ##wget## nor ##w3m## are part of the system, but ##curl## is. I love page completion. :) -- AlexSchroeder

[new:rubikitch:2007-07-01 18:17 UTC]
Hmm, ##curl## does not have html -> text converter but ##w3m## has. I leave it to you. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new]
You probably already knew about the RSS 3.0 "Text" format for Recent changes. Here's an example: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rc;raw=1  to check for the last change to a certain page only, use http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rc;raw=1;rcidonly=SandBox;showedit=1. The default number of days for RecentChanges is seven, thus the URL will give you the last change in the last seven days.

The latest revision of Oddmuse now also supports the "Text" format for history pages: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=history;raw=1;id=SandBox.

The *history* action will only show revisions that are still available on the system, whereas the *rc* action will show all changes within the specified time window. If you don't specify a time window, the default is seven days. You can specify a time window using days=30 or from=1 (where from=n uses seconds since the start of the epoch). Unfortunately looking at recent changes older than 90 days will currently be stopped by RAM limitations on the wiki process. I should work on that code to no longer slurp the entire log file. ;)

Anyway, here are two examples.

Example 1: ##Alpinobombus:~ alex$ curl -silent 'http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=history;raw=1;id=SandBox' | grep ^revision | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2## -> 1065

Example 2: ##Alpinobombus:~ alex$ curl -silent 'http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs?action=rc;raw=1;showedit=1;rcidonly=SandBox' | grep ^revision | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2## -> 1065

Either way should work. What do you think? -- AlexSchroeder

Thank you for information. How about this patch?

=== Follow freedesktop standards ===

I am fed up with all emacs modes putting their files everywhere onto
my filesystem. I mean, I do not want to see all this stuff getting in
my way every time. So I am tweaking/modifying all of them to try to use
the same location based on what is recommended by the freedesktop
team and based on what data it should hold.

XDG_CACHE_HOME policy (see

=== Feature request ===

[new]
Now that Emacs has url-retrieve, would it be ok to add support for it
? I already have something working for the default oddmuse-edit
function but I am not an expert at all and there are probably things I
could not do with url-retrieve (eg. Revision Check Command).

One thing we could already do is to change oddmuse-get-command to
something like 

{{{
(if (fboundp 'url-retrieve)
    'url-retrieve
  oddmuse-get-external-command)

(defvar oddmuse-get-external-command (executable-find "curl")
  "*Tool to use if we do not have `url-retrieve'.")

(defvar oddmuse-get-command-options ...
  "*Arguments to pass to retrieve an url.
This list of arguments should apply either to 
`oddmuse-get-command' or `oddmuse-get-external-command'")

etc...
}}}

What do you think ? There is some small adaptations to do here
and there to support url-retrieve but it is not that
difficult. If interested, we could work in collaboration. -- XavierMaillard

== Questions ==


=== Windows ===

Oddmuse-mode seems not to work on Windows with Cygwin. Or else I am not understanding the guide given on this page. -- KristjánJónasson

Try the latest version, then eval this sexp.

}}}
-- [[rubikitch]]

=== Multiple Wikis, Different Users ===
What is the supposed way of dealing with multiple wikis where you use different usernames?  I'd find it very convenient to define those in <code>oddmuse-wikis</code>. --StefanKamphausen

[new:rubikitch:2007-10-13 15:38 UTC]
Yes. Add site-specific username into optional 3rd element (0-origin). Then define <code>oddmuse-username</code> function to get username. -- [[rubikitch]]

=== url-http bug ===

[new:PhilHagelberg 2007-12-04:2007-12-04 19:58 UTC]

When I try (emacswiki-post "...") I get the error "error in process sentinel: Symbol's value as variable is void: url-http-attempt-keepalives". I see that <code>url-http-attempt-keepalives</code> is defined in the <code>url-http</code> file, so it seems oddmuse.el should <code>(require 'url-http)</code> if it's going to use this variable.

== Problems and Bugs ==
=== 403 Forbidden ignored ===

When posting, the result 403 Forbidden seems to have no effect. This happens if the page in question is protected via the (optional) questionasker module. For an example, check [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/alex my homepage]. Basically you either need to provide the answer to a secret question, or you need to know a (not so secret) additional parameter to supply with the request. -- AlexSchroeder

=== Password Protected Pages without Curl ===

When using the new version without curl and <code>oddmuse-post</code>'ing to a password protected wiki one receives no errormessage.  The old version with curl showed the forbidden message of the wiki itself.

This falls into the same category as my (older) question above how to use wikis with username and password, I think.  -- StefanKamphausen

=== Creating new pages bug ===

When I want to create a new EmacsWiki entry from my OddmuseMode, it
does not work. Instead, it returns the SourceCode of the 404
ErrorPage.

How am I supposed to post new pages to EmacsWiki ?

[new]
When I try it, I get the new page (ie. the new buffer is called ##EmacsWiki:SandBox2##) containing the default text "This page does not exist, but you can [Self:action=edit;id=SandBox2 create it now]." Just replace the content with the new content and you're done. -- AlexSchroeder

[new]
Okay, maybe, OddmuseMode should treat these pages differently and
automatically empty the buffer. I will try to add this to my TodoList -- XavierMaillard

== Asynchronous download and upload ==

[new]
I've tried adding support for asynchronous "get" and "post" functions of Oddmuse mode.  The patch so far is preliminary and ignores interactive bits like the page name completion or the prompt for checking the revision.  I'd rather get feedback on this most minimal patch to see if it is something Oddmuse could use.  I'm sure what I've done could use some improvement, and it should be checked for bugs.  I haven't used it much myself.  Further, this change could be probably written better than I have done so myself.

The patch replaces `oddmuse-retrieve' using the original but only using the asynchronous support of `url-retrieve' instead of `url-retrieve-synchronously'.  The new function added to support `url-retrieve', `oddmuse-response-callback', is also based on `oddmuse-process-response'.  So, there's a bit of code duplication here that suggests a few significant changes should be made to give asynchronous support but avoid duplication.

The original `oddmuse-retrieve' is renamed `oddmuse-retrieve-synchronously', since it needs to stick around for the `oddmuse-revision-check-prompt' and the `oddmuse-retrieve-to-string' functions.  

One change in behavior I've noticed is the buffer is modified (the DirtyBit is on in the ModeLine).  I'd say that's a feature and not a bug, because attempts at `basic-save-buffer' in the code will work now.  I admit, I always liked that visiting a Wiki page would never clobber my local files unless I actually edited and saved . -- AaronHawley

[[Yaoddmuse]] already supports asynchronous access. -- [[rubikitch]]

[new]
Cool.  Is asynchronous something OddmuseMode should have? -- AaronHawley

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-18 09:28 UTC]
: I think now OddmuseMode haven't asynchronous process, because that need changed most code to handle asynchronous process.

: If you see source code of oddmuse.el, you will find there have big
different between oddmuse.el and yaoddmuse.el, because oddmuse.el use
`url-retrieve-synchronous' to handle wiki page, so it will hang emacs
when it work, and fix this problem need `url-retrieve' and use unique
buffer to hande. And those chnage not just a patch to oddmuse.el, need
rewrite all module for hande *asynchronous* process. And the patch's
size is bigger than size of oddmuse.el, and will make the code of
oddmus.el became *dirty*, i need *clear* and *module* code to add new
feature (like post command). So i rewrite new one.  -- AndyStewart

[new]
I'm not convinced the changes to handle asynchronous processing are as significant as you have described.  You could disprove me by showing how my patch is lacking.  Would you?  -- AaronHawley

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-20 20:54 UTC]
I agree with Aaron. In the other hand I do not really understand the
need for asynchronous fetching. This is why I won't use [[Yaoddmuse]].
Can somebody explain the need for this "feature" ? -- XavierMaillard

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-21 12:17 UTC]
: When you fetch *big* page, do you want hang Emacs, [[Yaoddmuse]] will switch edit buffer when it fetch complete. -- AndyStewart

[new]
Having used my asynchronous patch to OddmuseMode for a week, I've found the only benefit is not seeing Emacs freeze up when loading or uploading pages.  I've never once had time to edit in other buffers while waiting for pages to load.

Instead, I've found myself frustrated because after loading a page and issuing commands like `isearch-forward' -- nothing happens since there's no text to search until the asynchronous callback returns it.  Perhaps my patch is lacking, but Yaoddmuse doesn't fair any better, either. -- AaronHawley

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-02-23 18:48 UTC]
: like AaronHawley, asynchronous is not really something I need (at
least for that particular task). Maybe I am wrong. -- XavierMaillard

[new:AndyStewart:2009-02-24 11:03 UTC]
:: Hi XavierMaillard, asynchronous is really useful when get *big* page, i don't like get process hang Emacs, that's really bad. But i want to say, it need *refactory* Oddmuse code to support asynchronous process, not just patch, need rewrite almost code for asynchronous. And i know it's confusion if have two version (Oddmuse and Yaoddmuse), if you like i will remove [[Yaoddmuse]] and rename it to oddmuse.el :) -- AndyStewart
