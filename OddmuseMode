This is a really simple mode to edit pages on Oddmuse wikis (such as EmacsWiki) using GNU Emacs.

== Source ==

* [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/oddmuse-el oddmuse-el] project page, on Savannah

* Lisp:oddmuse.el is an older, abandoned copy hosted on this wiki


== Features ==

# Visit, edit and post [[Oddmuse]] wiki pages
# Basic font lock (syntax highlighting) support is available.
# Basic and naive new page detection (a short warning displayed on top
of the buffer)
# Easily mark a page for deletion (oddmuse-delete)
# Easily redirect pages (oddmuse-redirect)
# SGML tag support

== Install ==

Add the file to your LoadPath, and add the following to your InitFile:

{{{
(require 'oddmuse)
(setq url-proxy-services '(("http" . "your.proxy.host:portnumber")) ; if needed
(oddmuse-mode-initialize)
}}}

If you plan to edit EmacsWiki, continue reading.

=== Avoiding the captcha in EmacsWiki ===
Some wikis, such as EmacsWiki, use a text captcha to protect pages from being edited.
The following code bypasses this test:

{{{
(add-hook 'oddmuse-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (string-match "question" oddmuse-post)
              (when (string-match "EmacsWiki" oddmuse-wiki)
                (setq oddmuse-post (concat "uihnscuskc=1;" oddmuse-post)))
              (when (string-match "OddmuseWiki" oddmuse-wiki)
                (setq oddmuse-post (concat "ham=1;" oddmuse-post))))))
}}}


== Usage ==

Use `M-x oddmuse-edit' to get started. Use ##EmacsWiki## as the wiki
and ##SandBox## as the page to edit. :)

Use `C-c C-o' to follow links, use `C-u C-c C-o' to specify the target
page yourself, and use `C-c C-c' to save changes.

You can use `M-x oddmuse-post' in any buffer. It doesn't have to be
in Oddmuse Mode.

Note: if post doesn't work, check if you should use the captcha-bypassing code above.

== Emacs Lisp code ==

At the bottom of <code>oddmuse.el</code> is the
following code that bootstraps itself to the EmacsWiki:
{{{
(emacswiki-post "oddmuse.el")
}}}

From the end of the line just press `C-x C-e'.

== oddmuse with Emacs 21 ==

Current oddmuse.el uses url.el which is a standard library of Emacs22.
If you use Emacs21, use oddmuse-curl.el instead. It requires #curl# (a command-line http client, amongst many other things).

* Lisp:oddmuse.el - No external dependency (Emacs22 or higher)
* Lisp:oddmuse-curl.el - Use ##curl## for URL retriever. (deprecated)

== Windows ==

If you use <code>oddmuse-curl.el</code>
on Windows, you'll need to install ##curl## and use a decent shell
for `shell-command-on-region', like:
{{{
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "cmd.exe")
(setq shell-command-switch "/e:4096 /c")
}}}

== Patches & Ideas ==

[new:XavierMaillard:2009-04-12 07:34 UTC]
OddmuseMode is now hosted on savannah and is using [[Bazaar]] as its
[[DVC]].

So, in order to submit patches, bugs or anything else related to
OddmuseMode, please try to use as much as you can savannah's services.

=== integration with footnote mode ===

Wouldn't it be cool if one could use the usual footnote-mode commands to create footnotes in oddmuse page, if they are not too "unwiki"?

{{{
e.g.

Here [#1] is an example for a footnote is oddmuse.

Footnotes:

[:1][1] no, it's actually here.

}}}

[new]
If we really wanted footnotes, we should support them better. In fact, there's an Oddmuse extension that does just that. I just didn't install it on this site. And to be honest, I see no need for them on the web: I believe footnotes belong to the world of print instead of the world of hypertext. See the Style section in Community:FootNote. -- AlexSchroeder

=== Previously installed patch ===

(please do not modify this section. I am trying to track all
OddmuseMode contributors and their contributions just in case I need
it).

=== Primitive imenu support ===

This patch provides ImenuMode support to Oddmuse by creating entries for each heading.  A better implementation would make the menu hierarchical. -- AaronHawley
