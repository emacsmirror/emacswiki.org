I rarely write elisp code, I just want to write some code in recent years for everyone to share, to share my love of the community.  -- AndyStewart

Your Deepin is very cool distro,
but i really got difficulties in updating the software (repositories) from the server... 
i usually use the ubuntu varian, and it's very easy to instal new software from the repo.
i hope someday this will not the problem anymore
