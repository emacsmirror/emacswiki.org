[https://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] (HTTP only) is an [[ELPA]] compatible package repository that allows users to upload their own packages. Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of the original code. This is somewhat like major GNU/Linux distributions. 

The repository has had significant availability problems for years (as of 2021), so package users/authors may wish to look at ELPA and [[MELPA]] in addition to (or instead of) Marmalade. 

== About Marmalade ==

Marmalade endeavours to deliver stable releases. This means some
packages are considered stale. 

The repository is now managed by NicFerrier who says he is slowly fixing things.  A recent edit to this page incorrectly identified the project as discontinued; however, as of [[https://twitter.com/nicferrier/status/1322566510578159616 a 2020-10-31 twitter conversation]], Nic is still interested in learning of new outages/breakage.  Issues are tracked on the project's [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade/issues github repository]].

== Marmalade vs ELPA vs MELPA ==

Unlike [[MELPA]], but like GnuELPA, Marmalade is restricted to only free software packages. Unlike GnuELPA, but like MELPA, Marmalade requires no signing of FSF
Copyright papers. Marmalade uses an [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/marmalade-client Emacs client]] to upload and download packages.

Marmalade is a fully EmacsLisp project. There is an [[Elnode]] web application by NicFerrier in [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade|github]].
