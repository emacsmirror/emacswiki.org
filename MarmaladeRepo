: *Note:* The repository has [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade/issues/158#issuecomment-858226196 been down since 2021]]. Consider using [[ELPA]] and [[MELPA]] instead of Marmalade.

[http://marmalade-repo.org/ Marmalade] is an [[ELPA]] compatible package repository that allows users to upload their own packages. Package maintainers don't have to be the same as the maintainers of the original code. This is somewhat like major GNU/Linux distributions. 

== About Marmalade ==

Marmalade endeavours to deliver *stable* releases, so some packages are out of date.

The repository is now managed by NicFerrier who says he is slowly fixing things.

Marmalade has a [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade GitHub repository]]

== Marmalade vs ELPA vs MELPA ==

Unlike [[MELPA]], but like GnuELPA, Marmalade is restricted to *only free software* packages. Unlike GnuELPA, but like MELPA, Marmalade requires no signing of FSF
Copyright papers. Marmalade uses an [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/marmalade-client Emacs client]] to upload and download packages.

Marmalade is a fully EmacsLisp project. There is an [[Elnode]] web application by NicFerrier in [[http://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade|github]].
