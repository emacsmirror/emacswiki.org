In light of all the distributed web scraping going on (see [[2025-07-19]]), I've made some changes to the wiki code that has been serving me so well for over twenty years:
The plan is to change the expensive end-points from [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-9.3 GET] to [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-9.5 POST], even if no web resources is being changed. The result is that what used to be a link to "recent changes in the last 7 days" is now a form where there's a 7-day radio-button that one can choose. The regular link is to the default list of recent changes.

Right now the old links still work but I'm planning to stop supporting them. The web server already classifies them as "expensive end-points" and blocks networks sending too many of these requests. Hopefully this will result in less innocent people getting blocked and in less bots requesting expensive end-points.

If you notice any problems, please let me know.

The most obvious changes should be the following:

- RecentChanges now has a form at the end and no more links to filter it
- Full-text search now uses POST
- Finding matching pages now uses POST
