== Maximize window on startup ==

Use the ##-mm## command line option: ##emacs -mm##, or add ##Emacs.fullscreen: maximized## to ~/.Xdefaults (on linux) to ensure window is maximized to fit screen on startup (useful if like me you try to run emacs on your new tiny notebook with your old config files, only to find you can't see the minibuffer).


=== Microsoft Windows ===

On MS Windows systems, create a shortcut to start emacs, open its property
sheet, and add the command line option (-mm) to the "Target" field.

Or add the following to your [[init file]] 

<pre>
(add-hook 'after-init-hook '(lambda () (w32-send-sys-command #xf030)))
</pre>

=== KDE ===

KDE users see KdeMaximized.

== Set Frame Size Programmatically ==

Elisp commands to set the frame size and position: ##set-frame-height##, ##set-frame-width##, ##set-frame-size##, ##set-frame-position##. This lets you do something like this:

    (if window-system
      (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 80 24))


=== geometry ===

Use the ##-geometry## command line option, e.g., ##-geometry 80x24## will
start Emacs at 80 characters wide by 24 characters high.


=== default-frame-alist ===

Also see the documentation of [[option]] `default-frame-alist'. You can [[Customize]] this variable  to specify the frame width and height you want (in characters).

Or you can do this in your [[init file]]:

    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))


=== X resources ===

Under X, simply use X resources to define defaults for Emacs (or any
other program). The exact mechanisms for this differ, but generally,
you have your X session run xrdb on some file in your home directory,
which is where you'd store your defaults. Common names for this file
are .Xresources (this is basically standard on newer computers) and
.Xdefaults (think 1991-ish). -- EraEriksson

Here's an example for your ~/.Xresources (or .Xdefaults):

    Emacs*geometry:     80x24

== Change Frame Size Interactively or Automatically ==

DrewAdams has written various libraries that let you resize [[frame]]s:

* <tt>[[fit-frame.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[autofit-frame.el]]</tt> let you ''shrink-wrap'' frames to fit their selected [[window]] ([[buffer]]) or all of their windows (buffers). 

: Command `fit-frame' (usually bound to `##C-x C-_##') does this. The resulting size (just big enough to display everything, with no wrap-around or truncation) is determined
automatically, but you have control over this calculation with user variables. Alternatively, with a prefix argument, `fit-frame' prompts you for an absolute width and height. A
negative prefix argument uses the `fill-column' value for the width.
These packages also let you configure Emacs to ''automatically'' fit ''all'' frames.

* <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> lets you ''tile'', ''maximize'', or ''restore'' (toggle maximize) frames horizontally or vertically or both. These commands leave room for the Windows task bar and a standalone minibuffer frame, if present.

NicFerrier has also written some frame sizing stuff [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/framesize|see Marmalade's FrameSize package]]. It uses key-chord by default.

'''See Also:'''
* Libraries <tt>[[frame-cmds.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[doremi-frm.el]]</tt> have commands for ''incrementally'' resizing a frame (by using the arrow keys or mouse wheel).

* [[Shrink-Wrapping Frames]] for more information about <tt>[[fit-frame.el]]</tt> and <tt>[[autofit-frame.el]]</tt>.

* FisheyeWithThumbs for commands to temporarily shrink frames to thumbnail size.
