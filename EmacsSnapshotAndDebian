There are good Debian and Ubuntu packages that provide emacs versions newer than the official packages. One can also install from source for maximum freshness.

== Debian packages ==

=== secretsauce.net ===
Generates and publishes a single weekly snapshot for amd64
Debian/unstable. Instructions and further details are available at:
[[http://emacs.secretsauce.net/|http://emacs.secretsauce.net/]]. The
actual packages are here: [[http://emacs.secretsauce.net/pool/main/e/emacs-snapshot/|http://emacs.secretsauce.net/pool/main/e/emacs-snapshot/]].

=== ganneff.de ===
Maintains ~5 months of debian packages based upon emac git snapshots.
Each's build status can be reviewed at the developer's gitlab
instance:
[[https://git.nsb-software.de/joerg/emacs/pipelines|https://git.nsb-software.de/joerg/emacs/pipelines]].
The actual repository root is at
[[http://emacs.ganneff.de/|http://emacs.ganneff.de/]], and the package
listing is at [[http://emacs.ganneff.de/pool/main/e/emacs-snapshot/|http://emacs.ganneff.de/pool/main/e/emacs-snapshot/]]

The ganneff.de repository does not include an instructions page. To
use it:

1. enable adding a private repository.

{{{
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo apt-get update
}}}

2. get the repository's Apt signing key
{{{
    wget -q http://emacs.ganneff.de/apt.key -O- | sudo apt-key add
}}}

3. Add the repository (replace Buster with your version).
{{{
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://emacs.ganneff.de/ buster main"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
}}}

4. Update Alternatives to ensure it uses the snapshot version of emacsclient. 

{{{ 
    sudo update-alternatives --config emacsclient
}}}


== Ubuntu packages ==

The [[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp|“Ubuntu Emacs Lisp” team]] maintain [[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa|The Official ;-) Ubuntu Emacs Daily Snapshot PPA]].

Unofficial packages built from stable releases are available in [[https://launchpad.net/~kelleyk/+archive/ubuntu/emacs|ppa:kelleyk/emacs]].

== Installing from source on Debian and similar ==

To install a bleeding-edge version of Emacs direct from Git, or build it from source for any other reason, and still integrate with Debian, so your version of Emacs can act as a dependency, one can use [[https://github.com/rrthomas/src-emacs-on-debian|this handy script and Debian package]] by Michael Olson. 

Alternatively, do it yourself. First, use git to get the sources:

    git clone --depth 1 git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git

=== Required Packages ===

The following packages are available through apt and might need to be installed. Check the output from the configure stage described below. Git is for the git clone mentioned above. 

{{{
    sudo apt install build-essential git
}}}

Get the required dependencies with build-dep.

{{{
    sudo apt build-dep emacs25
}}}

=== Building from the source ===

In order to build after installing required dependencies:

{{{
    cd emacs
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make bootstrap
    sudo make install
}}}

A good alternative is to not do a root install:

{{{
    mkdir ~/emacs-20131123 # for example
    cd emacs
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/home/me/emacs-20131123 # for example
    make bootstrap
    make install
}}}

Then use ##~/emacs-20131123/bin/emacs## to start it.


== Optional multi character library ==

For non-latin scripts you might want to add:

{{{
    libm17n-dev
}}}

as a library and:

{{{
    --with--m17n-flt
}}}

as a configure option.


== Keeping up to date ==

You can use git pull to keep pulling. Emacs is often released against tags so you can pull those too:

{{{
    git checkout -t tag-name
}}}

To rebuild it's best to:

{{{
    git clean -dxf  ## cleans up old files
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make bootstrap
    sudo make install
}}}

or use the alternative method to have a prefixed emacs.
