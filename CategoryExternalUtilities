Click on the title to find all pages related to the use of external
utilities such as music players.

If the external utilities are used for the following purposes, refer to the specified page instead:

* when programming, CategoryProgrammerUtils
* to search text, CategoryRegexp
* to edit remote files (ftp, scp, etc.), CategoryFiles
* in a W32 context only, CategoryWThirtyTwo

Using Emacs clients as external editors in other applications:

* EmacsClient -- remote control GNU Emacs from the shell, e.g. edit files from your external mail client using an already running Emacs.  It ships with GNU Emacs and does not work for XEmacs.  Since GNU Emacs version 22.1 it also works on "Windows".
* GnuClient -- does basically the same as EmacsClient.  It comes with XEmacs but works for both.
* EditWithViOrEmacs -- a re-implementation of emacsclient in Perl; the only difference is that it execs "vi" if there isn't already an emacsserver running.
* ScreenServer -- automatically attaches to an Emacs running inside [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU screen].

The reverse, use external applications from within Emacs. Note that only OrgMode currently tries to handle this in the best possible way for each platform. Most of the others simply uses start-process. If you do that on w32 you will have to enter the application path yourself. This is an unnecessary trouble.
(I guess there are similar capabilities of other OS:es but I do not know for sure.)

* ExtView -- open files with external viewer (orphaned)
* MsShellExecute -- take advantage of MS Windows file associations
* OrgMode which is part of Emacs also has this functionality implemented in a cross-platform manner. I would suggest that functionality of this kind use that implementation (and maybe extend it). Then the user would just need to customize it in one place.
* TrivialMode -- register applications to open files for you
* These work everywhere (find-file, DiredMode, etc):
** [[BookmarkPlus|Bookmark+]] + <tt>[[w32-browser.el]]</tt> -- open/cycle bookmarked files (e.g. music, images) using MS Windows file associations
** [[DiredPlus|Dired+]] + <tt>[[w32-browser.el]]</tt> -- use Windows file associations in [[Dired]]
** OpenWith -- open files with external applications.
** SexMode -- It is now using the platorm independent functionality offered by OrgMode for starting external applications. (Note that there are some differences, see the beginning of sex-mode.el.)
** [[Runner]] -- link a set of shell commands to file and directory names while in [[Dired]]. These commands can then be run using `dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!").
