This page describes Emacs commands for navigating among pages of text.

Pages of text are pages only when then are printed. Within Emacs, you can think of them more as sections of text. The sections are separated by page-break characters. The page-break character is also known as the "form feed" character, and it is the same as Control l (`##^L##'), octal 014.

You can search for any character by quoting it, and Control-l is no exception. To incrementally move to the next page, you can thus use `C-s C-q C-l'. Emacs also has some page-specific commands that are bound to keys:

* `forward-page' (`##C-x [##') -- Go to the next page.

* `backward-page' (`##C-x ]##') -- Go to the previous page.

* `count-lines-page' (`C-x l') -- Report how many lines are on the current page: total, before, and after point.

* `what-page' -- Report the current page and line numbers, at [[Point]].

* `mark-page' -- Select the current page as the active region. With a prefix arg ''N'', select the ''N''th next page.

* `narrow-to-page' -- Narrow the buffer to the current page, so everything outside this page is invisible and inaccessible. Prefix arg ''N'' is as for `mark-page'.

* `sort-pages' -- Sort the pages in the region alphabetically. With a prefix arg, reverse the sort order, to give Z to A.

Note that all of these page commands refer to the pages as defined by Control-l characters. When you print an Emacs buffer that has no Control-l characters, your printer nevertheless divides the text into pages. Some Emacs commands deal with these pages:

* `ps-nb-pages-region' -- Report how many pages would be used to print the region, for various font heights.

A few Emacs commands use a different notion of "page", which is related to the window size. See, for instance, `View-scroll-page-forward' (`SPC' in view mode).
