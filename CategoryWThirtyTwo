** stable
*** ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
*** http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/
*** Note that most people will want the bin file, not the barebin file. The barebin file includes only the compiled binaries, not the rest of Emacs. (It's intended for people who downloaded the source and then changed their mind about compiling it themselves.)

** weekly builds
*** http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/

** pretests
*** ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/
*** http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/

*** For other reasons the packages also includes [NxmlMode nXhtml].
*** Untested versions of EmacsW32 (I use them myself though I am not satisfied enough with them) is uploaded more often to http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/DL/EmacsW32/test/.

The buggy version is enabled in 21.1 and may be a useful alternative for those who don't mind the occasional display bug and being a few versions behind.
