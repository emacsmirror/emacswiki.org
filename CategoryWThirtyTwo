Font Smoothing, also known as !ClearType:

* There is a small bug due to incomplete MS documentation of the !ClearType api which causes text glitches during scrolling.  As such, !ClearType support is disabled in 21.3.  The buggy version is enabled in 21.1 and may be a useful alternative for those who don't mind the occasional display bug and being a few versions behind.
