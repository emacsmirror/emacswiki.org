Emerge is a graphical frontend to the UNIX "diff" and "diff3" commands. It is useful if two programmers on a project team both changed the same file and you need to integrate their changes.

Here is the Ediff manual section for emerge:
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Emerge

Also, you might want to set the "emerge-diff-options" variable to "--ignore-all-space", so that emerge doesn't waste your time by displaying differences in whitespace. You can do so by putting the following line in your ~/.emacs:

    (setq emerge-diff-options "--ignore-all-space")

= start emerge faster for git-mergetool =
If you want to use emerge as git-mergetool, and want to start emacs using emacs -Q, then

* create a script $HOME/bin/emerge-for-git, and run chmod +x on it.

    #!/bin/sh
    emacs -Q $*

* set path for emerge

    $ git config --global merge.tool emerge
    $ git config --global mergetool.emerge.path $HOME/bin/emerge-for-git

Now git-mergetool should start emacs using emacs -Q. I still don't know how to use emacsclient for emerge.

* Experiment:
    For emacsclient I put like this in ~/bin/edif
    emacsclient -t --eval "(ediff-files \"$1\" \"$2\")" 
    
    But I have not tried integrating this with git yet.
