Emacs comes with a comprehensive manual.  Access it through [[Info]], either with
the ##info## command in a shell window under GNU and Unix operating systems,
or in Emacs, by typing `M-x info RET' (that's Meta- or ESC x, the word "info",
followed by the return key), or by typing `C-h i' (that's Control-h followed by i).
Starting with Emacs 22, you can also read the manual with `C-h r'.



The GNU Emacs manual is also available online from any GNU ftp mirror or from here:

* http://www.gnu.org/manual/
* http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/
* Available in print from the GnuPress.

You can link to the index entries in the manual using the Manual prefix.
Command, Variable, and Concept index entries can be linked.
If the entries contain punctuation or whitespace characters, you will
need to put them in double square brackets:

* ##Manual:show-paren-mode## -> Manual:show-paren-mode
* ##[[Manual:grep (MS-DOS)]]## -> [[Manual:grep (MS-DOS)]]

You can also provide some *context*. If we're linking to Manual:macros, for example, we are shown to alternatives. If we know that we want the Emacs List Preference link instead of the CC Mode link, we can provide some context: 

* ##Manual:macros (emacs)## -> Manual:macros (emacs)
* ##[[Manual:point]] (elisp)## -> [[Manual:point]] (elisp)

The XEmacs manuals are also available online from here:

* http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/

EmacsLisp authors will want to look instead at the EmacsLispReference.

See EmacsManualLicense for some discussion about the manual's license.

See EmacsManualFormats for discussion about the manual's source markup language, output formats and usage.

You'll note the URLs for the web pages that are parsed in the source code. Currently these are:

* GNU Emacs Manual: Command and Function Index, Variable Index, Concept Index, Top Menu.
* GNU Emacs Lisp Manual: Index, Top Menu.

More will be added upon request. Alternatively, if there is a strong demand for this, we can
maintain a list of URLs on a wiki page somewhere, and tell the script to initialize itself
based on the wiki page. Let me know if you care either way. -- AlexSchroeder

This is a really great feature.  I'm using your script for the hypertext cross-references in the [http://php-mode.sourceforge.net/php-mode.html HTML version of the PHP mode manual].  I can always be confident that it will redirect to the right place.  Look at the ##.html## rule in the [http://php-mode.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/php-mode/trunk/php-mode-src/Makefile Makefile] for PHP mode. -- AaronHawley

 Info-find-file: Info file emacs does not exist
