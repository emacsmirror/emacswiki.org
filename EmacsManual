Emacs comes with a comprehensive manual.  Access it through [[Info]], either with
the ##info## command in a shell window under GNU and Unix operating systems,
or in Emacs, by typing `M-x info RET' (that's Meta- or ESC x, the word "info",
followed by the return key), or by typing `C-h i' (that's Control-h followed by i).
Starting with Emacs 22, you can also read the manual with `C-h r'. Another option is to use `C-h R' or `info-display-manual' which will provide a list of manuals available, including the EmacsManual. 

The GNU Emacs manual is also available online from any GNU ftp mirror or from here:

* http://www.gnu.org/manual/
* http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/
* Available in print from the GnuPress.

You can link to the index entries in the manual using the Manual prefix.
Command, Variable, and Concept index entries can be linked.
If the entries contain punctuation or whitespace characters, you will
need to put them in double square brackets:

* ##Manual:show-paren-mode## -> Manual:show-paren-mode
* ##[[Manual:grep (MS-DOS)]]## -> [[Manual:grep (MS-DOS)]]

You can also provide some *context* in parenthesis, after the link itself. If we're linking to [[Manual:macros]] or [[Manual:point]], for example, we are shown two or more alternatives. You can provide context in parenthesis: it just needs to match somewhere in the URL or description of the particular entry you want to refer to.

* ##Manual:macros (elisp)## -> Manual:macros (elisp)
* ##[[Manual:point]] (concept)## -> [[Manual:point]] (concept)

This features uses the
[http://www.emacswiki.org/info-ref info-ref] script.
You can download the [http://www.emacswiki.org/info-ref.dat database] used.

The XEmacs manuals are also available online from here:

* http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/

EmacsLisp authors will want to look instead at the EmacsLispReference.

See EmacsManualLicense for some discussion about the manual's license.

See EmacsManualFormats for discussion about the manual's source markup language, output formats and usage.
