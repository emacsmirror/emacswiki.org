For working with some R code and/or packages, it is convenient to avoid a smart underscore.
Or, if you just prefer to have a different smart key such as less-than.  
<pre>
(require 'ess-site)

(setq ess-S-assign "_")
(setq ess-my-smart-key "<")

(defun ess-insert-S-assign-mod ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((ess-S-assign " <- ") (assign-len (length ess-S-assign))) ; 11/17/14
    (if (and
	 (>= (point) (+ assign-len (point-min)))
	 (save-excursion
	   (backward-char assign-len)
	   (looking-at ess-S-assign)))
	(progn
	  (delete-char (- assign-len))
	  (insert ess-my-smart-key))
      (delete-horizontal-space)
      (insert ess-S-assign))))

(defun ess-smart-lt ()
  (interactive)
  (if (or (looking-at ess-S-assign)
	  (ess-inside-string-or-comment-p (point)))
      (insert ess-my-smart-key)
    (ess-insert-S-assign-mod)))

(add-hook 'R-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key ess-my-smart-key 'ess-smart-lt)))
(add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook (lambda () (local-set-key ess-my-smart-key 'ess-smart-lt)))
</pre>
